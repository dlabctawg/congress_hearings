"dorgan","Senator Dorgan","","","    The hearing will come to order.\n    This is a hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee. We have \na hearing today on broadband providers and consumer privacy, a \nsubject which is interesting and new, relatively new, to this \nCommittee. It is the second of a number of hearings on this \nsubject.\n    I wish all of you good morning.\n    I am joined by Senator Hutchison who is the Ranking Member. \nSenator Inouye is not able to be with us and has asked me to \nchair the hearing. I chaired the previous hearing on this \nsubject as well at his request, and I am happy to do that.\n    This hearing is to provide an examination of the privacy \nrights of Internet users and the practices of broadband \nproviders. The Commerce Committee has had a long interest in \nthe subject of protecting privacy, and now I feel we need to \ntake a closer look at Internet users' privacy as the field of \nonline advertising develops.\n    I want to make it clear that I understand and I think all \nof my colleagues in the Congress would understand that there \nare many benefits to online advertising. It is an architecture \nthat is important to our economy. It allows many of the sites \nand services that we all know and understand to grow and \nthrive. So this is not an inquiry about whether advertising is \nrelevant or important. Advertising on the Internet plays an \nimportant role in Internet commerce.\n    While most of the conversation about Internet advertising \nin the past years has been focused on economic benefits, \nhowever, consumers say in surveys that they worry about \nprivacy. Survey results released today from Consumer Reports \nshows that 72 percent of consumers are concerned that their \nonline behavior is being tracked or profiled, and they are \nconcerned about that. The poll found that 93 percent of \nAmericans think Internet companies should always ask permission \nbefore using personal information.\n    I think it is the case that the invisibility of data \ncollection practices and users' ability to control their \ninformation is a concern, and I think it is time that the \nSenate and regulators try to understand and focus on what are \nthe privacy questions and the aspects of the issue of privacy \nthat we should be dealing with.\n    In July, we held a hearing on privacy to examine concerns \nabout consumers being profiled and being tracked online. There \nis a lot the Committee has yet to learn about data collection \npractices. We learned some things at the last hearing. We heard \nfrom NebuAd, a company that was working with some Internet \nservice providers to gain access to the content on their \nnetworks in order to provide advertisers profiles of broadband \nproviders' customers. NebuAd later halted those plans.\n    In July, the broadband providers were not able to attend \nour hearing. For many of them, this was a new area, and today \nwe appreciate the participation of AT&T, Verizon, and Time \nWarner Cable. It should be noted that these companies had not \npreviously agreed to provide customer data to NebuAd or similar \ncompanies.\n    We also appreciate the participation today of Public \nKnowledge at this hearing.\n    We will focus on privacy expectations for customers of \nInternet service providers. People do expose themselves online \nby where they go and what they do, and often type in sensitive \ninformation, personal information, and financial information. \nWe have very little competition in the broadband market. As a \nmatter of fact, around most of this country, most Americans \nhave one or at the most perhaps two choices for broadband. And \nas broadband service is so vital to the American people and to \nour communities, we want to make sure that providers are \nrespecting the privacy protections of consumers and that those \nprotections are in place. Internet service providers have \naccess to all of that customer's information and behavior, and \nthe question is what is being done with it.\n    Again, let me emphasize that I appreciate the Internet \nservice providers being willing to come to us today and talk \nabout these issues because the issues are not just important to \npolicymakers. These issues I think are important in the long \nterm to Internet service providers as well.\n    I do think we need to update our privacy laws and we need \nto ensure we have similar protection across platforms. We need \nto protect sensitive information, make sure customers know what \ncompanies are doing with their information so that customers \ncan make informed choices about their participation, and are \ngiven clear information about opt-in or dealing with other \nregimes that might be established.\n    This is the second hearing, and I assume that the Commerce \nCommittee will want to hear more as we enter the next session \nof Congress. Now the Committee is here to listen and to thank \nthe witnesses for testifying.\n    Let me call on my colleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison."

"hutchison","Senator Hutchison","dorgan","Senator Dorgan","    Well, thank you, Senator Dorgan. I \nappreciate your calling attention to this issue, and I want to \nsay that it is an important issue that we look at because we \nknow that there are many advertising opportunities now on the \nInternet, which is a good thing, as the Senator said. It is \ngood for the economy. It is also good for business to be able \nto target advertising and be able to have efficient use of the \nadvertising dollars.\n    I also think it is helpful to consumers to be able to find \nthe products they are looking for, the services that they are \nlooking for in a targeted way, and that provides more free \nservice on the Internet, which is what we all want. So that is \nthe good side of advertising.\n    On the other side, we surely need to be informed. Consumers \nneed to be informed about what online entities are doing with \ntheir personal data information, and of course, since so many, \nespecially in our rural areas, depend on broadband for \ncommerce, as well as health care and education, people are \nputting more of their personal information online. So I think \ntransparency and disclosure are very important.\n    I would say I hope we do not charge into legislating in \nthis area before we do fully understand what is possible, what \nis not possible, what is helpful, and what is not helpful, and \nwhat would help the right type of opportunities but not hinder \nthe overall ways that we can have access to advertising. So it \nis a complicated area and one that we ought to look at, fully \nunderstand before we rush into legislation that could curb our \neconomy.\n    I want to say that I am not going to be able to stay. I \nhave to be on the floor at 10:30, but I appreciate your calling \nthis hearing and I will certainly look at the testimony later."
"dorgan","Senator Dorgan","hutchison","Senator Hutchison","    Senator Hutchison, thank you very much.\n    I share the view.

"","","dorgan","Senator Dorgan","    Ms. Attwood. Thank you very much. Thank you, Senator Dorgan \nand other Committee Members, for providing AT&T the opportunity \nto discuss online behavioral advertising and its important \nprivacy implications.\n    My name is Dorothy Attwood and I am AT&T's Senior Vice \nPresident and Chief Privacy Officer.\n    Senator Dorgan, AT&T appreciates your leadership on this \nissue. It has fomented a necessary and productive discussion \namong all key stakeholders, and it has encouraged our industry \nto listen closely to our customers and take a careful look at \nhow best to engage in different modes of online advertising. \nIndeed, you will hear today a remarkable consensus about the \noverriding importance of a consumer-focused approach to online \nadvertising and the need to ensure that consumers maintain \nultimate and effective control over their information.\n    American consumers benefit immeasurably from our Internet \necosystem, which is rich in innovative services and varied \ncontent information and entertainment. Online advertising is a \nkey component of this ecosystem as it fuels investment and \nenables many free and discounted services and funds today's \nvast diversity of Internet content.\n    But online advertising, especially new forms of highly \ntargeted behavioral advertising, also raise important consumer \nprivacy concerns that policymakers and industry must carefully \nweigh. Setting proper policy in this area is crucial to \nmaximizing the consumer benefit of a healthy Internet \nmarketplace.\n    Online behavioral advertising is the practice of tracking a \nconsumer's web browsing and search activity across unrelated \nWebsites. Notably, both the tracking and the association of the \nwebsites are largely invisible to the end user and the \nresulting information is used to create a distinct user profile \nand deliver highly targeted or personalized advertising. It is, \nindeed, a next generation capability and it can clearly be \ndistinguished from the simple and longstanding practice of \ntracking a consumer's use of an individual Website or obviously \nrelated Websites.\n    AT&T does not today engage in online behavioral advertising \neither through the so-called ``deep packet'' inspection or any \nother technique. Of course, if done properly, the practice can \nbe valuable to consumers and can measurably improve their \nonline experience. But we believe just as strongly that it is \nessential to include strong privacy protections in the design \nof any online behavioral advertising program and that any \nprivacy framework should shed clarifying light on what is today \nsomething quite invisible to the consumer.\n    Thus, we will engage in online behavioral advertising only \nafter validating the various technologies and only after \nestablishing clear and consistent methods to ensure the \nprotection of and ultimate consumer control over consumer \ninformation. Our deployment of any online behavioral \nadvertising practice will be governed by the imperative of \nmeaningful consent and a consumer-focused privacy framework \nbased on the following principles: transparency, customer \ncontrol, privacy protection, and customer value.\n    More specifically, we believe that a forward-looking \nadvertising practice requires a forward-looking customer notice \nand consent model. For this reason, AT&T will not use consumer \ninformation for online behavioral advertising without an \naffirmative advance action by the customer that is based on a \nclear explanation of how the consumer's action will affect the \nuse of her information. This means that a consumer's failure to \nact will not result in any collection and use of that \nconsumer's information for online behavioral advertising \npurposes by default.\n    Even though AT&T and most other Internet service providers \ndo not engage in online behavioral advertising, make no \nmistake, this practice is well underway today. Already ad \nnetworks and search engines track and store a vast trove of \ndata about consumers' online activities, and the technologies \nthey use have evolved just beyond tracking consumers' web \nsurfing activity at sites at which they sell advertising. They \nnow also have the ability to observe a user's entire web \nbrowsing experience at a granular level. If anything, this \nlargely invisible practice of ad networks and search engines \nraise at least the same privacy concerns as do other online \nbehavioral techniques that ISPs could employ.\n    For this reason, we believe that any privacy framework for \nonline behavioral advertising must apply to all entities \ninvolved in Internet advertising, including ad networks, search \nengines, and ISPs. A policy regime that applies only to one set \nof actors will arbitrarily favor one business model or \ntechnology over another, but most importantly represent only a \npartial and entirely unpredictable solution for consumers.\n    Thus, we urge all entities that engage in online behavioral \nadvertising, including especially those who already are \nengaging in the practice, to join AT&T in committing to a \npolicy of advance, affirmative consumer consent.\n    Again, thank you for the opportunity to speak here today, \nand I look forward to your questions."

But we think the future is about \n        much more than just customized advertising.

That is the ultimate promise of the technological \n        advances that are emerging in the market today.\nCall to Action\n    We believe these principles offer a rational approach to protecting \nconsumer privacy while allowing the market for Internet advertising and \nits related products and services to grow. But, in order for consumers \ntruly to be in control of their information, all entities involved in \nInternet advertising, including ad networks, search engines and ISPs, \nwill need to adhere to a consistent set of principles. A policy regime \nthat applies only to one set of actors will arbitrarily favor one \nbusiness model or technology over another and, more importantly, \nrepresent only a partial and entirely unpredictable solution for \nconsumers. After all, consumers do not want information and control \nwith respect to just a subset of potential online advertising or the \ntracking and targeting that might underlie those ads. Thus, we urge all \nentities that engage in online behavioral advertising--including \nespecially those who already engage in the practice--to join AT&T in \ncommitting to a policy of advance, affirmative consumer consent."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","dorgan","Senator Dorgan","    Mr. Stern. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Members of the \nCommittee. My name is Peter Stern. I am Executive Vice \nPresident and Chief Strategy Officer at Time Warner Cable.\n    I am pleased to testify before you today and appreciate \nthis Committee's diligent effort to grapple with the complex \nand still-evolving Internet advertising marketplace and to \nassess its impact on consumer privacy.\n    Presently, Time Warner Cable does not engage in targeted \nInternet advertising as an ISP or as a Website operator.\n    If Time Warner Cable decides to engage in such activities, \nour customers' privacy will be a fundamental consideration. The \nprotection of subscriber privacy is not only important as a \nmatter of public policy. Our ability to succeed depends on \nwinning and retaining the trust of our customers. Accordingly, \nwe support a framework that would provide consumers with the \nopportunity to affirmatively consent to receive online targeted \nadvertising.\n    We believe that achieving and sustaining our subscribers' \ntrust requires adhering to a privacy framework that addresses \nfour principles: first, giving customers control; second, \nproviding transparency and disclosure; third, safeguarding \npersonal information; and fourth, providing customers with \nvalue.\n    Let me also add, however, that any such framework can only \ntruly protect the privacy interests of consumers if it is \nuniversally adopted by all providers of targeted online \nadvertising. Quite simply, it makes no difference to a consumer \nwhether a targeted online ad is based on data collected by an \nISP, an ad network, or an applications provider. A framework \nthat leaves any provider uncovered would leave all users \nunprotected. In addition, common rules are the only way to \nensure all businesses can compete on a level playing field.\n    Let me elaborate briefly on the four principles I have \nmentioned.\n    First, customer control means consumers will be able to \nexercise affirmative consent before having their online \nactivities collected and used for targeted online advertising. \nInternet subscribers that decline to consent or fail to act \nshould not have their online activities tracked or used for \ntargeted online advertising. Control also means that the \nconsent mechanism should be easy to use. Customers should be \nfree to change their election at any time, and their election \nwill remain in effect unless they change it.\n    Second, transparency and disclosure means ensuring that a \ncustomer's consent to targeted online advertising is informed. \nThis means giving Internet users clear and timely notice \nregarding what is collected, how it is used, and what consumers \nneed to do if they do not want to participate. And by this, we \ndo not mean fine print. We mean prominent and plain English.\n    Third, safeguarding information means preventing \nunauthorized access to customers' personal information. It also \nmeans preventing disclosure or sale of such information to \nthird parties absent consent of the customer.\n    Last, providing value means offering targeted online \nadvertising in a manner that enhances the Internet experience \nfor consumers. Instead of a barrage of irrelevant ads, \nconsumers can receive ads tailored to reflect their interests. \nTargeted online advertising can also be used to protect \nconsumers from seeing ads they do not want. Advertising can be \na public good when it educates consumers about relevant \nchoices.\n    Most companies that provide services on the Internet are \npresently under no obligation to disclose or obtain consent for \nthe collection and use of consumers' online information. While \nsome provide disclosure and give consumers the ability to opt \nout, this falls short of the principle of consumer control I \nhave articulated.\n    Therefore, Time Warner Cable believes that the four \nprinciples I have outlined should serve as a policy framework \nthat would apply to all companies involved in targeted online \nadvertising. Time Warner Cable stands ready to work with this \nCommittee and other stakeholders to help foster the development \nand implementation of such a framework.\n    I thank the Members of this Committee for the opportunity \nto appear before you today on this important issue, and I would \nbe happy to answer any questions you might have."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","dorgan","Senator Dorgan","    Mr. Tauke. Verizon is not engaged in behavioral \nadvertising, but we are very much aware of the concerns that \nhave been expressed by consumers and this Committee about some \nof the practices that other Internet players are engaged in to \nsend targeted advertising to consumers. Therefore, we have \nfocused attention within Verizon on what policies and practices \nrelated to online advertising we should follow to keep faith \nwith our own customers. And we've looked at what practices \nwould work for the entire on-line industry.\n    Perhaps it would be useful if I just outlined the framework \nof our thinking.\n    First, we focused on the consumer and tried to look at the \nissue from his or her perspective. It seemed clear to us that \nconsumers want information so they know what is going on. They \nwant to be in control of their online experience, and they want \nto be able to choose whether or not their online usage is \ntracked and used to send them targeted advertising.\n    Second, we concluded that any policy governing online \nadvertising should be centered around the notion of meaningful \nconsent by the consumer. We had a lot of discussion about opt \nin and opt out. We concluded that those terms are not \nparticularly meaningful in the online world. Most consumers, I \nsuspect, are like me. We are trying to do something online. The \nscreen pops up. We hit ``OK'' or ``continue'' and move on, not \nreally aware of what we just opted into.\n    So we focused on the concept of meaningful consent and what \nthat means. Our sense is that meaningful consumer consent in \nthis context requires three elements.\n    One, transparency. That means conspicuous and clearly \nexplained disclosure to consumers about what types of data are \ncollected for what purposes and how it will be used.\n    Affirmative choice is the second principle. With knowledge \nof what they are choosing, consumers would have to \naffirmatively act, affirmatively agree to permit tracking of \ntheir online activity.\n    And third, consumer control. Consumers should have the \nongoing ability to change their choice.\n    Senator Dorgan, you put this pretty well in a previous \nhearing on this issue when you talked about a consumer going \ninto the mall. I believe it was your daughter. If you walk into \nthe store and the store keeps track of what you are doing and \nbuying so they can bill you at the end, you know, you probably \nthink that is OK. And if you do not like it, you walk out. But \nif someone starts following you around the mall tracking your \nactivity from store to store, you would feel pretty uneasy \nabout that, I suspect, unless you had invited them along.\n    Using that analogy, what we believe is that before anyone \nfollows a consumer around online to target them for \nadvertising, that the consumer must know what is going on, must \nmake an affirmative choice to permit that activity, and should \nbe able to turn around at any time and say, I do not want you \nfollowing me around anymore.\n    We have been talking to other companies engaged in online \nservices, and we believe that there is a lot of support, as \nevidenced here today, for the recommendations we are making in \nthe testimony I submitted to the Committee. Really, everyone \nshould embrace policies that put the consumer in control of the \nonline experience, and from consumers' perspective, it really \ndoes not matter who is doing the behavioral advertising, \nwhether it is companies providing their browser or their search \nengine, their access, or any other online service. All online \nplayers should protect the privacy of online users.\n    The advertising industry, importantly, also appears to be \ninterested in establishing a set of consistent best practices. \nThat industry has a pretty good record of self-policing, with \nthe Federal Trade Commission helping ensure that the \nadvertising industry's best practices are enforced to protect \nconsumers.\n    With that model in mind, we are reaching out to the online \nindustry to see if we can develop a set of best practices for \nonline advertising that will protect consumers. And we will \nwork with this Committee and other interested organizations to \nfigure out how we can make sure the consumers feel secure and \nin charge when they are online, that the rapidly advancing \ncommunications and information processing technology is used to \nenhance consumers' online experience, not spoil it, and that \nthe Internet continues to open new worlds of opportunities for \neach of us.\n    Thank you very much."

"","","dorgan","Senator Dorgan","    Ms. Sohn. Senator Dorgan, Members of the Committee, thanks \nfor giving me the opportunity today to testify on behalf of \nInternet users.\n    I would like to focus my comments on the growing use of \ntechnologies known as deep packet inspection, or DPI.\n    The use of DPI technology has serious implications for the \nprivacy rights of Americans. Public Knowledge, in partnership \nwith Free Press, has been analyzing these technologies and \ntheir impact on both privacy and an open Internet. Our \norganizations published a white paper entitled NebuAd and \nPartner ISPs: Wiretapping, Forgery, and Browser Hijacking, \nwhich examined the technical and policy aspects of DPI. I \napplaud the Committee for its scrutiny of the use of these \ntechnologies.\n    Simply put, DPI is the Internet equivalent of the Postal \nService reading your mail. While a postal worker might read \nyour mail for any number of reasons, the fact remains that your \nletter is being read by the very person whose job it is to \ndeliver it.\n    When you use the Internet for web browsing, e-mail, or any \nother purpose, the data you send and receive is broken up into \nsmall chunks called packets. These packets are wrapped in \nenvelopes which, much like paper envelopes, contain addresses \nfor both the sender and the receiver, though they contain \nlittle information about what is inside.\n    Until recently, when you handed that envelope to your ISP, \nthe ISP simply read the address, figured out where to send the \nenvelope, and handed it off to the proper mail carrier.\n    Now we understand that some ISPs are opening these \nenvelopes, reading their contents, and keeping varying amounts \nof information about the communications inside for their own \npurposes. In many cases, ISPs are actually passing copies of \nthe envelopes on to third parties who, in turn, read and make \nuse of that information. For the most part, customers are not \naware that their ISPs are engaging in this behavior. The end \nresult is much like if the Postal Service were to open your \nletter, photocopy it, hand that copy to a third party, and then \nreseal the letter so that you would never know it had been \nopened in the first place.\n    So far, we have seen ISPs like Comcast use DPI as a means \nto identify and block certain types of Internet traffic, in \nviolation of the FCC's Internet policy statement. We have also \nseen advertising companies like NebuAd use DPI to collect \nbrowsing histories, online habits, and other potentially \npersonal information about users in order to display \nadvertisements targeted to a specific user's interests.\n    The very nature of DPI raises grave privacy concerns.\n    As a result, when evaluating an implementation of DPI, \nthere are three basic questions that must be answered in order \nto assess both the impact on the user's privacy and the \nacceptability of the use of the technology in question. First, \nwhat purpose is the collected data being used for? Second, how \nis the data collected and utilized? Third, how is affirmative \ninformed consent obtained?\n    Given the power of DPI and the scope of its possible uses, \nit is critical that we establish industry guidelines and legal \nprotections for users. And while the use of personal data by \nweb service providers is not the focus of today's hearing, such \nuses raise separate, yet important privacy questions.\n    Thus, any solution should strive to be comprehensive in \nscope and ensure that the basic principles of privacy \nprotection are applied across the entire Internet ecosystem. \nThese protections must ensure, first, that the purpose of the \nuse of consumer data is one that is consistent with users' \nprivacy expectations; second, that the amount and type of data \ncollected is narrowly tailored to the proposed use and that the \ndata is not kept or disseminated to third parties past what is \nnecessary; and third, that customers have access to and \nactually receive adequate information about the proposed use \nand have affirmatively and actively consented to any practices \nthat might violate their privacy expectations.\n    To achieve these goals, Congress should pass legislation \nthat encapsulates these requirements and makes clear that the \nFCC has the power to enforce them.\n    Even though the Communications Act aims to provide \ncomprehensive privacy protection for users of all \ncommunications technologies, gaps in the law have allowed the \nprivacy of some Internet users to fall through the cracks. The \ntime has now come to address these inequalities and guarantee \nthe right to privacy for all Internet users.\n    In closing, I want to make one extra comment about the \nlegislation. I want to commend the ISPs to my right for \nadopting the principles they have announced today, \ntransparency, control, privacy protection, consumer value. But \nthe problem is that the ISPs that are not here are the ones \nthat use NebuAd and the ones that told Representative Markey \nand Representative Barton that they thought that they were \nacting within the law. And that is why I believe you need \ncomprehensive legislation to ensure that all ISPs and not just \nthe good guys are protecting users' privacies.\n    Public Knowledge is eager to work with the Committee to \ncraft privacy legislation that will protect all Internet users.\n    I look forward to your questions."

"","","dorgan","Senator Dorgan","    An understanding of these questions can inform legislators and \npolicymakers in the formation of policies, which will adequately \nprotect users of Internet connections and services. The uses for DPI \nare myriad, and most raise serious privacy concerns, but each use \nshould be measured individually against a comprehensive privacy policy.\n    It is also important to note that there are two parties to any \nInternet communication. In almost all cases, the party on the other end \nof a user's line will have no meaningful ability at all to know what \nkind of monitoring is being employed by that user's ISP or what is \nbeing done with the collected data, and will have no opportunity at all \nto give or to deny consent. For example, if I send you an e-mail and my \nISP is using DPI to read the contents of my e-mails, your privacy has \njust been violated without your knowledge or consent. Any comprehensive \nprivacy policy that addresses technologies like DPI must take into \naccount not only the privacy rights of an ISP's customers, but also \nthose of anyone who communicates with these customers.\nA. Purpose\n    Given DPI's potential to be used as an intrusive tool, we must \nfirst ask why the user's traffic is being collected or analyzed at all. \nIs the use of DPI integral to the functioning of the network or is the \ntechnology simply being used to provide the ISP with an additional \nrevenue stream? Does the technology in question primarily benefit the \nISP's bottom line, or does it give direct benefits to the customer's \nuse of the Internet? Is it used to protect users or the integrity of \nthe network, or simply to offer new or improved additional services?\n    Not all uses of DPI are inherently problematic. The first \nwidespread uses of DPI were for security purposes: to stop malicious \nprograms like viruses and worms from passing from one infected computer \nto another over the Internet. However, as seen in the recent complaint \nand decision against Comcast at the Federal Communications Commission \n(FCC), DPI can also be used to engage in impermissible, discriminatory \nnetwork management practices. Taken to an extreme, we can even imagine \na future where DPI is used to record and disseminate every single move \na user makes on the Internet--from web browsing, e-mail and instant \nmessaging to VoIP phone calls and video chats--to the ISP's own \nbusiness advantage.\n    Understanding the purpose of DPI use is the first step to \nunderstanding whether that use will violate a user's expectations of \nprivacy.\nB. Collection\n    After we understand the purpose of a particular use of DPI, we can \nanalyze how the data is collected and used toward that purpose. Is the \nuser's data being collected by the ISP for its own use, or is it being \npassed to a third party with no connection to the user? Is all of the \nuser's data collected, or a smaller subset of the data? Is the amount \ncollected narrowly tailored to achieve the stated purpose, or broader \nthan necessary, or is the amount of data actually used smaller than \nthat collected?\n    It is important to note here that we should evaluate both the \namount of data which reaches the party using it, and the amount of that \ndata which is used. This is because additional data that is sent to a \nthird party provides more opportunity for abuse of user privacy--even \nif that third party later chose to discard some of the more personal \ninformation. For instance, even though companies like Knobbed may \nchoose to ignore the personal medical records or e-mails of its \npartner's customers, they were provided the data to do exactly that. \nThis problem is compounded by the fact that an ISP or partner must \nengage in DPI to even discover what type of data is being transmitted, \nthereby possibly violating the user's privacy before any decision is \nmade regarding what is to be done with the data.\n    It is also necessary to identify the ways in which the collected \ndata might be tied to the user's actual identity. Is the data obtained \nusing DPI explicitly tied to data obtained through other means--for \nexample, the ISP's billing information, demographic information, or \npersonal information stored on a third-party website? Can the collected \ndata be later aggregated with this type of information? Will the data \nitself contain personally identifying information (PII), such as names, \naddresses, and credit card information submitted to websites? These \nquestions are important because if the data in question contains PII or \nif it is later connected with other user data, the privacy implications \nare multiplied.\n    Implicit in the data collection question are also questions about \ndata storage. Is the collected data kept by the party using it? If so, \nfor how long? Is it kept in its original, complete form, or in some \ntype of summary? Is any PII kept with the stored data?\n    Understanding what and how data is collected and how well that \ncomports with the stated purpose of the collection is necessary to \nevaluating whether the collection will violate users' privacy \nexpectations.\nC. Consent\n    No inspection of a user's data will be acceptable without that \nuser's affirmative, informed consent or law enforcement obligations. To \nensure this is obtained, we must evaluate both how users are notified \nof the ways in which their ISP and its partners intend to use DPI, and \nthe method by which those users affirmatively consent (or decline to \nconsent) to those uses. To do this, we must ensure that before a user's \ndata is inspected, the user actually receives complete, useful \ninformation, and that the user knowingly and affirmatively assents to \nthe stated uses.\n    Are the answers to the above questions about purpose and collection \naccessible for users, and complete in the information they divulge? If \nany third parties are involved in the monitoring, are their identities \nprovided for the user? Are the answers written so that the average user \ncan make sense of them? Are the policies in question detailed in a \nplace and manner that ensures that the user is likely to read them? Is \nthe user actively notified of the presence of and changes to policies \nand monitoring activities, or are changes made to web pages and written \ninto the Terms of Service--without any notification to the user? \nWithout accurate and easily understandable information that a user is \nactually aware of, that user cannot make informed choices about how \nbest to manage his or her privacy online.\n    Finally, what is the process by which users agree (or decline to \nagree) to the use of these technologies? Are they subject to DPI before \nthey receive meaningful notice of its use, or is the user required to \ntake an affirmative action before his or her data is recorded or \nanalyzed? Is the information and the action specific to the monitoring \nactivities, or is it hidden in a larger ``Acceptable Use Policy,'' \n``End User License Agreement,'' or other document? Does the user have \nthe meaningful ability to change his or her choice later? Is the user \nactively offered a periodic chance to withdraw consent, or is he or she \nonly asked once? And is the option not to consent a real one, without \ncrippling or disabling of the user's service as the only alternative?\n    Without meaningful, informed, affirmative consent on the part of \nthe user, personal data should not be used for any purpose that is not \nnecessary to providing basic Internet service.\nIV. ISP Disclosures\n    In response to Chairman Dingell and Ranking Member Barton's letter, \n33 ISPs and software companies described whether and how they were \nusing DPI and whether and how they were disclosing those uses to their \ncustomers.\\11\\ These responses are helpful in understanding how, to \ndate, the above three questions have been answered unsatisfactorily.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\11\\ All 33 response letters are available at the House Energy and \nCommerce Committee's Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the \nInternet website at http://energycommerce.house\n.gov/Press_110/080108.ResponsesDataCollectionLetter.shtml.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Carriers that responded to the letter fell into two basic camps. \nThe first group of ISPs did not employ Knobbed's services and did not \nuse any similar DPI equipment. These ISPs generally had not deployed \nany technologies that could track individual users' browsing habits or \ncorrelate advertising information with personal information possessed \nby the ISP.\\12\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\12\\ See, e.g., Response Letters of AT&T, Verizon, and Time-Warner.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    The second camp contained those ISPs who performed trials of or \ndeployed third-party DPI-based behavioral advertising systems.\\13\\ \nImportantly, these ISPs generally did not inspect user data themselves, \nbut passed it off to their partners for analysis. According to these \nISPs, they were assured that measures were in place to ensure that \nthose partners did not retain medical information, personal data, e-\nmails, or other types of especially sensitive data.\\14\\ Also, all of \nthese ISPs stated that they and Knobbed did not tie the tracked \nInternet data to personal customer data already known to the ISP \n(billing information, etc.).\\15\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\13\\ See, e.g., Response Letters of WOW!, Charter Communications, \nKnology, and CenturyTel.\n    \\14\\ See Response Letter of Charter Communications 2.\n    \\15\\ See Response Letter of Knology 1.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    However, as a technical matter, the personal data embedded in a \nuser's Internet communications was handed off to the ISP's partners, \nwhen the ISP itself is actually responsible for safeguarding its users \ndata. In some cases, the identity of the partner was not divulged to \nthe user. These partners had no direct interactions with the user, \nmeaning that final control of what data was used and how rested not \nwith the user or even the ISP, but with this third party. To return to \nthe postal service analogy, it is as if the ISPs photocopied users' \nletters and handed these copies to third parties, who agreed to only \nwrite down which commercial products were mentioned in the letters, and \nnot anything else that someone might consider sensitive. However, the \ndecision as to what, exactly, should be considered `sensitive,' is not \nmade by the user but rather, by this third-party company.\n    Customer notification and consent varied from ISP to ISP, but there \nwere significant trends. ISPs generally posted modified terms of \nservice and often updated the `Frequently Asked Questions' section on \ntheir websites, but usually declined to directly contact users or call \nattention to the significance of the new service. Knology, for \ninstance, updated their Customer Service Agreement on their website, \nwhich is presented to new users, but apparently made no other attempt \nto draw attention to the change.\\16\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\16\\ See Response Letter of Knology 2.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    The level of detail in the disclosures also fell far short of the \nminimum that is necessary for customers to make an informed decision. \nFor example, CenturyTel sent an e-mail informing users only that it had \n``updated its Privacy Policy concerning Internet Access Services'' and \nprovided a web link to the updated policy.\\17\\ The policy in question \nstated only:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\17\\ Response Letter of CenturyTel 3. 18 Id. 3 (emphasis added)."

"","","dorgan","Senator Dorgan","    No mention is made at all of providing actual user data (let alone \nall of a user's packets) to third parties. Only a single mention of ads \nbeing ``based on those users' anonymous surfing behavior'' is offered \nin the first notice, and the second presents the service only as \nenhanced, ``targeted advertising for your convenience and benefit'' \nwithout mention of the methods involved to deliver said advertisements. \nIt's worth noting that these examples are not unique to CenturyTel or \neven unusual; rather, they are indicative of the level of detail \nprovided in many ISP notices. Such notices do not make clear to the \nuser what is actually being done with the data they send and receive \nover the Internet. None of the ISPs appears to have required that a \nuser take any affirmative action at all before having their data handed \nwholesale to a third party. Inaction or failure to read the notice was \nsimply treated as an `opt-in'.\n    It is important to note that nearly every ISP that responded \nmentioned that they run their own websites, and use traditional \ntracking methods such as cookies to observe and record the behavior of \ntheir customers on their sites, much like Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, and \nmany other web service providers do. Likewise, many ISPs also use what \nis called a ``DNS redirect,'' which, rather than returning an error to \na user's web browser when he or she types in an incorrect web address, \nredirects the user to another web page which may have related \nsuggestions, advertisements, or other information.\n    These non-DPI practices have privacy implications that overlap with \nthe ones being discussed today, but which are different in kind and \nscope. It is the difference between you writing down what I tell you on \nthe phone and my phone company recording my conversation with you \nbecause unlike my phone company, you cannot record what I've said on my \nphone calls to other people. Nonetheless, the privacy practices of and \npersonal information available to application providers raise their own \nserious questions of legal policy, and any regulatory regime we \nconsider must be comprehensive and attempt to ensure the protection of \nInternet users against privacy invasions from all such sources.\nV. Current Law\n    Independent analysis by the Center for Democracy and Technology \nsuggests that although it is far from clear, despite ISP claims,\\20\\ \npast experiments with DPI and behavioral advertising of the type \nengaged in by Knobbed may run afoul of existing law. Critically, \nhowever, some of the laws in question might not apply if the ISP \nengaged in this behavior internally, instead of delegating \nresponsibility to a third party.\\21\\ Thus, an ISP might legally be able \nto read and analyze all of its customers' communications as long as it \ndoes so itself--hardly an improvement in privacy.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\20\\ See Center for Democracy and Technology, An Overview of the \nFederal Wiretap Act, Electronic Communications Privacy Act, and State \nTwo-Party Consent Laws of Relevance to the Knobbed System and Other \nUses of Internet Traffic Content from ISPs for Behavioral Advertising, \n(July 8, 2008), available at http://www.cdt.org/privacy/\n    \\21\\ See id. at 6-9.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    It is extremely important to note that without apparent exception, \nevery ISP that responded to Chairman Markey's letter concluded that \nboth the tracking and opt-out mechanism were legal, or at the very \nleast, were ``not unlawful or impermissible.'' \\22\\ One ISP even went \nso far as to claim that it ``offered customers easy-to-use opt-out \nmechanisms as recommended by the FTC.'' \\23\\ However, even the ``opt-\nout'' method was questionable, as the act of opting out did not stop \nthe delivery to and monitoring by the third-party partner but only the \npresentation of targeted ads and stored profiles.\\24\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\22\\ Response Letter of CenturyTel 2-3 (Aug. 7, 2008). Cable One \ndoes describe their disclosures in their Acceptable Use Policies as \n``opt-in'' because the user must check and acceptance box, but this \ndoes not qualify as either an affirmative step specific to monitoring \nor a meaningful opportunity to deny consent, because the alternative is \nno Internet service at all. See Response Letter of Cable One 3 (Aug. 8, \n2008).\n    \\23\\ Response Letter of Charter Communications 2 (Aug. 8, 2008) \n(emphasis added).\n    \\24\\ Ryan Singel, Congressmen Ask Charter to Freeze Web Profiling \nPlan, Threat Level from Wired.com (May 16, 2008). See also Ryan Singel, \nCan Charter Broadband Customers Really Opt-Out of Spying? Maybe Not, \nWired (May 16, 2008).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Yet to date, no enforcement actions have been taken against a \npractice that is of significant concern to citizens and lawmakers \nalike. Regardless of whether or not the actions taken by ISPs are \ntechnically legal, the existing legal regime is clearly not effective \nat preventing such privacy violations. And if ISPs believe they can \nlegally and profitably engage in this behavior with only a minimal \neffort made to notify and protect users, they will continue to do so.\n    To the credit of the ISPs here today, several providers have made \ncommitments to ensuring that there is transparency, affirmative \nconsent, and ongoing control by customers. For example, Time-Warner's \ntestimony suggests control, transparency, disclosure, and safeguarding \npersonal information as principles on which to base a privacy \nframework. AT&T states that the company will not engage in behavioral \nadvertising without affirmative, advance action by the consumer that is \nbased on a clear explanation of how that information will be used. But \nwhile these are laudable principles and we applaud the carriers here \ntoday for their stated commitment to customer privacy, promises by \nindividual ISPs are not enough and do not obviate the need for a \ncomprehensive governmental policy.\n    Part of the reason for the current lack of enforcement can be \ntraced to ambiguity in the FCC's authority to protect the privacy of \nInternet users, despite the FCC's time-honored role in protecting the \nprivacy of communications as a whole. Congress has long recognized that \nproviders of communications services occupy an especially sensitive \nposition in society. As data conduits, communications services are \nuniquely positioned to track customers and collect information about \ntheir daily lives. The Communications Act, which created the FCC, \ncontains provisions designed to protect the privacy of telephone and \ncable customers. But those same protections have yet to be \nunambiguously extended to Internet customers. As a result, customers \ncannot be confident that their sensitive information is protected from \nunwanted intrusion. In a society where Internet services are \nincreasingly used to transmit personal and sensitive information, this \nis clearly problematic.\n    Section 222 of the Communications Act applies to the privacy of \ncustomer information collected by common carriers.\\25\\ The statute \nrecognizes that ``individually identifiable consumer proprietary \nnetwork information'' is created by, and critical to the functioning \nof, telecommunications services.\\26\\ However, the statute strictly \nlimits the use of that information to applications that handle tasks \nlike billing and the maintenance of network integrity.\\27\\ Carriers are \nallowed to provide aggregate consumer information to third parties, but \nthis information must have both ``individual customer identities and \ncharacteristics'' removed.\\28\\ Viewed holistically, this section \nmanifests a Congressional understanding that common carriers have \naccess to sensitive personal information, and that common carriers have \nlegitimate reasons to use that data. However, this understanding is \nbalanced by strict prohibitions against any non-essential use or the \ndisclosure of sensitive data.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\25\\ 47 U.S.C. \u0006 222.\n    \\26\\ See 47 U.S.C. \u0006 222(c)(1).\n    \\27\\ See 47 U.S.C. \u0006 222(d).\n    \\28\\ See 47 U.S.C. \u0006 222(c)(3), (h)(2).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Although many common carriers provide Internet services to \nconsumers,\\29\\ such Internet services are not covered under Section \n222.\\30\\ As a result, plain old telephone customers can be confident \nthat sensitive information contained in their phone records will be \nkept confidential, but they cannot enjoy the same level of confidence \nwhen it comes to sensitive information that Verizon might compile using \ntheir DSL Internet activity.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\29\\ See, e.g., Verizon, http://www.verizon.com/.\n    \\30\\ See National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X \nInternet Services, 545 U.S. 967 (2005).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Section 631 of the Communications Act also marks an attempt by \nCongress to protect the privacy of consumers, this time from cable \nsystem operators. Again, the statute recognizes the fact that operators \nwill need to collect and use some personally identifiable information \nin order to operate their systems. However, these operators are \nrequired to obtain written permission from consumers in order to \ncollect any personally identifiable information that is not crucial to \nthe operation of the system.\\31\\ Additionally, operators are required \nto obtain prior written or electronic consent before disclosing any \npersonally identifiable information.\\32\\ The statute does not impose \nthese same protections on aggregate data that does not identify a \nparticular customer,\\33\\ and allows an operator to disclose names and \naddresses of subscribers as long as that information is not tied to use \nor transactional information.\\34\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\31\\ See 47 U.S.C. \u0006 551(b).\n    \\32\\ See 47 U.S.C. \u0006 551(c)(1).\n    \\33\\ See 47 U.S.C. \u0006 551(a)(2)(A).\n    \\34\\ See 47 U.S.C. \u0006 551(c)(2).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    As with Section 222, Section 631 specifically protects sensitive \ninformation that network operators are uniquely positioned to collect. \nHowever, unlike Section 222, which applies to phone customers but not \nInternet service customers, Section 631 is written to apply to both \ncable television subscribers and cable Internet subscribers.\\35\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\35\\ See 47 U.S.C. \u0006 551(a)(2)(C)(ii).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Unfortunately, not all customers access the Internet by way of a \ncable system. In addition to unprotected DSL service, customers can \naccess the Internet via a fiber optic network, a satellite based \nservice, or by using one of many wireless Internet standards. Instead \nof relying on old categories that may protect some (but certainly not \nall) consumers, Congress must recognize that all Internet service \nproviders share the same privileged position of access to their users' \npersonal data. As a result, Congress should collectively protect \ncustomers with legislation that specifically addresses all Internet \nservice providers, rather than legislation that effectively forces \ncustomers to access the Internet via a single, protected pathway.\n    The time has come for a comprehensive regulatory structure that \nwill ensure that the privacy rights of all Internet users are \nprotected, and one that, like the Telecommunications Act of 1996, \n``expands very important privacy protections to individuals in their \nrelationships with these very large companies.'' \\36\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\36\\ Statement of Congressman Edward Markey, 142 Cong. Rec. H1145-\n06 (Feb. 1, 1996).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVI. Fixing the Law\n    Given the power of the technology and the scope of possible uses, \nit is critical that we establish industry guidelines and legal \nprotections for users. And while the use of personal data by \napplication providers is not the focus of our discussion today, as \ndiscussed above, any solution should strive to be comprehensive in \nscope and ensure that the basic principles of privacy protection are \napplied across the entire Internet ecosystem. These protections should \nmeet three major goals that parallel the privacy inquiries described \nabove:"

"","","dorgan","Senator Dorgan","  <bullet> They must ensure that the amount and type of data collected \n        is narrowly tailored to the proposed use, and that the data is \n        not kept or disseminated to third parties past what is \n        necessary to that use."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","dorgan","Senator Dorgan","  <bullet> They must ensure that customers have access to and actually \n        receive adequate information about the proposed use, and have \n        affirmatively and actively consented to any practices which \n        could violate customers' expectations of privacy.\\37\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\37\\ The FCC has already presented us with an example of how \nCommission action and ISP disclosures can be used to help protect \nInternet users from privacy invasions and impermissible network \nmanagement practices. In its order finding that Comcast's interference \nwith customer traffic was not reasonable network management, the \nCommission ordered Comcast to fully disclose the details of its past \nand planned practices, including use of DPI.

Conclusion\n    I would like to thank the Committee again for giving me the \nopportunity to testify today. Public Knowledge is eager to work with \nthe Committee to craft comprehensive privacy legislation that will \nprotect Internet users. I look forward to your questions."
break,break,break,break,break
"dorgan","Senator Dorgan","dorgan","Senator Dorgan","    Ms. Sohn, thank you for your testimony.\n    Why do we not start with where you concluded on deep packet \ninspection? I know that our colleagues in the House had sent \nquestionnaires to Internet service providers and have received \nsome responses. How extensive do you think is this tactic of \ndeep packet inspection?\n    Ms. Sohn. Well, it was more extensive than it is now. \nBecause of the scrutiny over on the House side and also over \nhere, several of the ISPs that were using deep packet \ninspection have ceased using deep packet inspection. There was \nsuch an outcry. However, some are still using deep packet \ninspection.\n    And as I said before, a number of those--actually all of \nthe providers that were using deep packet inspection who \nresponded to the House said that they believed that they were \nfully acting within the law and that what they did to protect \nconsumers was adequate. And speaking to some of the folks--I \nwill let them speak for themselves--on my right, I know some of \nthem are considering using DPI as well, albeit with the \nprotections that they have outlined today."
"dorgan","Senator Dorgan","dorgan","Senator Dorgan","    Is there a beneficial use of deep packet \ninspection, for example, attempting to determine who is out \nthere that is providing viruses? So is deep packet inspection a \nprocess that in some cases can be beneficial?\n    Ms. Sohn. Absolutely. Public Knowledge has been saying in \nthe 7 years of its existence, that you do not outlaw \ntechnology. You outlaw bad uses of technology, and DPI, as you \nstated, can be used for lawful and very beneficial purposes."
"dorgan","Senator Dorgan","dorgan","Senator Dorgan","    But the testimony and knowledge we have, \nfor example, of NebuAd and others says that the purpose of deep \npacket inspection is to track people's behavior in a wide range \nof areas and then profile and do targeted advertising to that \nprofile, which is done, I assume, largely without the knowledge \nof the user, which is very troublesome.\n    Ms. Attwood, you indicated to me that the fact that the \nSenate and the House are beginning to evaluate these things was \nhelpful to your company because these are relatively new issues \nand it really caused your company to be thinking what kind of \npolicies do we employ, how do we go through this and develop \npolicies internally. And I think that is commendable.\n    The question I think for the three providers here is what \nkind of information do you collect at this point. What kind of \nmovements do you track and for what purpose?\n    Ms. Attwood. Well, it is a great question. I guess I would \nelaborate. Here we are talking about behavioral advertising."
"dorgan","Senator Dorgan","dorgan","Senator Dorgan","    Right.\n    Ms. Attwood. And in that context, we are not engaged in \nthat practice today. And we commend you and this Committee and \nthe attention and the effort to look at the way in which \ncollection of material has affected or prompted our consumers \nto identify what they are concerned about.\n    That allows us to actually look as we enter into these \nphases to say can we use privacy as a design element. Rather \nthan as a regulatory requirement or as something after the fact \nthat we have to look at, let us look and say our products and \nservices--privacy will be by design. And that is what this \ndialogue allows us to do. It allows us to as an industry \ngalvanize around how we can construct the right framework so \nthat we can bring the benefits of both the advantages of an \nadvertising-supported model, which is really an innovation in \nthe Internet area, as well as the capabilities of protecting \nthe privacy of our customers.\n    So we have millions of customers, and therefore we have \nlots of information that we use to improve the services and \nproducts of our customers. There is a lot of value that can be \ncreated and innovation that can be created in offering \nadditional targeted advertising, as well as additional value \npropositions to the customer. We think that is something today \nthat has proved itself, whether it is affinity cards or whether \nit is in some things that you already see. Those are areas \nwhere we are hopeful we can help innovate, as long as we \nconsider privacy by design."
"dorgan","Senator Dorgan","dorgan","Senator Dorgan","    As a consumer and an Internet user, I see \nthe value of targeted advertising because if I am on the \nInternet wanting perhaps buy a pair of shoes and then I see \ntargeted advertising coming at me advertising certain kinds of \nshoes, perhaps even that same brand, I understand that someone \nsaw I was looking at shoes, and so they were trying to provide \nadditional advertising about shoes. In many ways that is \nuseful, perhaps in some cases annoying, but in many other cases \nuseful.\n    But the other side of this is that an Internet service \nprovider would have a substantial body of knowledge. Let us \nassume that my two colleagues, Senator Klobuchar and Senator \nThune, are customers of the same provider. You would have a \nsubstantial amount of information about each of them, what they \nhave done, what their travels have been on the Internet, where \nthey have visited, and so on. And that could have enormous \nfinancial value to a company. And someone comes to your company \nand says, you know what? That information you are sitting on \nhas great, great value. We will pay a lot of money for it. So \nthat is where the advertising model on the Internet confronts \nthe issue of privacy that is very, very important.\n    So I appreciate the testimony today. I think all three of \nyou have said that your companies have had to sink their teeth \ninto this question of how do you deal with the privacy issue. \nYou have all talked, I think, about the opt-in strategy doing \nso in a manner that has a customer that is fully informed.\n    I have seen a number of opt-in strategies that I think, Mr. \nTauke, you mentioned. People do not have the foggiest idea \nwhether they have opted in or opted out. They have simply \npushed the ``OK'' button with the cursor, and so there they \nare.\n    This is a really interesting set of issues. I did indicate \nthat if somebody followed you into a mall with a clipboard and \ntraced everything you not just bought or store you visited, but \nevery single item you looked at, you have great angst about \nthat. Who on earth is doing this? And yet, that potential \nexists. And so that is why we have to try to deal with this \ntension between constructive advertising models on the Internet \nand the right to privacy.\n    Senator Klobuchar is next."

"","","dorgan","Senator Dorgan","    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much, Chairman Dorgan. \nThank you for having this hearing. Thank you to our witnesses.\n    At the last hearing on this, I expressed my views that \nAmericans have a love-hate relationship with advertising on the \nInternet. We want to see some of it, and then some of it we do \nnot want.\n    I made the mistake, Mr. Chair, of using the example at the \nlast hearing of how I liked to see ads pop up for deals on \nclothes, but I do not like it when my daughter who is 13 sees \nads for American Girls. And as a result, I would just like the \nrecord to reflect, I got several letters from defenders of \nAmerican Girl dolls. It was in the Los Angeles Times--my quote. \nAnd I just want the record to reflect that I have nothing \nagainst the American Girl dolls, including Kirsten, Molly, \nKaya, and Kit Kittredge, which movie I just saw. So if you \ncould just make that clear."
"dorgan","Senator Dorgan","dorgan","Senator Dorgan","    Well, the permanent record will reflect----"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","","","    [Laughter.]\n    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much.\n    I actually just had some questions looking at your \ntestimony and thinking about what we talked about last time. \nYou know how when you have your credit record, you are able to \ngo back and clear it up and see what information is on there. \nDo you think you should have the same ability to do that as a \nconsumer with any information that might be on there on your \nshopping record or the information on you on the Internet? I do \nnot know who wants to take that.\n    Ms. Attwood. I am happy to address that. I think that is \none of the issues that would be interesting to develop, the \nquestion of whether the customer not only can control the \ninformation that is collected, but also can identify and see \nwhat they look like online. And even more to your point--and I \ndo not want letters either, although I do not think I would get \nthem from American Girl.\n    Senator Klobuchar. These were just consumers for American \nGirl, not the company.\n    Ms. Attwood. Maybe ultimately down the line you would be \nable to have some flexibility in identifying what \nadvertisements you want to see and what you do not want to see. \nSo those could be age-specific. Those could be related to your \nhousehold, a particular interest in your household.\n    So the concept of customer control, the concept of using \nthe capabilities and enhancements of the technology to help \ncustomize that experience is something of an exciting prospect \nso long as we protect and really embrace the notion of privacy.\n    Senator Klobuchar. Mr. Stern?\n    Mr. Stern. Thank you, Senator.\n    If I may just add, not only does customer consent allow the \nconsumer to opt in, if they want to have online advertising be \ntargeted, but they can also opt out. And that gives them a \nunique ability to do something that they cannot do with their \ncredit report, which is to wipe the slate clean. And so we \nthink that that is actually an important part of this, giving \ncustomers the ability to make a decision and later change their \nmind.\n    Senator Klobuchar. Very good. And the technology is \navailable to do that?\n    Mr. Stern. Yes, it is.\n    Senator Klobuchar. If we were to put together some \nlegislation at some point--and I know all three of you would \nrather have it be self-regulating, but if Federal privacy \nregulation is considered in Congress, what would you think the \nkey would be to this potential legislation? What do you think \nshould be in that? Are there any models you would look at like \nthe European data privacy law, or what would you look at to do \nthat? Mr. Tauke?\n    Mr. Tauke. Well, Senator, first of all, you are right. At \nthis juncture, we are not prepared to embrace legislation. We \nactually think that there are some models on the books already \nthat could be useful. I mentioned in my testimony the \nadvertising industry's model where the FTC is the enforcing \nagency.\n    One of the reasons why we are a little unsure about \nlegislation at this juncture is because this technology is \ndeveloping so rapidly, and there are different technologies \nthat are being used to do different things. As I think all of \nus have alluded to in one way or another, the technology is not \nin and of itself bad. The technology can do terrific things in \norder to enhance online experiences. It is how it is handled \nand what the consumer role is.\n    So having said that, with legislation I believe the notion \nof meaningful consent and the consumer in charge of their \nonline experience are the two key elements. Exactly how that \ntranslates into the technology of today and the technology and \npractices of tomorrow is a little uncertain yet. That is why I \nthink if the industry could, in a sense, help establish some \nbest practices ourselves, try to keep up to date with that \nstuff, get all the players involved, because the consumer does \nnot care who is tracking--you know, it is the same impact no \nmatter who is doing it--if we could do that and then that might \ninform the Committee too of what we are doing and where gaps \nmay be and if you should step forward with some additional \nlegislation.\n    Senator Klobuchar. Do you think competition could push, \nthough, some of your fellow competitors not to keep up with \nthose regulations?\n    Mr. Tauke. Competition works both ways on this issue, \nSenator. I mean, I think what we have found in our history on \nsome of these issues is being on the side of the consumer and \nprivacy is not a bad deal. We have had some fairly highly \npublicized lawsuits over the last few years trying to protect \nour consumers' privacy, and we think that benefited us in the \nmarketplace.\n    When we have dealt with issues like--I remember a couple \ndecades ago now, I guess, when we were dealing with caller ID. \nIn other words, there were a lot of fits and starts with caller \nID. Initially it was thought to be a great privacy protector \nbecause you could see who is calling you. Then, of course, \nthere was concern that, oh, now the estranged husband knows \nsomething about who is calling the wife and various other \nthings that happened. And so there was concern from a domestic \nviolence perspective and so on. Then we had blocking that came \ninto play and various other things happened with the \ntechnology.\n    So we evolved to the place today I think where most \nconsumers really like the technology, the information it \nprovides. They know how to protect themselves if they do not \nwant their number following their call.\n    So I think it is the same thing here. We have to, over \ntime, figure out how to do this the right way.\n    But I think it is in our company's interest to be on the \nside of privacy. I think that is a marketing advantage. I think \nthat for the industry as a whole, it is essential that we get \nthere. The worst thing for our industry is the consumers are \nafraid to use the Internet.\n    Senator Klobuchar. And I would agree with you, especially \nfrom larger, mainstream companies that do not want to be tarred \nwith having not protected privacy rights. But not all the \ncompanies in the game might care about that as much. And that \nis why I am looking at some rules that could maybe protect your \nown industry if you had some rules that you already believe are \nin your best interest that could protect the consumers from \nother companies which might not share your interests in \nprotecting privacy as a marketing and as a good thing to do as \na company.\n    Ms. Attwood. Yes. I would like to underscore that because \nnot all folks in this space have consumers that they answer to. \nWe fully agree with Verizon's position about this being a \nmarketing advantage. AT&T views that absolutely as a great \nopportunity here. But right now there is behavioral targeting \nin the online environment, and it is by web actors who do not \nhave direct customers to answer to.\n    The beauty of an advertising-supported model is that it is \nfree. The disadvantage is that your customer is your \nadvertising industry. It is not retail. It is not our \ncustomers. So while I think that there is a direct advantage \nthat we have to our customers, I think we would, at AT&T, say \nanother key element to any legislative proposal would be that \nit apply to all actors because that is really the only way. I \nmean, we talk a lot about from a competitive point of view, and \nclearly that is of interest to AT&T.\n    But I would say from a customer confusion question, without \nreally addressing this issue holistically, when the customer \nturns on the computer and goes to a web page and on that web \npage there is advertising and on that advertising, that \ncustomer has indicated to AT&T that they do not want to be \ntracked, I cannot do anything to protect that customer from \nbeing tracked by other entities that are, in fact, appearing in \nthat advertising space.\n    So until we address this holistically, even efforts from \ncompanies such as ours suggesting that there ought to be \ncontrol and ought to be affirmative selection by the customer \ncannot be implemented fully, and the customer can be confused.\n    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you."
"dorgan","Senator Dorgan","dorgan","Senator Dorgan","    We had other companies testifying at the \nfirst hearing, and at that point we did not have the Internet \nservice providers, which is why we wanted to have Internet \nservice providers at this hearing.

"thune","Senator Thune","dorgan","Senator Dorgan","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    And that was an interesting hearing, and this is an issue \nthat is getting a lot of attention, as you would expect. And I \ndo not think there is any question that online advertising is \nthe fuel for this economic engine that is really driving the \nworld right now. It has resulted in substantial access to free \ncontent for people on the worldwide Web.\n    But I do want to pick up on the previous discussion here \nbecause I think, Mr. Tauke, you had mentioned in your remarks \nthat the industry is working to develop self-regulating privacy \nstandards for online advertising. And to get back to Ms. \nAttwood's point, one entity cannot do this. There has got to be \nsome sort of an agreement, I think, within the industry.\n    So I guess my question is, what is the time line for those \nstandards? Who is participating in developing those standards? \nWhat are those standards going to look like? And will you keep \nus updated as you progress down that road?\n    Mr. Tauke. First, we have signed some nondisclosure \nagreements with some other companies that would not permit me \nto today publicly disclose who all the players are. But I think \nit is fair to say that there are ISPs, there are \nrepresentatives of other online types of activities. So I think \nwe are seeing people from all parts of the online sector, the \nsearch engines, the browsers, and so on, who are interested in \nparticipating in this kind of thing.\n    We also have talked to and engaged with some in the \nadvertising industry who also have an interest.\n    I cannot tell you we will get there, but I am encouraged by \nthe progress so far. And I think it is feasible that in over a \nmatter of a few months we would be able to get a pretty strong \ngroup of players in the industry to move forward with best \npractices.\n    Then the question becomes how do you enforce those. First, \nthere is a lot to be said for shining the light of day on a lot \nof practices, and if industry is focused on doing that, it is \nable to do that, and force change. That happened with this \nCommittee. This Committee held a hearing, and as the witnesses \nhave pointed out, people stopped their behavior because the \nlight of day was shined upon it. That is what an industry group \ncan do.\n    Second, as we have alluded to earlier, the Federal Trade \nCommission also has jurisdiction in this area, has indicated it \nintends to assert jurisdiction, and if informed by good \nindustry practices and standards, then I think the FTC would \nhave greater ability to act appropriately."
"thune","Senator Thune","thune","Senator Thune","    Do you have a time line for when all this \nmight----\n    Mr. Tauke. What I would like to say to you is it will all \nhappen in 2 months. I do not know that I can say that. I think \nthis is a process. You are familiar with that, of course, in \nthe Senate. It is a process. I think we have made good \nprogress. I think as you have heard this morning, several \ncompanies are endorsing very similar principles here. So I \nthink that there is a consensus developing. And I hope by the \nend of the year, certainly by the time you come back, that we \ncan report back to you and give you progress on where we are. I \nthink we will have something fairly good to say."
"thune","Senator Thune","thune","Senator Thune","    That would be really helpful because I think \nthat that is a preferable solution to having us try and \nlegislate something in this area. But it has to be at least, I \nthink, somewhat comprehensive in terms of the scope of those \nfrom industry who are participating in order to make it \neffective. So I would encourage you as you continue down that \ntrack.\n    And I would direct this, I guess, to any of our panelists. \nBut you talk about sensitive information deserving a greater \ndegree of protection than regular online uses. And I guess the \nquestion would be, what is considered sensitive personal \ninformation? Is that a health record? Is that a credit card \nhistory, e-mails? What qualifies in your judgment in that \ncategory of sensitive information?\n    Mr. Stern. Senator, all of those could count as sensitive \ninformation. Certainly medical information is sensitive. And we \nbelieve that this opt-in framework ensures that we will protect \nthose forms of sensitive information.\n    We also think that there are certain types of information--\nand medical information may be one of those--that merits a \ndialogue between policymakers and participants in industry that \nwould put even more stringent controls around certain types of \ninformation, including making it possibly entirely off limits \nfor activities like targeted online advertising.\n    Ms. Sohn. I think it is critical that it is the Internet \nuser who makes that choice as to what is sensitive. Right now \nwith deep packet inspection, sometimes it is a third party or \nthe NebuAd that is deciding what is sensitive and not. As you \npoint out, there is not a commonly understood definition of \nwhat sensitive is. So that is, to me, a critical part of \nputting control back in the Internet users' hands. They decide \nwhat is sensitive as opposed to a third party with whom they \nare not even contracting.\n    Mr. Tauke. Let me just say first this is a tough area. It \nis hard to define exactly what the sensitive information is and \nprecisely how you handle it.\n    So, for example, we all agree, I think, that medical \nrecords would be sensitive information. Yet, I get my \nprescriptions online. I do not know about the rest of you. And \nI want my online pharmacist to keep track of what I have. I am \nhappy when they send me a notice saying, you know, it is time \nto renew your prescription. If I would get another prescription \nthat interacted inappropriately with what I have today, I would \nhope that they would notify me and tell me that. So that means \nwe are asking them, on the one hand, to keep track of some of \nthese things. On the other hand, this is certainly information \nthat most of us would say should not be tracked.\n    So there are some fine lines here to draw. It is tough, but \nI think that this is part of what we hope we can make progress \non in an industry process.\n    Ms. Attwood. I would also underscore what Gigi said, which \nis absolutely creating tools to enable our users to be able to \nindividually assess what is sensitive will be a critical thing, \nagain, another potentially wonderful advance that we could use \nthe technology to actually empower the customer to orient \nthemselves around what is sensitive.\n    The last thing that the provider wants to do is make that \njudgment. I can tell you whether Government makes it or the \nuser makes it, the last thing that we want to do is try to make \nsome judgment as to what is important to our customers when it \ncomes to sensitive information."
"thune","Senator Thune","thune","Senator Thune","    Mr. Chairman, I have one more question. My \ntime is expired."
"dorgan","Senator Dorgan","thune","Senator Thune","    Why don't you proceed?"
"thune","Senator Thune","dorgan","Senator Dorgan","    OK. I would like to have you describe--Mr. \nStern, you mentioned the difference between relevant online \nadvertising and targeted online advertising. Could you \nelaborate on the difference between those two, and from your \nperspective, are those different types of targeted online \nadvertising that are more problematic for consumer privacy?\n    Mr. Stern. Ads can be relevant for a number of reasons, \nSenator. For example, when customers come to a Website and they \ngo to the sports page of that Website and then they see \nadvertisements for team memorabilia, that context was used in \norder to make the ad relevant. However, if the relevance is \nbased on the customer's behavior on other unrelated Websites, \nthen we would consider that targeted online advertising, the \ntype of advertising that should be governed under the four \nprinciples that we talked about earlier, informed consent, plus \nsafeguarding consumer privacy, and value."

"wicker","Senator Wicker","dorgan","Senator Dorgan","    Thank you, Chairman Dorgan, for having this \nfollow up hearing.\n    You know, I was sitting here thinking John Thune came to \nthe House of Representatives in 1996. I got here in 1994. We \nwere talking about this thing called the worldwide Web. If we \nhad a little time during the orientation, we could go to a room \nand surf the worldwide Web. And to think how far this industry \nhas come in 12 or 14 short years is just breathtaking.\n    I pay my bills. I check my balance. I make purchases. And \nit is the engine that is largely driving the international \neconomy, and we want to be able to facilitate that for the \neconomy and for job creation and for consumers' convenience.\n    So I appreciate the fact that there seems to be a feeling \nthat the Congress should defer perhaps and see if these issues \nof privacy and behavioral advertising can be worked out among \nthe participants rather than as a result of legislation.\n    I will begin with Mr. Tauke. Maybe within 2 months, we \nmight have an agreement announced among the providers. How will \nthey compare to the proposed behavioral advertising guidelines \nof the FTC?\n    Mr. Tauke. I think all of the companies that are engaged in \ndiscussion on this issue are well aware of the FTC's \nprinciples. And of course, you never know the outcome of a \ndiscussion until it is completed. But I think what the FTC laid \nout has been very helpful and informative, and in turn, we \nwould hope what the industry could come up with would also be \nhelpful and informative to the FTC."
"wicker","Senator Wicker","wicker","Senator Wicker","    OK. Other panelists?\n    Mr. Stern. Senator, we think the principles that we have \nproposed are very similar to what was laid out by the FTC, but \nthey actually go one step further in protecting consumer \nprivacy. And that is that we are seeking affirmative customer \nconsent for the use of any type of information for the purposes \nof targeted online advertising, not just personally \nidentifiable information."
"wicker","Senator Wicker","wicker","Senator Wicker","    And would you explain what you mean by that \nto a layman?\n    Mr. Stern. Absolutely. When you held your testimony in July \nand met with NebuAd, they talked about the ability that they \nhad with their technology to anonymize the data that they \nreceived so that they would track the customer's behavior, but \nit could not be attributed to any individual. It would be used \nto deliver relevant ads to that individual while they browsed, \nbut they could not tie it back to a person. They could not tell \nthat that browsing behavior was your browsing behavior, \nalthough they could change your browsing experience based on \nthe information.\n    What we are proposing is that we would not even do what \nNebuAd talked about, absent affirmative customer consent. In \nother words, we would not use your information whether or not \nwe could attribute it to you personally to deliver targeted \nonline advertising to you."
"wicker","Senator Wicker","wicker","Senator Wicker","    I see.\n    Other members of the panel?\n    Ms. Attwood. Well, I would just say I think that the FTC \nprocess has greatly informed our industry discussions. They \nwere able to, along with great work that has been done in the \nprivacy consumer community by Ms. Sohn's group, by CDT, others \nthat have helped shed light on the issue, helped identify the \npractices that are most concerning to consumers, and have \nthrough the imprimatur of the FTC and its process created \nimportance, as has this Committee, creating the incentive for \nthe industry to come together to talk, to make sure that we \nunderstand how we can, in fact, achieve ultimately a greater \nsense of privacy assurance for consumers so that they use our \nservices and use the Internet even more. I think that there is \nno question that the FTC process has been quite involved in the \ndevelopment of that.\n    Ms. Sohn. Can I be the skunk at the self-regulatory party? \nBecause----"
"wicker","Senator Wicker","wicker","Senator Wicker","    That would be a lot of fun.\n    Ms. Sohn. I want to make two points.\n    Number one is to address something that Senator Klobuchar \nsaid about competition. The problem is that, at least in \nbroadband, there is not that much competition. This is \nsomething my organization has talked about for a long, long \ntime. And a lot of the ISPs that were using deep packet \ninspection and NebuAd were not subject to great competition. A \nlot of them were rural ISPs. So the notion that there is going \nto be this competitive pressure, I'm dubious.\n    The second thing--and this is the point that I discussed in \nmy oral testimony but discuss in more detail in my written \ntestimony--is that the Communications Act already does cover \nsome ISPs. There is a lot of talk about a level playing field, \nbut right now cable Internet services are covered by stricter \nprivacy regulation than broadband telephone information ISP \nservices. So there is already in the law gaps where Mr. Tauke's \ncompany is being treated differently than a Comcast. So I do \nthink that at a minimum you need to amend the Communications \nAct to fix those gaps because right now you do not have a level \nplaying field between broadband ISPs."
"wicker","Senator Wicker","wicker","Senator Wicker","    Response?\n    Mr. Tauke. Part of that highlights the point. Yes, there \nare all kinds of rules that apply to all different companies \ndifferently. If you guys could take on the Communications Act \nand level the playing field, most of us would applaud heartily. \nBut rewriting that act--it has been a long process and it is \nvery hard to get anything to fruition when you take on that \nmajor a task.\n    So we are not saying that we are opposed to the Committee \naddressing the issue, but what you are doing here, having a \nhearing, forcing industry to address the issue is helpful. We \nhave the FTC that has some authority already. We have an \nindustry that I think wants to get its act together. It is in \nour own interest to clean up the act. Right? So I think that \ncan help.\n    If all that should happen, if the Senate--God bless you if \nyou go forward and do your thing. That is terrific. But in the \nmeanwhile, I think there is a need for this other activity to \ngo on. That will inform what you do. It may turn out this is \nnot such a big issue, or it may turn out there are other \nproblems that arise as this goes on. But we ought to go forward \nwith the self-regulatory approach, try to use what is there, \nand that will help inform you, I think, what the challenges are \nand where we may need additional legislation."
"wicker","Senator Wicker","wicker","Senator Wicker","    Thank you."
"dorgan","Senator Dorgan","wicker","Senator Wicker","    Senator Wicker, thank you.\n    This issue of self-regulation--I think the process that is \nongoing is very valuable. But in the ultimate, self-regulation \nworks if there is, number one, adequate criteria established, \nand number two, if it is enforceable. And one of my concerns is \nthat what is happening now and what will happen in the future \nwith respect to Internet advertising is various entities, \ncontent providers, Internet service providers, and others, have \ninformation that is going to become increasingly valuable, and \nit is tempting product to sell to someone who would like to \npurchase it. And so the question is under what conditions does \nthat happen.\n    I want to come back to this question. Mr. Stern, you talked \nabout when NebuAd appeared before this Committee and the \nanonymizing of information. It seems to me, however, that if \nNebuAd gathers all of this information and develops the \nstrategies for targeted advertising and profiling, that if they \nare able to deliver that advertisement back to the Internet \naddress, it is really not anonymous, is it?\n    Mr. Stern. Senator, there is a separation between the \ninformation that NebuAd has, which is a profile attached to an \nanonymous identifier, and the information that the ISP has, \nwhich is the connection between that anonymous identifier and \nthe individual. As a consequence, there is--and I am not an \nexpert on NebuAd's technology, given that we have not engaged \nin targeted online advertising and we have not done any sort of \na deal with NebuAd or anyone like that--but there is, in fact, \na set of technologies that are used in that approach to protect \nthe customer's identity and anonymity."
"dorgan","Senator Dorgan","dorgan","Senator Dorgan","    But there has to be a string somewhere from \nthe information gathered and then ultimately delivered to the \nInternet address of the person whose tendencies on the Internet \nhave been profiled. I mean, this reminds me of the discussion I \nsat in last night for 2 hours on the financial rescue issue, \nthe discussion about firewalls that exist. It turns out the \nfirewalls were not so fireproof.\n    Mr. Stern. That is correct, Senator. There is no perfect \ntechnology here.\n    But the principles that we have outlined ensure that \ntargeted online advertising would only take place if consumers \naffirmatively consent after being informed of how their \ninformation will be used. As a consequence, we think that the \nharm that you have raised is one that customers will be able to \nevaluate and weigh against the benefits that they will enjoy by \nbeing able to see more relevant ads."
"dorgan","Senator Dorgan","dorgan","Senator Dorgan","    It is interesting. I was just looking at a \nreport that was released this morning. The information was \nprovided me last evening of what was to be released this \nmorning. It is a poll released today by Consumer Reports' \nNational Research Center, and it has a lot of interesting \ninformation in it. There is a lot of misinformation out there \nand a great deal of lack of information.\n    Consumers are aware that information about their surfing \nhabits, that is, movements on the Web, is being collected \nonline. And here is what they believe.\n    Sixty-one percent of consumers are confident that what they \ndo online is private and not shared without their permission. \nThat is what people now believe.\n    Fifty-seven percent believe that companies must identify \nthemselves and indicate why they are collecting data and \nwhether they intend to share it with other organizations.\n    Forty-eight percent believe that their consent is now \nrequired for companies to use personal information they collect \nfrom online activities.\n    Forty-three percent believe a court order is now required \nto monitor activities online.\n    I only describe that to you because this is just released \nthis morning. What it does show is while people, I think almost \nall of us would understand, are very concerned about privacy, \nthey have very little understanding about what exists or what \nmight not exist to create fences or gates or protections for \ntheir online privacy.\n    I think that the work that our colleagues in the House have \ndone with their data gathering and hearings, the work that we \nhave done, and the work that the FTC is now doing and the \nefforts by people in your industry to come together and develop \napproaches--again, I think in many ways these hearings kind of \nprovoke and require people to be thinking what are we doing and \nhow does it relate to what our responsibilities are and what \nthe law is. I think all of this is constructive for us, as we \nmove down the road here, to understand what is necessary. Is \nthis something that can be self-regulated with enforcement \ncapabilities, or will there need to be, both at the FTC and \nalso will there need to be here in the Congress, some \nlegislative guidelines developed that will inform us as we move \nforward.\n    I do not think any of us fully know the answer to that, but \nwe are now learning a great deal more than we knew, which I \nthink is progress.\n    I want to thank the three Internet service providers for \nmaking themselves available for this hearing. Your testimony, I \nthink, is instructive for us.\n    Ms. Sohn, the title of your organization is Public \nKnowledge, which is pretty all-encompassing I was thinking, as \nI read that last evening. So we thank you for providing public \nknowledge about these issues from your perspective, which I \nthink is also very valuable to this Committee.\n    This hearing is adjourned."
