"baucus","Senator Baucus","","","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I \nheard your request that members keep their remarks to, I think \nit was, 3 minutes. I might say that I will not be here very \nmuch during the day. The ICET conference is going on and I will \nnot be able to ask very many questions of the panelists. So, \nwith your indulgence, I have a few more than three minutes in \nmy opening statement.\n    The Chairman. Please proceed."
"baucus","Senator Baucus","baucus","Senator Baucus","    Mr. Chairman, one of the earliest \ncontroversies facing the newly independent United States of \nAmerica involved the taxing power of the Federal Government. \nAfter all, unjust taxes were the chief causes of the war for \nindependence.\n    But our founding fathers had fresh memories of raising an \narmy and running and embattled government mostly on borrowed \nfunds. They knew they would need revenue to provide for the \ncommon good. So, in an act passed by the very first Congress, \nwe gave the central government the power to collect tariffs and \ntaxes, so long as they were fair and uniform.\n    During the past couple of months in every household across \nthe country, Americans went through an annual rite. They sat \ndown at the kitchen table, pulled all of their financial \nrecords together, and figured out what they owed the \ngovernment. Nobody likes doing their taxes and they probably \ndislike paying them even more. Yet the vast majority do it, and \nthey do it honestly.\n    Americans realize they have a bargain with their country \nwhich is their duty to uphold: they pay their taxes so that \ntheir money, when pooled together with the money contributed by \nall their friends, neighbors, and fellow citizens, is used \nwisely for the common good.\n    Americans expect their money to defend their families from \nhostile nations, to educate their children, to provide for a \nclean and healthful environment, to improve their highways, to \nhelp keep them healthy, to help provide for them in their old \nage and to give a helping hand to those going through hard \ntimes. In short, Americans expect their money to be used to pay \nfor all of the things that help make this Nation great.\n    In return, though, the American people want their \ngovernment to do two things. First, the American people want \ntheir government to treat them with respect and dignity as the \nrevenue is collected. They expect to have their privacy \nrespected and to be treated fairly.\n    Second, Americans expect that everyone else who enjoys the \nbenefits that taxes pay for will shoulder their share of the \nburden as well, that their neighbor down the street is not \nhiding part of his income and thus avoiding paying his fair \nshare of the tax, that everyone is filing returns and the \namounts claimed on those returns are accurate and true.\n    Mr. Chairman, I truly believe the American people have the \nright to have both of these expectations met. I believe we here \nin the Senate shoulder a great deal of the responsibility for \nmaking sure of it.\n    We were placed on this committee because, presumably, we \nunderstand the need for revenue to keep this country moving. We \nalso understand the grave responsibility that goes along with \nthe power to tax. After all, John Marshall said, ``The power to \ntax involves the power to destroy.''\n    It is our duty as members of this committee to make sure \nthis country does not use its power in that fashion. How do we \ndo that? We must stay above partisan politics and petty \nsquabbles. We must make sure our laws reflect good public \npolicy and that the Tax Code is used for the benefit of the \nAmerican people.\n    That is why I have watched the process we have gone through \nin anticipation of these hearings with a measure of personal \nregret and disappointment. I do not believe these hearings are \nbalanced. I believe they fail to rise above party politics. I \ndo not believe they will ultimately benefit the American \npeople.\n    Mr. Chairman, if you look at ``Webster's New World \nDictionary,'' under the word oversight you will find it \ndescribed as ``vigilant supervision.'' As members of the Senate \nFinance Committee, we must be vigilant that individual \ntaxpayers are being treated right by the Internal Revenue \nService.\n    However, it is every bit as important that we are vigilant \nto make sure that taxpayers are treated fairly. Let me make it \nclear, I do not object to investigating the IRS to make sure it \nis operating correctly and treating taxpayers right. We must, \nand we should, do so. That is part of our responsibility.\n    But I also believe we have a responsibility to look at the \nwhole picture, not just place a spotlight on the issues that \ngive political advantage to one party or another.\n    How can we spend 4 days talking about a handful of cases \nthat the IRS might or might not have mishandled yet not spend a \nsingle minute talking about how some Americans are flouting the \ntax laws? Our entire system of collecting revenue would unravel \nif taxpayers stopped paying their fair share because they \nbelieved everyone else is cheating.\n    Estimates of tax avoidance are soaring, with many believing \nthe numbers could reach $100 billion per year. How can we \nignore this issue or ignore the dangers that IRS employees face \nevery day as they try to do the job we have hired them to do?\n    Mr. Chairman, we have a new Commissioner of the IRS, Mr. \nCharles Rossotti. He is an honorable man and a good public \nservant. We have given him a mighty challenge, to reform an \nagency that has resisted reform in the past. He has asked us \nfor a few simple tools to make the IRS work better: changes in \npersonnel rules so he can put a good working team in place; the \nability to reorganize the agency so he can eliminate layers of \nduplication.\n    Most of these provisions are included in the IRS \nrestructuring bill that the House passed 6 months ago by a vote \nof 426 to 4. That bill still awaits action by the full Senate.\n    Mr. Chairman, if we are going to spend our time on these \nhearings I wish that they could be balanced. But since that \napparently is not possible, I urge you to move quickly to pass \na good IRS restructuring bill through this Senate.\n    Passing a solid restructuring bill will do more to get the \nIRS on track than 100 of these hearings where we sit, posture, \npontificate, and play politics. It is our responsibility as \nmembers of this committee, and more importantly it is our \nresponsibility to the American people.\n    Thank you.\n    The Chairman. Well, thank you, Senator Baucus. I would \npoint out that we expect the legislation to come up, hopefully, \nnext week. To expedite its consideration, I am hopeful that we \nare able to reach some kind of unanimous agreement.\n    I do want to point out that, insofar as these hearings are \nconcerned, many of the examples that are cited happened under \nRepublican administrations as well as Democratic, so there is \nno partisanship in our pursuit of the facts.\n    I would point out that these hearings will deal, in part, \nwith the problem of compliance. But I think the important thing \nis to get on with the job.\n    The Chairman. Senator Grassley?"

"","","baucus","Senator Baucus","    Senator Grassley. Mr. Chairman, I would caution all my \ncolleagues to forget about points of partisanship or forget \nabout the issue of balance. We heard those same statements made \nthe first day of our hearings last September, and, after that \nfirst 24 hours, the things that were laid out were so bad to \ndemonstrate how things are so wrong in the department, that for \nthose hearings and the hearings last February there was never a \ncharge of partisanship after that first day.\n    I think that we also want to remember that when it comes to \nthe IRS trying to bring changes on their own, that through the \nevolution of the legislation, the Kerrey-Grassley legislation \nlast year, there were always points being made by the IRS that \nwe are going to change this, we are going to change that, we \nare going to fine tune that, and everything else, always the \nIRS coming on as a Johnny-come-lately to make change.\n    Just yesterday they announced a seven-point program to \nimprove oversight of the IRS Criminal Investigative Division. \nWhy is the IRS only willing to make change at a point where \nCongress is exposing some very bad wrongdoing?\n    So I want to begin by saying thank you to the witnesses who \nwill testify before this committee today. I know that for all \nIRS employees or any government employee there is great peer \npressure to go along, to get along with those in the \norganization. Anybody who wants to say that anything is wrong \nis kind of treated like a skunk at a Sunday picnic.\n    It takes courage and conviction to sit before us, before \nthe glare of television cameras and before the watching eyes of \nthe IRS and tell your stories. Such courage is rare. Such \ncourage must be encouraged and it must be commended.\n    Such conviction is admirable, for it is the sort of \nconviction, the conviction to stand up against abuses, to stand \nup for what is right, that is the backbone of freedom and \nfairness. Freedom and fairness is what America is all about.\n    This week we will hear testimony about horrors caused by \nIRS agents that happened at the IRS. This does not mean that \nall IRS employees are bad. To the contrary, these hearings \nwould not happen without the assistance of good, hardworking \nIRS employees.\n    These hearings are part of a bigger process, a bigger duty \nof Congress. One of Congress' most important duties is the \noversight of Federal Government. I am not a newcomer to \nCongressional oversight because it has been a centerpiece of my \ncareer. These hearings will demonstrate the importance, the \nnecessity, of Congressional oversight.\n    At this moment, these hearings are about these people and \nthe horrendous acts that have taken place. But in the bigger \npicture they are proof that more oversight and more diligent \noversight is vital.\n    Hopefully these hearings indicate that Congress is willing \nto step up to the plate and do its part and its constitutional \nresponsibility of continuing IRS oversight, as well as other \ngovernment agencies.\n    The IRS restructuring legislation recently reported out of \ncommittee has strong oversight provisions in it. It is \nimperative for any legislation to be effective that the Senate \ncontinue its diligent oversight.\n    So I commend Senator Roth, and particularly his staffer \nEric Thornton, for their work on these hearings.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Grassley.\n    We, next, have Senator Kerrey."

"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","baucus","Senator Baucus","    Mr. Chairman, first, I cannot even say \nhello in 3 minutes, so I would like to ask unanimous consent \nthat my statement be a part of the record.\n    The Chairman. Without objection."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    To begin with, throughout this you and I \nhave had some disagreements, but I want to continually and \nconsistently congratulate you and thank you for holding these \nhearings. I think it is very important. I hope, as Senator \nBaucus said, we are able to get some hearings on the compliance \nissue.\n    A week ago Sunday there was an article in the New York \nTimes, a long one, in the Business Section talking about a \ncompany, I believe that was in Montana, actually, the Columbia \nRiver Aluminum Company, that not only ripped their employees \noff for $100 million, but parked all their income in the \nBahamas so they would not have to pay any taxes. There is an \nawful lot of that that goes on.\n    I am no apologist for the IRS. Congressman Portman and I, \nand Senator Shelby before that, launched this effort over 2 \nyears ago. Indeed, the three points that I intend to make \nduring this hearing is that most of the problems we are going \nto hear about are addressed in the legislation.\n    If they are not, then we ought to get it in the law so when \nit comes up on the floor we are able to change the law to take \ncare of the various problems that we are identifying, and that \nthere is an urgency to do so, that there is an urgency for us \nto get that law changed.\n    The second point I intend to make during the hearings is \nthat during our restructuring process from the public we heard \nover and over and over from citizens that, because the IRS has \n535 members of its board of directors called the Congress, the \nIRS is not Sears and Roebuck, it is created by law, they \nbelieve that Congress is the problem and they do not have to \nlook much further than a piece of legislation we passed last \nweek, the Coverdale Education IRA bill. That is the 64th tax \nlaw change since 1986.\n    Now, who is going to have to administer that? I mean, just \nlook at the detail of that tax law. It allows tax-free \nwithdrawals, but taxpayers are going to have to keep receipts, \ndetailed receipts. We tell the IRS to go out and audit. We are \ngoing to tell the IRS to go out and make sure the taxpayers \nhave those receipts.\n    If you look at the detail in the law and the requirements \nupon the IRS, you can imagine all sorts of additional problems \nthat will be created as a result. So I say that with great \nrespect and I look forward to the Chairman's hearings on tax \nsimplification. There is tax simplification analysis required.\n    The IRS Commissioner, under the legislation passed by this \ncommission, would be at the table when tax laws are written so \nthey could comment on behalf of taxpayers, who spend, some \nestimate, up to $200 billion a year just complying with the \nCode. But I intend to make the point that much of the problem \nthat we hear about occurs as a consequence of laws that the \nCongress passes.\n    So I am hopeful, Mr. Chairman, that we are able to get some \nadditional hearings on tax compliance. A significant number of \nAmericans believe that they pay higher taxes as a result of \nsomebody else paying lower because they have lawyers, \naccountants, and all sorts of people hired to figure out how \nthey can avoid paying their fair share.\n    I hope as well that we can get quickly to the simplicity \nissue because I think it is an overriding issue in terms of our \nability to be able to say to the American taxpayer, we are not \nonly going to give the IRS Commissioner authority to run the \nagency, but we are going to reduce the complexity and the cost \nto you.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Kerrey. As I already \nmentioned, these hearings will deal, in part, with compliance. \nI agree as to the importance of that matter.\n    I would, next, call on my good friend Senator Breaux."

"breaux","Senator Breaux","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, once again, \nfor putting together these hearings.\n    I was talking to someone from Louisiana this weekend and \nthey said, well, what are you folks going to be doing this week \nin the Senate? I said, well, we are going to start off with \nsome more hearings on the Internal Revenue Service and the \nproblems within the service.\n    His question back to me, which I think was somewhat \nappropriate, was when are you fellows going to quit talking \nabout it and do something about it? I think that is a valid \npoint.\n    We could probably do this for the rest of the year and \nstill hear the problems, but at some point we have to put the \nproblems aside and say, all right, we know what the problems \nare, what are we going to do to correct the problems? I think \nthat we have a vehicle that goes a long ways towards doing \nthat. We have passed it out of this committee. It has already \npassed the House of Representatives. It is now waiting to be \ntaken up in the Senate.\n    So the question back for my constituent, when are you going \nto quit talking about it and start doing something about it, I \nthink is a very legitimate and valid question. We have to do \nsomething about it more than just continue to talk about it, \nbecause we could do that for a long time.\n    The second point, however, is all of us know at least \nvarious versions of the two greatest lies ever told, one of \nwhich is, I am from the Federal Government and I am here to \nhelp you. Most people in our country do not believe that the \nFederal Government is there to help them, and in many cases do \nnot believe the Federal Government is even on their side.\n    We will hear today from a witness from my State of \nLouisiana, Ray Mayo, who has a very impressive tale to tell as \na lawyer representing people before the Internal Revenue \nService.\n    Senator Kerrey talked about the complexity of the law and \nhow much we make it complex, and he is right on target on that. \nBut I think even more important than the fact that everybody \nhas a difficult time interpreting the law is the attitude of \nFederal agents that go to the point of actually threatening \npeople who practice before the IRS and represent clients. That \nis a far more serious problem, in my view, than carrying out \nthe intricacies of the Federal Code.\n    We cannot tolerate, in a free society, any government \nagencies or government employees that threaten individual \nAmerican citizens for trying to follow the law. That, more than \nanything else, is what disturbs me the greatest about what we \nare fighting through these hearings.\n    His story is very frightening in a free society, to think \nthat because we do not like you representing your clients, \nwell, we are just going to go out and audit you, and then carry \nout that threat with actual audits that continue ad infinitum. \nThat is wrong. That is the most serious type of concern that I \nthink we need to be following and following up on, but \neventually we have got to do something about it.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Breaux.\n    Senator Murkowski."

"","","breaux","Senator Breaux","    Senator Murkowski. Good morning, Mr. Chairman. I very much \nappreciate and join with my colleagues in commending you for \ninitiating this series of hearings this morning. The \ninformation that was developed by this committee last \nSeptember, and I think earlier this year, really provided the \nfoundation for the IRS reform legislation which was reported \nunanimously from this committee and which will be considered on \nthe Senate floor next week. So, as we reflect on where we have \nbeen, at least up until now, Mr. Chairman, we have been working \nin a bipartisan manner and our action has been unanimous.\n    I think that this latest series of hearings examining the \nworkings of the Criminal Investigation Division, the CID, at \nthe IRS, I believe it is not a coincidence that just yesterday, \nas has been pointed out by you and others, there was the \nannouncement of a seven-point plan to improve its Criminal \nInvestigation Division.\n    The IRS had plenty of time to initiate this. It is \ncoincidental. I commend them, but it is rather interesting to \nsee the sequence of timing here, just before our committee \nhearing they announce the seven-point plan.\n    I do not think this is surprising. It is a reality that far \ntoo often Federal agencies tend to act as if they are a law \nunto themselves, believing they are accountable to no one. I \ncan think of several Federal agencies that would fit into that, \nthe Forest Service, for one, under its current management.\n    It is only when Congress exercises its constitutional \nobligation of oversight to the people, only then do the \nagencies begin to reconsider how they are doing business \nbecause they know they are being examined, as they should be, \nas a consequence of our oversight.\n    So it is my hope that, as the Congress passes the IRS \nreform bill, we will not end this oversight process, that we \ncan change laws, but we must be vigilant in our efforts to \nensure that the people within the IRS are held accountable in \nhow the law is enforced. This is the one key purpose of our \noversight.\n    I would remind my colleagues, particularly relative to what \nwe have accomplished here, is when we sat down we agreed that \nthere was no accountability in the IRS. We agreed that the \nsystem was designed to avoid accountability. If we have any \nobligation in an oversight capacity, it is to ensure that there \nis accountability in the IRS.\n    So I have read through the testimony that has been \nsubmitted. I want to express my concerns about one aspect of \nthe testimony that we will hear. I understand that one of the \nwitnesses will testify about the harassment and intimidation he \nfaced because he as an attorney who represented a taxpayer. I \nthink that has already been mentioned this morning.\n    But if the IRS uses threat of criminal or civil proceedings \nto punish taxpayers, and particularly a taxpayer's legal \nadvocate, I think we have an extraordinarily serious problem.\n    Our system of justice is based on the belief that a citizen \nhas a right to counsel who will represent his client without \nhesitation. If counsel believes that representing a client \nbefore the IRS carries with it the threat of personal audit or \nan IRS criminal investigation of counsel, then the scales of \njustice are fundamentally undermined.\n    No legal system can survive if legal counsel fears personal \nretaliatory threat from the government merely for representing \nthe interests of a client. I think this is a very serious issue \nand I hope that the committee will closely examine this matter, \nand other testimony before us.\n    I was disappointed in the comments from my good friend, the \nSenator from Montana, relative to the partisanship of this. I \nthink the issue is accountability. If we do not get \naccountability out of this process we are wasting everybody's \ntime, Mr. Chairman.\n    Again, I commend you for your diligence and commitment to \nproceed in this, and the American public is yearning for reform \nof the IRS, make no mistake about it.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Murkowski.\n    Now it is my pleasure to call on Senator Nickles."

"","","breaux","Senator Breaux","    Senator Nickles. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.\n    For our colleagues that said they want to see some action, \nI talked to the Majority Leader yesterday, I think we are going \nto have the reform bill on the floor next week, so we are going \nto see some action.\n    Also, this committee is directly responsible for cleaning \nup a lot of the IRS abuses, and done in a bipartisan way. No \none can say that the bill that we put together is partisan. It \nwas not partisan.\n    I will just give you a couple of examples. Some people were \nsaying, well, let us just pass the House bill. We can pass that \nunanimously and it can be signed into law by the bill. But we \nare adding a provision that came out in Oklahoma, and also the \nhearings here, that a taxpayer would be given the opportunity \nfor a court hearing before liens, levies, or seizures of his \nassets. That is a very important provision. It was not in the \nHouse bill, but is in the Senate bill.\n    We are putting in a provision that IRS can only seize a \ntaxpayer's business or home as a last resort. We are putting in \na provision that says that penalties and interest would not \naccrue to the deficiency if the IRS does not notify the \ntaxpayer within a year.\n    I could go on with several. I have got about a dozen things \nthat we added that was not in the House bill, is in the Senate \nbill, that are very, very positive in protecting taxpayers. So, \nwe are going to see some action as a direct result of the \nhearings that we had in this committee.\n    So, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for doing it. I want \nto thank you for your persistence, because a lot of people were \nsaying, let us just pass what the House did. We are going to \ncome up with a bill that is much better than the House bill. We \nare going to put in some provisions for innocent spouses, for \nexample.\n    One other thing, Mr. Chairman, I will just mention. We had \nhearings in Oklahoma. Every once in a while I think IRS is \ngetting it because I hear, oh, yes, they are going to come up \nwith some reforms, and that is good.\n    We had a hearing, Mr. Chairman, of a woman who was a pet \ngroomer and 10 years ago realized she owed $4,000, was willing \nto work it out and make payments on a monthly basis and pay it \noff in two or 3 years, and the IRS said no. They accumulated \ninterest and penalties up to $30,000. We exposed this in the \nhearing in Oklahoma.\n    As a result of that, she has made offers to the IRS. \nSupposedly IRS said, well, we accept your offer. They will take \nthe $4,000 and settle the case. She presented a certified check \nto the IRS for $4,000, which they said by letter they would \naccept, and then they said, no, we cannot do that because of \ninterest.\n    Interest on $4,000--she paid 2 days after they accepted \nit--was $1.37. They still have a lien on this woman's home, who \nis a pet groomer, from a case that goes back 10 years. What was \nthe dispute now? The interest of the $4,000 over 2 days, and \nthe lien still exists. So I am not sure the IRS gets it yet.\n    In the bill that we will take up next week we say that \nliens will not be allowed if the original tax debt was less \nthan $5,000, and would have solved that case. The IRS will be \nrequired to adopt liberal acceptance policies for offers and \ncompromise.\n    Clearly, you have a case where an agent was not willing to \ndo that, for a couple of bucks. It is ridiculous, the \nharassment, the anguish that taxpayers go through because \nsometimes people do not show common sense.\n    We also put in a provision to fire employees that abuse \ntheir power. We found cases in Oklahoma and Arkansas where \npower was clearly abused and, to date, no one has been \ndisciplined; a couple of people have been transferred, one \nperson retired early.\n    So, Mr. Chairman, I think your hearings have resulted in \ngood legislation. As the hearings go on, the legislation is \nimproving. I think we have improved the House bill \nconsiderably, and I compliment you for it. I also compliment \nyou for the hearings this week as well.\n    The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator Nickles.\n    It is now my pleasure to call upon my distinguished \ncolleague, the Ranking Member, scholar in residence, Senator \nMoynihan."

I was informed the schedule had been changed, and I am here \na bit late, so I will not take but a moment to thank you again \nfor resuming these hearings.\n    These are the first such in a century and a half. The \nInternal Revenue Service was established in 1862, which was the \nfirst time the Federal Government enacted an income tax, and it \nhas grown very considerably and with very little oversight from \nthis committee.

We are already seeing the energy in which he is \nproceeding.\n    In one specific, he has asked Charles Bowsher, the former \nhead of the General Accounting Office with a great range of \ninterests and ability in the area of public administration, to \nperform an independent review of the IRS Inspection Service. I \nthink we shall learn a good deal from that, and I look forward \nto it.\n    I look forward to these hearings, and ask that my statement \nbe placed in the record.\n    The Chairman.

"bryan","Senator Bryan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for \ncalling this hearing this morning.\n    The abuse of taxpayers is inexcusable. Once the facts of \nthese cases can be demonstrated, I will eagerly join with you, \nMr. Chairman, and the rest of our colleagues in demanding that \nCommissioner Rossotti take immediate and decisive action to \neliminate any injustices that we discover this week.\n    Taxpayers have the right to be treated with courtesy, they \nhave the right to be treated fairly and honestly by the IRS, \nand no taxpayer should be subject to or fearful of some kind of \narbitrary star chamber treatment at the hands of the IRS.\n    Any Federal employee or organization that abuses the public \ntrust should be dealt with harshly, and the IRS is clearly no \nexception. We need to pass legislation to address the many \nproblems in the agency that our hearings last fall and the \nhearings this week will indicate.\n    We need to pass the IRS reform bill that we reported out \nearlier this year sooner rather than later. Commissioner \nRossotti has already proven himself able and ready to meet the \nmany challenges at the IRS, and we need to give him the tools \nto achieve the real results.\n    While the outrages we will hear of this week certainly \ndeserve our immediate response, I think it is important to \nretain some perspective. Millions of Americans pay their taxes \nevery year. Yes, April 15th is a painful experience for each of \nus, but the vast majority of Americans pay their taxes each \nyear. Protecting these honest, hardworking taxpayers needs to \nbe our highest priority.\n    One of the biggest grievances that I hear about our tax \nsystem is that many people feel that not everyone is paying his \nor her fair share. Most Americans file a relatively simple, \nstraightforward 1040 form with a few simple deductions, maybe \nsome modest capital gains.\n    But there is a growing suspicion among typical taxpayers \nthat somehow someone else is getting better treatment, taking \nadvantage of complicated special tax loopholes that relieve \nthat person or that entity of his, her, or its proper share of \nthe tax burden through tax shelters, corporate loopholes, and \nthe like.\n    Even worse, in my opinion, Mr. Chairman, are those who \ncheat the government, the tax evaders. The general public knows \nthat if individuals do not pay their taxes, that the burden is \nshifted to them and it means that they will pay higher taxes.\n    Some estimates show that Federal revenues lost to \nnoncompliance may approach $100 billion a year, a staggering \nsum. Pols show a very real suspicion that not everyone is \npaying their fair share. On average, Americans believe that \none-third cheat on their taxes. Noncompliance is a serious \nproblem, one that hits every honest taxpayer in the pocketbook \neach and every April 15th.\n    I would hope, Mr. Chairman, in the interest of providing \nbalance to these proceedings, that we might have some hearings \naddressed to the tax cheat and the tax evader as well. I look \nforward to working with you in the hearings this week, and in \nthe future week, in moving the IRS reform legislation to \nenactment in this Congress.\n    The Chairman.

Without objection.\n    Senator Mack. Senator Moynihan said a few moments ago that \nthere has been very little oversight of the IRS. I would say it \nhas not just been this committee, it has been the Commissioner, \nit has been the Treasury. Virtually everyone has kind of looked \nthe other way when it has come to the IRS.\n    So my point here is, while I understand the frustration \nsome members may feel with getting on with it, the reality is, \nwe have just begun to focus. So I would encourage you to \ncontinue to have oversight hearings. In fact, the Majority \nLeader is fond of saying that one of the things that we have \nnot done well is oversight.\n    I think you are to be commended for the effort that you are \nmaking. Those who are anxious to get on with it will have the \nopportunity next week, as I believe the legislation will move \nto the floor. So I commend you for oversight and would \nencourage you to continue it.\n    The last point that I would make is, fortunately we have \nwhat I would consider brave taxpayers, practitioners, and \nothers who are willing to come forward and speak the truth \nabout abuses that they have seen, regardless of the fear that \nthey have about being intimidated by those who want to see that \nthe status quo is maintained.\n    So again, I commend you for these hearings and I look \nforward to hearing from our witnesses.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Mack.\n    And finally we have Senator Conrad."

"conrad","Senator Conrad","bryan","Senator Bryan","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    I just would indicate that I have a prepared statement as \nwell that I would ask to be made part of the record.\n    The Chairman. Without objection."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Instead of going through that, Mr. \nChairman, I would just make some observations as well. First of \nall, I agree with what Senator Mack has said. We do have an \nobligation of oversight and there has been too little of it, \nnot just with respect to the Internal Revenue Service, but I \nthink that is a general indictment of those of us in Congress \nwho focus more on getting the budgets done every year, the \nappropriations bills done every year, and new legislation. Part \nof our responsibility is oversight, and there has clearly been \na failure of oversight of this agency.\n    I think one thing we need to say loud and clear and up \nfront, is that abusive treatment of taxpayers is totally \nunacceptable. Anybody in any agency who abuses taxpayers ought \nto be punished. That is just unacceptable. If we do not treat \nthe taxpayers with respect, that breeds disrespect for the \nsystem, so that is something we cannot tolerate.\n    I think it is also important to acknowledge that there are \nmany in the Internal Revenue Service who are honest, who are \ncapable, and who do not disrespect taxpayers. Those people \nshould not be sullied or marred by the few who have abused the \nsystem, who have acted unfairly, inappropriately, and even at \ntimes illegally.\n    Mr. Chairman, I would also want to add my voice to that of \nSenator Bryan. As a former tax commissioner myself at the State \nlevel and a former chairman of the Multi-State Tax Commission, \nI know there are a small percentage of taxpayers who also abuse \nthe system and abuse everyone else who is in the system. That \nalso should not be tolerated.\n    It is not fair to the vast majority of taxpayers who do pay \nwhat they legitimately owe to have more of a burden put on \ntheir shoulders because of the small percentage of people who \nthink they are above the law and beyond the law and have no \nobligation to pay what they legitimately owe.\n    The word should go out from this committee, just as we say \nit is intolerable that IRS agents abuse taxpayers, it is also \nintolerable that some who are supposed to be taxpayer are \nabusing other taxpayers by failing to pay what they owe.\n    Mr. Chairman, finally, I would say I also agree that the \nlegislation that came out of this committee to reform the IRS \nis far superior to what came out of the House. You are to be \ncommended for a much better bill than what came out of the \nHouse. And it is important that we pass that legislation on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n    I know that is not your responsibility, but I would address \nmy remarks to the Majority Leader, who does control the \nschedule, and urge him to take up the IRS reform bill at his \nearliest possible opportunity. I know the Majority Leader has \nmany competing demands for floor time, but I would hope we \nwould move that IRS reform bill at our earliest opportunity.\n    I would just alert the Majority Leader that Senator Nickles \nindicated that you may intend to bring that bill to the floor \nnext week, and I think that would be an excellent move \nfollowing these hearings.\n    So again, Mr. Chairman, thank you for conducting these \noversight hearings. I think it is important and I think we have \ngot an obligation to do it. I again commend you for the \nexcellent bill you helped produce in this committee.\n    The Chairman. Just let me repeat what I have said before, \nthat you are living proof that you can be a tax collector and \nstill elected to office. So, I congratulate you. [Laughter.]\n     It is now my pleasure to call on the Majority Leader, \nSenator Lott."

"lott","Senator Lott","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I know that \nseveral Senators have already had statements to make, and I do \nnot want to give one at this point. I am very interested in \nhearing the witnesses and the other witnesses we will have this \nweek.\n    I want to commend you and the Ranking Member for going \nforward with these hearings. I want to assure the Senators on \nthe committee and the full Senate that it is my intent that the \nIRS reform bill come up next week. I believe that we should be \nable to begin, if the Chairman is ready, Monday.\n    We do have a number of other important issues that we will \nbe trying to get done before that and immediately afterward. I \nhope that we can do it within a reasonable period of days, but \nit is our intent for it to be first up next week.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the leadership you have \nprovided on this issue.\n    The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator Lott.\n    Before I recognize the first panel I would like to welcome \nJennifer Long, who was a witness at our hearings in September. \nWe appreciate her being here today.\n    We now come to welcoming the members of our first panel, \nemployees of the Department of the Treasury. As I said earlier, \nthere could be no hearings if it were not for the willingness \nof employees to come to us and testify about their concern.\n    Senator Conrad, I just want to once again echo what you \nsaid and what I said in my opening remarks about the employees \nof the IRS because I do think it is critically important that \neveryone understand that the vast majority of employees of the \nIRS are intelligent, hardworking, and doing the best they can, \nsometimes under very adverse, difficult circumstances.\n    But these employees that are on the first panel, I think, \nwill provide the committee with information and insight about \nthe problems within the IRS involving investigation of employee \nmisconduct. They will also address what appears to be a lack of \ninternal disciplinary action taken against employees when \nallegations of wrongdoing are substantiated.\n    Our witnesses include Mr. Richard Calahan, who is the \nDeputy Inspector General, Office of the IG at the Department of \nthe Treasury; Mr. Harry Patsalides, who is the Deputy Assistant \nInspector General for Investigation at the Department of \nTreasury; and Ms. Yvonne D.

break,break,break,break
"","","lott","Senator Lott","    Mr. Patsalides. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I \nappear before you today to discuss our investigative work at \nthe Internal Revenue Service. As the Deputy Assistant Inspector \nGeneral for Investigations, I have overseen our office's \ninvestigations of the IRS and will discuss some of our recent \nefforts.\n    The hearings held before this committee last September \nproduced several groups of allegations which were referred for \ninvestigation to the Treasury Office of Inspector General. In \naddition, telephone calls to the OIG hotline more than doubled \nin response to those hearings.\n    This provided a serious challenge to our investigative \nresources, as the OIG Office of Investigations has the \nresponsibility for investigating all employees at the eight \nnon-law enforcement bureaus, as well as senior level officials \nand all employees in the Offices of Inspection, Internal \nAffairs, and Chief Counsel at each of the four law enforcement \nbureaus.\n    Our staffing was insufficient to conduct a number of \nsignificant cases that warranted investigation. Because of \nthis, many issues had to be returned to the bureaus for action, \nsince we lacked the resources to conduct the necessary \ninvestigations.\n    Our efforts were focused on four significant investigations \ninvolving misconduct by IRS officials. All of the allegations \nwere investigated. Due to limited resources, we could only \nfully staff one of the investigations. We requested IRS \nInspection to conduct two investigations, with OIG review. The \nfourth investigation was conducted by the OIG, but assistance \nwas needed from three IRS inspectors and two Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, and Firearms agents.\n    The four investigations pertained to a series of complaints \ninvolving: (1) IRS mismanagement and mistreatment of taxpayers; \n(2) the use of collection statistics by IRS Collection Division \nmanagers to determine employee and group performance ratings; \n(3) the establishment of an IRS national policy regarding the \nuse of collection statistics; and (4) reprisals against IRS \nemployees who testified before this committee.\n    Because of its large scope, we referred the allegations \nregarding the questionable use of collection statistics to the \nIRS Chief Inspector's Office. Subsequently, we reviewed their \nwork with the assistance of experienced investigators on detail \nto us from other Treasury law enforcement bureaus of ATF, the \nSecret Service, and the Customs Service. We appreciate the \nsupport provided by the department and those bureaus in this \nendeavor.\n    Senator Nickles, in the February 5th Finance Committee \nhearing, requested that we investigate a group of allegations \nhe received regarding the Internal Revenue Service. We obtained \nthe assistance of investigators from ATF and the IRS \nInspections to work under OIG supervision on these allegations.\n    On October 23, 1997, our office initiated an investigation \nregarding the allegations raised to the Senate Finance \nCommittee by IRS employee Jennifer Long. During the \ninvestigation of the allegations raised by Ms. Long, additional \nissues were identified which have led to possibly six new cases \nbeing opened by our office.\n    As a result of the investigation of Long's allegations, we \nnoted several areas of significant concern. IRS management \nappears to treat managers differently than employees when it \npertains to disciplinary action. We were advised that IRS \nmanagers are allowed to voluntarily step down from their \nmanagement position rather than being involuntarily removed. \nIRS management stated this was done to avoid the cost of a \npotential lawsuit.\n    An inspection manager stated that, ``IRS managers are \npunished less severely than IRS employees.'' It was this \nmanager's opinion that, since most managers have worked well \nfor years with little or no prior problems, that their \ntransgressions have been viewed with less severity.\n    We are also concerned that if an employee files a \ngrievance, an EEO complaint, or a lawsuit against an IRS \nmanager and the employee wins the settlement, usually no \ndisciplinary action is taken against the manager for allegedly \nviolating the rights of the employee.\n    This lack of disciplinary action may send a message to \nmanagers that they are free to harass an employee without being \npersonally accountable. This also sends a message to employees \nthat they cannot bring action against a manager who harasses or \nretaliates against them because only the agency is held \naccountable.\n    Employees may fear retaliation by management for reporting \ncomplaints to Inspection. Long alleged that Inspection advises \nIRS management of allegations provided to them and who provided \nthe information.\n    There appears to be disagreement among Inspection employees \nregarding whether or not complainants' names are provided to \nmanagement. Several of the Inspection employees interviewed \nsaid the complainants' names are provided to management, while \nothers indicated the names are not provided.\n    When employees bring a complaint to Inspection they are \nroutinely not advised whether the information will be \ninvestigated by Inspection or referred to IRS management. When \nmanagement decides to address the complaint it does not advise \nInspection of their action taken regarding the issue.\n    If the complaint to Inspection concerns a manager and is \nsubsequently referred to management, the manager may \nunnecessarily be advised of the complaint and the complainant's \nname. Once management is alerted to the complaint, the employee \nmay fear retaliation for lodging the complaint.\n    Before concluding my oral statement I would also like to \nmention one of the most significant problems that our office \nhas with the current oversight arrangement. With regard to \naccessing tax information, our office does not have the same \nlevel of access to IRS information that is afforded to the \nOffice of Chief Inspector.\n    While for the most part we have been able to obtain the \nneeded information, we have had instances where access was \nrefused or delayed and we had to expend unnecessary time and \neffort to resolve the matter or find alternatives to accomplish \nour objectives.\n    Legislative impediments center around two provisions in the \n1988 Inspector General Act amendments. First, the OIG is \nrequired to provide notice to the IRS of its intent to access \nreturns or return information.\n    Second, with reference to Chapter 75 of the Internal \nRevenue Code, the OIG may report to the Attorney General only \noffenses under Section 7214 without first obtaining the consent \nof the IRS Commissioner.\n    This provision restricts the authority of the Treasury OIG \nto refer violations of the Internal Revenue Code such as \nSection 7213 pertaining to unauthorized disclosures of returns \nor return information to the Department of Justice.\n    Both of these provisions have affected our work. One, is a \nprocess totally inconsistent with independent investigative \nprocedure because it requires OIG investigators to needlessly \nnotify others of the direction of their investigation.\n    The requirement for obtaining IRS Commissioner consent on \nreferrals to the Department of Justice creates the possibility \nfor conflicts of interest and precludes an objective review of \nthe prosecutive potential.\n    In conclusion, while performing our normally extensive \ninvestigative responsibilities at the IRS, we were tasked, in \nresponse to this committee's September hearing, to intensify \nour investigative efforts in specific areas.\n    Through the extraordinary efforts of our entire staff, we \nmet this additional challenge and maintained our normal duties \nand responsibilities in an effective and timely manner. I can \nstate to this committee that I am proud of the performance of \nour staff.\n    Thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts with \nyou. I will be happy to address any questions that you may \nhave.\n    The Chairman. Well, thank you, Mr. Patsalides.\n    The Chairman. We will hear from the final member of the \npanel first, then we will address questions to all of you.\n    It is now my pleasure to call upon Ms. DesJardins."

break,break,break,break
"","","lott","Senator Lott","    Ms. DesJardins. Mr. Chairman and honorable members of this \ncommittee, I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you \ntoday to share with you some of my experiences since working at \nthe Internal Revenue Service.\n    During the period March 1991 through October 1996, I was an \nemployee of the Internal Revenue Service. Since October 1996, I \nhave been employed with the Office of Chief Counsel, Internal \nRevenue Service, where I currently serve as the Chief of the \nEmployee and Labor Relations Section of the Personnel Branch.\n    During my tenure with the IRS I have worked in both \nsupervisory and non-supervisory personnel positions and have \nhad responsibility for providing advisory services to IRS \nmanagers regarding employee performance and conduct issues, up \nto and including the executive level.\n    During this time, I have observed how higher graded \nemployees of the organization are not held to the same \nstandards as employees of lesser grades, particularly when \nmisconduct occurs.\n    My statement should not come as a surprise, particularly \nwhen one recalls the comprehensive investigation in 1988 into \nalleged ethics and integrity violations by IRS senior officials \nwhich culminated in hearings referred to as the Bernard \nhearings, and reported to the 102nd Congress in House Report \n1021065 entitled ``IRS Programs to Combat Senior Level \nMisconduct: Getting Stronger, But Still A Long Way to Go.''\n    This report identified serious problems with the manner in \nwhich IRS failed to properly handle misconduct of senior level \nofficials, particularly with respect to appropriate \ndisciplinary actions.\n    The report concluded that the IRS culture needed to be \nchanged to demonstrate that misconduct by anyone, including \nsenior level officials, would not be tolerated and that \nemployees could report misconduct without fear or reprisal or \nretaliation against whistleblowers.\n    As a result of this report, the IRS implemented an \naggressive ethics program which required every IRS employee to \nparticipate in training, and included ethics publications and \nextensive internal communications efforts.\n    Unfortunately, ethics is something that a person cannot be \ntaught with brief classroom training. Therefore, I am here \ntoday to report that ethics in the IRS still has a long way to \ngo in order to persuade taxpayers and the IRS work force that \nfair, equitable, and consistent treatment of all is paramount \nto the IRS.\n    I can only speak from my personal experiences and \nobservations since working for the IRS. Unfortunately, a good \nportion of what I have observed leaves much to be desired when \nit comes to consistent treatment of individuals regarding \ndiscipline and in the manner in which the IRS deals with \nwhistleblowers.\n    The whistleblowers are ostracized and careers destroyed, \nand those senior officials who engaged in the misconduct which \nwas reported and substantiated are not only protected from \nreceiving any disciplinary actions, but are oftentimes rewarded \nduring the same year the misconduct occurs. Again, I speak from \npersonal experience.\n    During the period May 1994 to October 1996, I handled the \nmany reports of misconduct that were made against any senior \nIRS officials grade 15 and above. These reports were in the \nform of investigations, telephonic hotline complaints, and \nwritten complaints. For approximately a 2-year period I had \nprogram responsibility for these matters and recommendations \nwere made to the Deputy Commissioner of IRS.\n    While a good portion of these complaints were made by \ndisgruntled employees and resulted in either closing without \naction or possibly a counseling of the individual, there were \ninstances of serious misconduct which ultimately required \ndisciplinary action against a senior official. In some \ninstances, actions were taken. However, in many instances they \nwere not.\n    In those instances where no action was taken it appeared \nthat those individuals were being protected by the organization \nby either being reassigned, with payment of relocation \nexpenses, or until they either retired or sufficient time had \nelapsed to make the matter moot.\n    As an example, I recall one instance of an executive who \nwas investigated by the Office of Inspector General, Department \nof the Treasury, for travel fraud. The allegations were \nsubstantiated, yet no action against this person was \nforthcoming. Rather, the report remained in the Deputy \nCommissioner's Office for an extended period of time with no \naction taken.\n    Another example involved a senior IRS official who had a \nreputation for abusing and mistreating subordinates, regardless \nof where this person worked in the organization. The OIG \ninvestigated this individual and the results of the \ninvestigation supported a serious disciplinary action. Again, \nhowever, the case remained in the Deputy Commissioner's Office \nfor well over one year with no action taken.\n    A third case involved another travel fraud issue by an \nexecutive. This particular case was closed with a minor action, \nalthough it was substantiated that the individual provided \nfalse statements not only during the course of the \ninvestigation, but to the Commissioner as well when required to \npetition for a waiver of the funds in question.\n    Another case involved sexual harassment by a senior \nofficial. Although a disciplinary action was recommended, it \nremained on the Deputy Commissioner's desk for over 2 years, at \nwhich time the executive retired and the case was closed. The \ndisciplinary action was never issued to the executive.\n    In a more recent action for which I was personally involved \nas the whistleblower, senior officials were not disciplined \neven though the allegations of fraud, waste, and abuse were \nsubstantiated by the OIG and reported to the Office of Special \nCounsel.\n    These allegations involved serious misconduct by certain \nIRS officials with responsibility for carrying out the \npersonnel programs of the IRS. These actions, which included \nthe processing of illegal performance appraisals and awards, \nwould have had a detrimental effect on any reduction in force \nthat the IRS would have had to run, yet no actions were taken \neven though the misconduct was reported, investigated by the \nOIG, and substantiated well in advance of IRS plans to run a \nreduction in force. A subordinate manager was directed to \nprovide a false report regarding this matter.\n    Additionally, time and attendance fraud was brought to the \nattention of this same official, and I and others were directed \nto not report the matter to Inspection merely because this \nperson was new in the position and did not want to confront the \nmatter because of who the individuals committing the fraud were \nand the potential political problems which would have resulted \nwith the confrontation. Even though this matter was raised \nnumerous times, no action was ever taken.\n    Again, this issue was reported to the OSC and substantiated \nby the OIG during its investigation. To date, the person \nresponsible for this misconduct remains in this position of \ntrust and is authorized to carry out the personnel program for \nthe IRS.\n    The egregious misconduct, as well as misconduct by other \nofficials, was substantiated by the OIG during its \ninvestigation and interview of approximately 20 witnesses, yet \nwas ultimately viewed by the Deputy Commissioner of the IRS as \na minor infraction of rules and no disciplinary action was \ntaken.\n    In the meantime, because I challenged this misconduct and \nultimately reported it to the OSC in October 1994, I have \nsuffered retaliation and continue to suffer retaliation as a \nresult of my whistleblowing activities and participation in the \nOIG investigation.\n    Additionally, I have expended an outrageous amount of \npersonal funds for legal expenses, yet no relief is \nforthcoming. When I attempted to seek employment outside of the \nIRS, my efforts were stopped by my present organization through \nfalse and misleading information, as well as disclosure of my \nprotected activities during the background check.\n    I have been told that my first- and second-line managers no \nlonger have trust and confidence in me, and my attorney was \ntold by the executive for whom I work that I am a liar and a \nmanipulator, a statement which he now denies.\n    There are other examples that can be cited, but it became \nclear to me and others that senior level officials were \nconsistently protected by their fellow executives. Many of the \nprofessional personnelists who were charged with the \nresponsibility of handling these cases often joked and \ncommented that a trained personnelist was not necessary in \norder to put a ``Close Without Action'' letter on the cases.\n    It was often commented that the skills of an Employee \nRelations Specialist were considered to be a detriment rather \nthan an asset, particularly when we attempted to ensure \nconsistency of penalties in our actions.\n    The executives of the IRS are close to each other, \nfrequently socializing with each other, and often developing \nlifelong friendships. Because of this, it is extremely \ndifficult, if not impossible, for one executive to recommend \nand take an action against another.\n    I observed that in most instances warranting disciplinary \naction, more effort went into how to clear the person rather \nthan what needed to be done to ensure the misconduct did not \nrecur. Exceptions were made and preferential treatment was \ngranted. Excuses were readily accepted and misconduct was often \nreduced to being minor.\n    In several instances it became clear that the IRS applied \ndifferent standards to the higher graded individuals, which \noftentimes resulted in one set of rules for executives and \nanother for the remainder of the work force.\n    Unfortunately, it is an indication of how misconduct by \nsenior officials is viewed. There is always justification and \ngood reason for their actions, even if a double standard has to \nbe applied.\n    My purpose in appearing today is to assist you in \ndetermining the best course of action in addressing the manner \nin which senior level misconduct is investigated and dealt with \nin the IRS.\n    My appearance today is certainly at great personal risk, \nhowever, it is something that I believe is necessary. I \nsincerely believe that much needs to be done in order to raise \nthe level of ethics and integrity in order to increase the \npublic trust of the IRS. Until the IRS is sincerely willing to \ndeal with misconduct and not retaliate against those people who \nreport it, a healing process cannot begin.\n    Thank you.\n    The Chairman. Well, I want to thank both of you, Ms. \nDesJardins, and Mr. Patsalides, for being here today. I know it \ntakes a great deal of courage to appear here, that there is \nconsiderable risk. I want to thank you for discharging your \nresponsibility.\n    Ms. DesJardins, you were responsible for receiving the \nreports of investigation conducted on various IRS managers and \nproviding them to the Deputy Commissioner for action. Could you \nexplain further how this process worked and what was supposed \nto be done?\n    Ms. DesJardins. Yes, sir. The cases would come in to the \nDeputy Commissioner's Office and they, in turn, would then be \nbrought to my office, where I would log the inventory and \ncomplete a case analysis and refer the cases out for action to \nthe appropriate regional commissioner or chief officer who had \nresponsibility for the investigation. They, in turn, would \nconduct further inquiry.\n    They would make recommendations to the Deputy Commissioner. \nThe recommendations would come back to me. I would prepare \nanother case analysis and finalize it and make a recommendation \nto the Deputy Commissioner as to whether or not the proposed \naction would be acceptable.\n    The Chairman. Now, are misconduct reports on senior IRS \nexecutives being shelved at the Deputy Commissioner's level?\n    Ms. DesJardins. Yes, sir, in some instances.\n    The Chairman. How often is this a practice, could you \ncomment on that?\n    Ms. DesJardins. My observation was that, in those instances \nwhere there was serious misconduct which would support a \ndisciplinary action against an individual, they tended to be \nshelved and no decisions were made in terms of recommendations \nor what actions would be taken.\n    The Chairman. So it was not an exception, but more often a \npractice.\n    Ms. DesJardins. Yes, sir.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Patsalides.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir.\n    The Chairman. As you are aware, we have reviewed a number \nof investigation files from your office and the IRS Chief \nInspector's Office. I would like to ask you about a couple of \nthem that concern me.\n    Let me give you information from one IRS Inspection Office \nreport completed in 1995. It appears that a manager in the \nCriminal Investigation Division who was responsible for \noverseeing undercover operations in his region managed to steal \n20 government-owned vehicles for his personal gain.\n    Also, this person's supervisors were aware of his misuse of \ngovernment credit cards, yet failed to notify Inspection of his \nmisconduct. How could such a thing like that happen? What \nhappened to the individual, was he prosecuted?"
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","lott","Senator Lott","    Mr. Chairman, did you say 20 automobiles?\n    The Chairman. Twenty."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Twenty.\n    Senator Gramm. Did he have a used car business or what?\n    The Chairman. Mr. Patsalides?\n    Mr. Patsalides. Mr. Chairman, the person was prosecuted by \na method called deferred prosecution, which is not very often \nused. He had to repay $20,000 and he was put on 2 years' \nprobation. After that 2-year probation, the case is dismissed. \nThe records show that the case was dismissed.\n    The Chairman. Is he still with the IRS?\n    Mr. Patsalides. No, sir, he has left the IRS.\n    The Chairman. How long was he there after that?\n    Mr. Patsalides. I am not sure, sir, but I believe he \nretired during this process.\n    The Chairman. So he was ordered to pay $20,000 restitution, \nbut he stole, what, 20 government-owned vehicles.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Basically, the investigation disclosed that \nthe CID's office failed to account for all seized vehicles in \nthe possession of that IRS office and to verify that their use \nwas for undercover operations. So, there was a lack of internal \ncontrols there.\n    The Chairman. Now, let me ask you this. Has your agency had \nany involvement in auditing or investigating the IRS undercover \noperations?\n    Mr. Patsalides. No, sir, we have not. I checked with the \nOffice of the Chief Inspector and their last national audit of \nthis area was conducted in November 1995.\n    The Chairman. In 1995.\n    Now, I understand that the former IRS National Director of \nEEO and Diversity was investigated by the Inspections Office \nfor allegations against him involving sexual harassment. \nAccording to the report, the allegations were substantiated and \ninvolved several victims. I have a few questions I would like \nto ask.\n    Was that individual the top EEO manager in the IRS?\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes.\n    The Chairman. What happened to that individual?\n    Mr. Patsalides. He received a letter of official reprimand \nand was reassigned without a demotion.\n    The Chairman. Did this individual have any previous \ncomplaints of harassment alleged against him?\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir, he did.\n    The Chairman. What happened to these complaints?\n    Mr. Patsalides. The first complaint that was made was at \nthe point where this gentlemen was entering the Executive \nDevelopment Program and his manager did not want to address \nthat complaint because he did not want to in any way, I guess, \ndetract from this person's management development.\n    The Chairman. So in spite of concerns about alleged \nmisconduct by this individual, is it correct that he was \ntransferred to the IRS national office as the National Director \nof EEO?\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir.\n    The Chairman. Now, I have a 1996 report from the IRS \nInspection Office where an IRS revenue officer was arrested by \na State trooper for drunk driving and the IRS employee \nthreatened to audit the State trooper unless he allowed the IRS \nemployee to go.\n    Now, it seems to me that the State trooper was just doing \nhis job. But when the trooper was interviewed he stated he was \nextremely concerned and afraid of what the IRS employee could \ndo to him in terms of causing him economic hardship. What \nhappened to that IRS revenue officer; where is he today?\n    Mr. Patsalides. He is still employed. He entered into what \nthey called a last chance settlement agreement where he agreed \nto enter a rehabilitation program for his alcohol abuse, and \nalso agreed that if he had any future violations related to \nthat, that he would be fired without appeal.\n    The Chairman. So he is still dealing with taxpayers today.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir, he is.\n    The Chairman. The next case I would like to ask you about \ninvolves a distinguished tax practitioner who has provided \ntestimony before this committee's hearings. The practitioner \nreceived an anonymous written threat that was received prior to \nour September hearings when the practitioner testified which he \nbelieves was sent by an IRS revenue officer.\n    In fact, I have the letter that contained the threat in \nfront of me. The following statement was typed on the top of a \nnewspaper article that involved the IRS arresting a tax \nmediator. The statement is, ``You and your clients are next. If \nyou don't think it can happen, call David Kay and numerous \nattorneys in Los Angeles. You are currently under investigation \nand I am waiting for the day your name is in the paper.''\n    Now, when the IRS Inspection Office investigated the matter \nthey clearly determined that the letter had been typed on a \ntypewriter within the revenue officer's immediate office. What \nhappened to that IRS employee who made the threat; is he \ndealing with taxpayers today?\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir, he is. He is still there.\n    The Chairman. Can you say what happened to him?\n    Mr. Patsalides. The investigation was not able to \ncompletely substantiate that he was the one that typed this \nnote, even though the forensic lab identified that the letter \ncame from that particular office, was postmarked at that \noffice, and the typewriter ribbon was obtained and indicated \nthat the letter was typed in that office.\n    We feel, and the report did not show that, but potentially \nsome additional investigative work regarding that situation, \nsome additional interviews of the employees, review of their \ncase loads to see if there was any other involvement with that \npractitioner, plus a statement analysis might still be of help \nin identifying and pinpointing who might have sent that letter.\n    The Chairman. In other words, you feel that they called off \nthe investigation too early.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Potentially, yes, sir. I do not have the \nfull case file, so I do not know the extent of their full \ninvestigation. However, in reviewing it there is no indication \nthat they did these other things that I just mentioned. I \nbelieve that they might be able to help identify who the person \nwas.\n    The Chairman. That concludes my first round of questions.\n    Senator Moynihan?"
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    I am trying to make some sense of the organizational \nstructure here. I suppose that the fact of the Section 6103 \nconfidentiality of taxpayer returns makes for a culture of \ncompartmentalization in the IRS that is different from other \nplaces. I do not know that, but I feel that. You seem to \nindicate some agreement.\n    I would ask you, Mr. Patsalides, why do we mention no names \nhere? That fellow who robbed us of 20 automobiles, that was a \ncrime, was it not?\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Well, what is his name? The names of \ncriminals are not confidential records, are they? I just find \nthis unusual.\n    Mr. Patsalides. I am sure they are listed in the public \nrecords."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    What is his name?\n    Mr. Patsalides. But I believe I would have to check with my \ncounsel."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Have you got a counsel around?\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir. But I believe there are some \nprivacy issues there and it is not normally our process to \ndisclose those kinds of issues publicly."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Counsel, come forth."
break,break,break,break
"","","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Mr. Patsalides. Sir, with the records that we had, we were \nunable to determine if this is a matter of public record. All \nwe had were the investigative files. If, in fact, it is a \nmatter of public record we would be very pleased to provide the \nSenator with that name."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    No. I am not sort of pressing you to know \nwho the name of this man is, or where that Woodstock typewriter \ncame from and who was using it, and so forth. One is impressed \nby how tightened up your procedures are with respect to names \nand individuals. I think it rises out of the confidentiality of \ntax returns.\n    Mr. Calahan, do you have any sense of that? Or tell me if I \nam wrong. I am not infrequently wrong.\n    Mr. Calahan. Well, it arises also out of the process of \nconducting investigations. That entire process is on a need-to-\nknow basis. We are very careful."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Well, should the public not have a need \nto know?\n    Mr. Calahan. Not until it is completed."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Not until it is complete.\n    Mr. Calahan. Yes, sir. And as I said, if it is a public \nrecord, we would be happy to provide that information to you."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    I do not need the information.\n    Mr. Calahan. But we are taught to be very close-held \nregarding this kind of information."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Closely held.\n    Mr. Calahan. Yes, sir.\n    Mr. Patsalides. I would just like to add that our office \ntakes the Privacy Act very seriously and we are very careful in \nterms of how we exercise our work in accordance with its \nprovisions."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Sure. Sure. I understand and appreciate \nthat. We have comparable agencies in the government who are \nequally buttoned up, not internally, but from external inquiry, \nwhich may be part of the problem that the Chairman has \nidentified here.\n    I certainly would like to know more about this matter of \nDavid Kay and that typewriter. That is unacceptable, ``You and \nyour clients are next.'' Now, if that came from an IRS \nemployee, that is abuse of power. You would be the first to \nagree, would you not, Mr. Patsalides, Mr. Calahan?\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir.\n    Mr. Calahan. We would. We would.\n    Mr. Patsalides. I would and I can assure you that, after we \nget back to the office, we intend to meet with the Office of \nthe Chief Inspector and discuss this case and see if there is \nany additional work that can be done."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    All right. If a prothonotary warbler \nshows up in the evidence, we know we have a large issue that \nmay go beyond the confines of the U.S. borders. I am referring \nto those inquiries about Woodstock typewriter and the sighting \nof the prothonotary warbler. You youth know so little about our \nhistory.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir. [Laughter.]"
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    But do look into that, will you not?\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    This is something that we will not have, \nnor would you.\n    Mr. Patsalides. I agree. No, sir, we would not have that."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Of course you would not.\n    So, Mr. Chairman, can we hope that we will learn more about \nthat?\n    The Chairman. Absolutely.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Senator, we will take that as a request \nfrom you at this point."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Perhaps you would take it as a request \nfrom the committee, sir. Is that all right, Mr. Chairman?\n    The Chairman. That is fine."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Thank you.\n    And thank you, gentlemen. Thank you, Ms. DesJardins.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Moynihan.\n    Senator Grassley?\n    Senator Grassley. I think as we listen to the testimony \nthat we have before us that we can both be pleased that things \nlike this are coming out, but I think we obviously have to be \noutraged at the same time.\n    I am pleased that these allegations are finally coming to \nlight, but obviously we cannot stand this sort of activity in \nour government. People want to be proud of their government. \nPeople want to have trust in their government.\n    It seems to me that the agency that deals with more \nAmerican citizens than all other government agencies put \ntogether, which happens to be the IRS, is the one that can set \na standard for all other bureaucracies, and ought to set that \nstandard.\n    Obviously, as a result of just this first panel, anyone \nwatching would be very outraged at what is going on and wonder \nwhether or not we are a government of the people, whether or \nnot we are really a participatory democracy, whether the rule \nof law is followed in a bureaucracy like it is expected to be \nfollowed by the citizenry.\n    You never get used to these sorts of allegations. You never \nget desensitized to these sorts of happenings. I would like to \ntell you what it would be like to be a U.S. Senator and trying \nto justify this sort of thing at the grass roots meetings of \nthe State of Iowa.\n    Or for instance, if any of us in the Senate did exactly \nthese same things or we conducted the employment in our office \nthese ways, we would not be tolerated for a minute. We would be \nout so fast on our ears that we would not know what happened to \nus. So that is why it is very important that we have a standard \nthat we can all be very proud of.\n    Ms. DesJardins, you discussed many cases where wrongdoing \nwas found but no disciplinary action was taken. Could you, and \nif you could, would you be willing to, after these hearings \ngive us more specifics so that we, either as a committee, or \nmyself as an individual member of the committee, can pass these \non to Commissioner Rossotti? Because I think the new \nCommissioner shows a willingness to get to the bottom of all \nthese things right away, overcome these problems, and \nreestablish the credibility of the IRS. I would like to make \nsure that action is taken on these, if it is warranted.\n    Ms. DesJardins. Yes, sir. I would be happy to do that.\n    Senator Grassley. All right. Thank you very much.\n    You state in your written testimony, Mr. Patsalides, that \nyou have these limited resources that are a challenge to your \noffice.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir.\n    Senator Grassley. Is that something that you would find \nwithin the bureaucracy of the IRS, difficulty fighting for the \namount of resources you need, regardless of the amount of money \nthat the IRS gets, or is this something that you think relates \nto the fact that Congress just is not giving enough money in \nthe first place?\n    Mr. Patsalides. The Treasury Office of Inspector General is \nindependent of IRS and is dependent on funding from the \nCongress.\n    Senator Grassley. All right. Then take out the word IRS and \nput in place of it the Treasury Department officials. Is this a \nbattle that you have within the bureaucracy, getting resources? \nAre you always told, well, Congress just does not give us \nenough money?\n    Mr. Patsalides. Mr. Calahan, do you want to answer that?\n    Senator Grassley. It is all right with me if you answer.\n    Mr. Calahan. Thank you, Senator. The amount of resources we \nhave is obviously a function of the budget process. That goes \nthrough several levels of review, the department, the OMB, and \nthe Congress.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Senator Grassley, from my standpoint in the \nOffice of Investigations, all our investigations are done \nprofessionally and with high quality. I demand that of our \ninvestigators. The problem is, we have too many significant \nallegations and not enough staff to investigate all those \nallegations.\n    We will never have enough staff to investigate all of the \nallegations, but the more significant ones, the ones we feel we \nshould be involved with, we cannot even do, therefore, we are \nforced to refer many of these allegations back to IRS \nmanagement for resolution.\n    When we do, we do request that they respond back to us with \nthe results of their review, but we are unable to do those \nourselves independently of IRS.\n    Senator Grassley. Mr. Chairman, I guess my time is up.\n    The Chairman. That is right.\n    Senator Grassley. Thank you.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Grassley.\n    We will now call on Senator Kerrey, please."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Mr. Patsalides, you described, and then later identified, \ntwo significant issues. One, is your authority and the other is \nthe problems that are associated with alleged inadequate or \ndisparate discipline.\n    You have identified it as a problem, as well as alleged \nsexual harassment and racial discrimination as issues that are \nnot being addressed.\n    What I would like to direct your attention to--in fact, all \nof the witnesses attention to--is the legislation as passed by \nthe House and as passed by this committee dealing, first of \nall, with the Inspector General, second dealing with a new \nboard that will have significant authority and \nresponsibilities, and last, dealing with new powers and \nauthorities granted to the Commissioner.\n    I have got to say at the beginning, my own view is that, \nunless and until just sort of common sense judgments are made--\nI appreciate you are going to get back to the committee on what \nhappens if somebody sends a letter out threatening action \nagainst an individual, a taxpayer or somebody helping the \ntaxpayer comply with the law, but I have got to say, you should \nnot have to--you say, oh, yes, Senator, we are going to go back \nto the office and we are going to check on that one. I do not \nknow what additional authority you need. It troubles me. I just \nwill take this right up the food chain to Mr. Rossotti.\n    It seems to me that we have got to take immediate action \nwhen something like that happens and people have to know, as we \ndo in other areas of the law, that you are going to pay a \npenalty for doing it, otherwise it continues. I mean, that is \nthe problem with lax enforcement of any law, is it encourages \nother people to say, well, there is no punishment, there is no \npenalty, why worry about it?\n    I would like for you to comment, rather, on the specific \nprovisions. You are saying you have identified a number of \nthings. The IRS does not refer complaints about high-level \nemployees, the IRS has been slow in taking administrative \naction, the IG views some adjudicative actions taken by the IRS \nagainst high-level employees as weak decisions, and so on.\n    In the legislation, both the House and Senate legislation, \nwe significantly change the power and authorities of the \nInspector General. We shift over to Treasury, first of all, and \nmake the IG independent.\n    I wonder if you would comment on the legislation itself. I \npresume you have reviewed the legislation, both that as passed \nby the House and strengthened by this committee, and I wonder \nif you would comment as to whether or not the proposed change \nin the law that this committee is looking at will solve the \nproblems you are identifying. If not, what additional \nsuggestions would you make to this committee when we take it up \non the floor?\n    Mr. Patsalides. I would make a personal observation. The \nproposed legislation that I viewed calls for two independent \nOffice of Inspector Generals within the Treasury Department. I \nbelieve that that is not necessary.\n    I believe that one Office of Inspector General within the \nTreasury Department, one independent IG overseeing all the \nbureaus including IRS, is more workable. The problem is that if \nthat was proposed, we would need the sufficient resources to be \nable to oversee the operations of IRS."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Under the bill that was passed out by this \ncommittee, the Treasury IG has all the current \nresponsibilities, but in addition it would assume all the \nduties and responsibility currently delegated at the IRS Office \nof Chief Inspector. Is that adequate?\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir, I believe so. I am not familiar \nwith that."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Well, I would appreciate it if you would \nreview that because we are about to change the law. One of the \nthings that is awfully difficult in solving problems, is if we \ndo not connect the problem with the law, again, I emphasize the \nIRS is not Sears and Roebuck.\n    We are not talking about a private sector entity here, we \nare talking about an agency that grows from the law. We have to \npay attention to how we write that law and pay attention to the \ncircumstances that you are identifying here and try to change \nit by changing the law. Again, in parentheses, some of the \nstuff the law cannot provide for.\n    I should not need a law that says that somebody gets \nterminated if they write a letter out threatening a citizen as \na consequence of something he said publicly. I mean, if we have \nto have a law for that, we have got trouble. I should not have \nto have you go back and check it out and see what you are going \nto do about it.\n    Mr. Patsalides. The other situation was brought to our \nattention as a result of this meeting."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    I appreciate that. But there are a lot of \nthings----\n    Mr. Patsalides. We do not have that kind of oversight over \nIRS when they do their investigations. That is one of the \nproblems right now, they do their own investigations. We do not \nhave sufficient resources to oversee everything they do."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    I appreciate that. I do not think you have \na sufficient amount of authority, I think you need to be \nindependent, I think you need to be in Treasury, I think the \nissue of resources is important. What I am saying is, even \nwithout resources judgments have to be made about what people \nare doing, whether they are right or wrong.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    It seems to me that if I have got evidence \nthat somebody has sent a letter out threatening a taxpayer or \nsomebody that is helping them prepare their taxes, I do not \nneed a law to tell me that is wrong and they ought to be \nterminated. I mean, if you need a law for that, it seems to me \nthat we are never going to get where we want to go.\n    Mr. Patsalides. I agree, sir."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    If you have got to go back and check that \nall out and come back to us----\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    If somebody steals 20 cars, somebody \nsexually harasses employees, should not be promoted to be in \ncharge of EEO for the whole agency.\n    Mr. Patsalides. We certainly agree."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    So why does it happen? Why do you get to \nthis point where you are coming here and saying sort of lamely \nthat we will go back and check it out?\n    Mr. Calahan. Senator, could I make a clarifying point? Our \noffice typically investigates grade 15s and up, higher level \nemployees."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Yes.\n    Mr. Calahan. I believe that the employee involved in this \nmatter was not at that level, and so I do not think we became \naware of that issue until it was brought to our attention."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Well, I appreciate that. My red light is on \nand I will take up some of the personal items in the second \nround. But I hope you will review the legislation and tell us \nwhether or not the problems you are identifying will be solved \nby the bill that was reported out by this committee.\n    I think it does, by the way. As I hear your testimony, I \nthink in both cases the problems are going to be solved. But \nplease pay attention to the law, because I think it matters a \ngreat deal.\n    Mr. Calahan. We would really be happy to provide you \ncomments on the new bill."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Thank you.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Kerrey's time is up. Mr. Breaux has to \nleave to make a speech.\n    I would just make one observation. Obviously, what we write \ninto the law in addressing these problems are of critical \nimportance. I would also note that I think they make clear the \nimportance of management changes as well. It is not just a \nmatter of revising the law, but assuring that there are people \nwho will faithfully pursue the law as it is written.\n    With that, I would like to call on Senator Nickles.\n    Senator Nickles. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Again, \nthese hearings are kind of shocking. Correct me if I am wrong. \nI did not catch all these stories. But one individual was \nresponsible for stealing 20 cars and he is still an IRS \nemployee; did I hear that correctly?\n    Mr. Patsalides. No, sir. He is no longer an IRS employee.\n    Senator Nickles. Was he fired or did he retire?\n    Mr. Patsalides. I believe he retired or left, resigned, \nbefore termination.\n    Senator Nickles. Any criminal penalties whatsoever?\n    Mr. Patsalides. That was the issue where the person \nreceived a deferred prosecution and was placed on two years' \nprobation and had to repay the government the $20,000.\n    Senator Nickles. Twenty thousand dollars. Most cars, that \nis pretty light. His restitution was $20,000 and he stole 20 \ncars?\n    Mr. Patsalides. The person may not have stolen all 20 cars. \nIt was documented that he misappropriated at least two or three \nof the vehicles. But, because of the inadequate controls of \nthat office, they could not determine the disposition of the \nother vehicles under his control.\n    Senator Nickles. That is pathetic.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir, it is.\n    Senator Nickles. An 18-year-old steals a car in Washington, \nDC could go to jail for years. And I do not want to paint all \nof our IRS employees with the same brush that implies that, but \nthat is criminal conduct. To get off with 2 years' probation \nand to pay $20,000 restitution when you may have 20 cars that \nwere stolen, is just a pat on the back. That is embarrassing.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Those issues were handled in the courts and \nnot by the agency, either IRS or the Treasury OIG. They were \nadjudicated by the Department of Justice, and that was the end \nresult.\n    Senator Nickles. By the U.S. Attorney.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir.\n    Senator Nickles. Or Assistant U.S. Attorney.\n    Let me ask you another question. You mentioned somebody had \nseveral sexual harassment charges filed against him and was or \nis in charge of EEOC for the IRS; is that correct?\n    Mr. Patsalides. He was, yes, sir.\n    Senator Nickles. He was until when?\n    Mr. Patsalides. I do not have the exact date, but he is no \nlonger in that position. I believe he was removed maybe about 6 \nto 8 months ago.\n    Senator Nickles. Six to 8 months ago. But several of these \ncharges were filed against him.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Several charges were filed against him \nbefore he even obtained that position.\n    Senator Nickles. Yet he still obtained the position to be \nhead of EEOC with the IRS.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir. Then subsequent allegations \nfollowed him, then he was removed from that position.\n    Senator Nickles. Removed from that position, but he is \nstill a current employee.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir.\n    Senator Nickles. One individual on this letter that we saw, \ndo you know which individual that was? I mean, you said it was \nnot investigated quite as thoroughly as you had hoped it \npossibly should be.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir. In reviewing the report of \ninvestigation by the Office of Inspections, the allegation is \nlisted as ``Not Substantiated.''\n    Senator Nickles. Are you pretty sure who the individual was \nthat had typed that note?\n    Mr. Patsalides. No, sir, I am not. But I believe that \npotentially additional investigation might help to determine \nthat.\n    Senator Nickles. Will there be additional investigation?\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir. We have committed to meet with \nthe Office of Inspections. If they do not want to do it, we are \ngoing to do it.\n    Senator Nickles. You mentioned one other case where an IRS \nagent was stopped by a policeman and threatened the policeman \nwith an audit. Is that IRS agent still employed?\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir, he is.\n    Senator Nickles. Should he not be terminated for that abuse \nof power?\n    Mr. Patsalides. Again, sir, that is part of the \nadjudication process and there are many factors that are \ninvolved in that. We do not normally get involved in the \nadjudication process. Our job is to gather the facts and \npresent them in a report of investigation to management for \nappropriate action.\n    Senator Nickles. Well, just a couple of comments. In these \nfour cases I have cited, I guess nobody was fired. One person \nwas moved. This is a real lack of control.\n    I understand your job is to do the investigation, but IRS \nhas a hard time firing people. I know in the cases in Oklahoma \nwhere we had real abuses, and you mentioned that you are \ninvestigating those and I do not know that we have time to get \ninto it, but to my knowledge no one was fired. We had one \ndistrict director who retired early and went to Texas. One \nperson moved. Did not want to testify for our hearing, frankly. \nBut to my knowledge, there was no real disciplinary action. We \nstill have IRS employees that say they are being harassed \nbecause they participated in the hearing.\n    Ms. DesJardins has mentioned the fact that she, as what I \nam going to say is a whistle blower, somebody who is presenting \nsome facts, is taking a risk and has the courage to do it--and \nI compliment you for doing it because I know that is not easy. \nI know you can be ostracized. That is what I am hearing from \npeople that testified in Oklahoma.\n    So I am concerned, one, that the IRS never fires anybody \nand seems to be very cliquish, and the fact that we are going \nto keep all this hush-hush and keep our power and keep \neverything private within their own house.\n    Frankly, as I said before, most IRS employees, I think, are \nfine, outstanding public servants, but you have got some that \nneed to be fired. Obviously there has been a reluctance to do \nthat, either by tradition or by inept management, and I think \nthat has to change.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Senator Nickles, the issues about the \ninvestigation that you mentioned where some people retired, \nthat is still open and it is before a review panel right now \nwho will recommend appropriate action against as many \nindividuals as they determine warrant action.\n    Senator Nickles. Can you also assure me that people will \nnot be retaliated against, are you checking into that, because \nthey participated in a Congressional hearing?\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir. We are still currently conducting \nthat investigation. It is still open and we will report back to \nyou when it is completed.\n    Senator Nickles. Thank you very much.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Nickles.\n    Senator Mack.\n    Senator Mack. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    I want to ask Mr. Patsalides about Treasury Directive 40-\n01. As I understand it, that requires the immediate referral of \nallegations involving senior officials and employees of \nInternal Affairs and Inspection Offices and that the IRS has \nviolated this directive. Is that correct?\n    Mr. Patsalides. The directive does require immediate \nreferral and there have been instances where referrals were not \nimmediately made.\n    Senator Mack. Do you consider that a problem?\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir, we do. We have a current review \nthat our Office of Oversight is conducting to help address that \nissue and report back to us.\n    Senator Mack. All right. Frankly, that does not help me \nmuch. I am kind of surprised that a specific directive could be \nviolated, and you do consider it to be a concern. How long has \nthis been going on? I guess I got the impression, too, that \nthis is something that happens. It is not an unusual occurrence \nfor it to happen.\n    Mr. Patsalides. I think for the most part we timely receive \nthe referrals, occasionally we do not. However, there is no way \nto tell----\n    Senator Mack. When you find out that there has been a \ndelay, what responsibility do you have? Who should you be \nreporting this to? If you do you report it to somebody, do they \ntake action? If they do not take action, why do they not take \naction?\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir, we do. We identify it and report \nit to the appropriate officials.\n    Senator Mack. And who would be the appropriate official?\n    Mr. Patsalides. The Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner of \nIRS.\n    Senator Mack. And the Deputy Commissioner does not react?\n    Mr. Calahan. I should point out that these are two current \nmatters. The first obligation of our office is to investigate \nthe issue and determine the seriousness of the matter, and then \ndetermine who it should be reported to.\n    The Chairman. I think the question was directed at Mr. \nPatsalides.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Pardon me, sir?\n    The Chairman. I think the question was directed to you.\n    Senator Mack. I think he is suggesting that maybe you \nanswer the question as well.\n    Mr. Patsalides. I have been given some information that \nindicates the OIG completed a review of 40-01 and they are \ngoing to be making recommendations as to how we can better work \nthose. They said they have made recommendations. That is our \nOffice of Oversight, and I am not familiar with that. However, \nwhenever we run across these situations we do provide them to \nthe attention, as I told you, of the appropriate officials.\n    Senator Mack. Let me ask you this. This was in your \ntestimony that I have read that from.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir.\n    Senator Mack. You obviously consider it to be a problem \nworth noting.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir, it is.\n    Senator Mack. Are you implying anything with respect to the \nfailure to immediately notify? I mean, is it, in essence, being \nused? Are people keeping information from you, putting it in a \ndrawer, keeping it out of your view? Is there some pattern that \nyou have been able to determine; are people using it to avoid \nhaving to pursue wrongdoing?\n    Mr. Patsalides. We have not seen a pattern, but we have \nseen it on some significant issues that raised concerns.\n    Senator Mack. Would you tell me what those issues are and \nwhat concerns they raised?\n    Mr. Patsalides. As Mr. Calahan mentioned, we have some open \nissues right now, and the examples that we used were open, so I \nam not able to discuss those right now. However, we are \nplanning on addressing that the next time we talk with IRS.\n    Senator Mack. I have this feeling I am just kind of being \nleft out there. I mean, I understand the point that you are \ntrying to make, but I am very uncomfortable with this response. \nIs there not some way we can get more information now? I mean, \nthis was in your testimony.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir. The examples are factual. What \nyou are now trying--since it is an ongoing investigation, we \nmay be----\n    Senator Mack. Let me move off of that for a second.\n    Mr. Patsalides. I do not want to compromise anything \nregarding that and that is why I am hedging.\n    Senator Mack. All right.\n    Mr. Patsalides. The issue that you raised is a valid issue \nand it does give us concern. The other issue is, since it is a \nvoluntary system, we have no way to know whether they comply \nwith 40-01 or not. We do not know how many times allegations \nhave come to the attention of managers or employees and they \nfail to provide them to the Office of Inspector General. There \nis no way to control that.\n    Senator Mack. But you are not suggesting that these two \nmatters that you say are under investigation now, that this is \nthe only times that this has occurred.\n    Mr. Patsalides. No, sir, it has not.\n    Senator Mack. Were these unusual?\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir. They were significant ones.\n    Senator Mack. Can you give me a sense of the timing of when \nthese occurred?\n    Mr. Patsalides. In one issue I think it was several months, \nmaybe 5 or 6 months after the incident occurred.\n    Senator Mack. And how long ago? When did you begin this \ninvestigation?\n    Mr. Patsalides. That was recent. I am really reluctant to \nanswer some of those because I do not want to compromise what \nwe are doing.\n    Senator Mack. All right. Mr. Chairman, I would just ask \nthat the committee be kept informed. I understand the concern \nabout, I guess, divulging information while there is an ongoing \ninvestigation, but----\n    The Chairman. I think your request is a reasonable one, and \nwe direct the witness to keep us advised.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir. I would be happy to.\n    Senator Mack. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Senator Conrad."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    First of all, in this last round, I would just say I think \nit is a little questionable that we are talking about cases \nthat are not completed. I am fully prepared to hold the agency \nresponsible for failing to deal with circumstances where \nsomebody has been proven to have been dealing in wrongful acts, \nbut when you have an ongoing case where apparently the final \ndecision has not been made, it seems to me we have the cart \nbefore the horse. That does not make much sense to me.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Senator Conrad, the issue here is the \ntimely referral. In those situations were used as examples for \nfailure to get timely referral. However, we cannot document \nthat until we complete the investigative matter."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    That is what I am saying. If you cannot \ndocument it, then I do not think it is time to talk about it. \nLet us deal with things that are documented. This committee has \ngot to deal with facts, things that have happened, not things \nthat in process. We cannot make a judgment on that until the \nprocess is completed. If we cannot document it, then we ought \nto move on and talk about things that are documented.\n    I would like to go to this question of the person that \nwas----\n    Mr. Patsalides. I think we can provide some documentation \nof closed cases, sir. It is just going to take some research."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Yes. Well, that is what we need to deal \nwith. The fellow that dealt with the 20 stolen cars that we now \nfind out is not 20, maybe it is 2 or 3, I would like to know \nexactly, he misappropriated cars. What did he do with them, did \nhe use them for his own use, did he sell them; what did he do \nwith these cars? What do we actually know that he did? What is \ndocumented?\n    Mr. Patsalides. Well, we know that there were approximately \n20 cars that were unaccounted for."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Approximately 20?\n    Mr. Patsalides. We know that there were 20 cars unaccounted \nfor. What we do not know, because of the lack of controls that \nthe office had, is exactly what happened to those."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Well, what do we know? We know about two or \nthree cars.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Again, this is an IRS Inspection report \nwhere we reviewed the file, so we did not conduct this \ninvestigation ourselves. We just depended on the information in \nthe file to find the final adjudication action. If you want us \nto research every----"
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    But what do we know? You indicated earlier \nthat two or three cars were misappropriated, that you know that \noccurred; is that correct? Well, how did he misappropriate \ncars? What did he do with them? I am trying to determine if the \npenalty here is appropriate or not.\n    Mr. Patsalides. We know that at least two, maybe three cars \nwere used for personal use. The other cars may just have been--\n--"
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    You mean, on an ongoing basis or just \ntemporarily? You mean, he took these cars home.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    And these were cars that were seized in IRS \noperations.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir. Most of them were."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    And he took these cars and used them for \nhis personal use.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    That person paid a $20,000 fine.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Then what happened to him?\n    Mr. Patsalides. He entered into this plea agreement where \nhe got a deferred prosecution and 2 years' probation."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Was he removed from service? He retired, \napparently, during this time.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    He retired. And he paid the $20,000?\n    Mr. Patsalides. He either retired or resigned, but he left \nthe IRS so they could not take any action against him."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    All right. Thank you very much.\n    Ms. DesJardins, you indicated there were cases where travel \nfraud occurred, yet the employees in question were not \npunished; is that correct?\n    Ms. DesJardins. That is correct."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Can you tell us the nature of the travel \nfraud? I am not asking for names here, I am asking, what did \nthe person in question do?\n    Ms. DesJardins. One of the issues involved travel of a \nnumber of IRS managers to a meeting and the individuals were \npermitted to stay overnight, which is all right. However, there \nwere also managers that were in the local area that were \nallowed to stay overnight in the same hotel at government \nexpense. The purpose of them staying overnight was to \nparticipate in social activities at the government's expense.\n    When the issue came forward, the individual stated that \nthere was no knowledge or that it did not violate the travel \nregulations to have authorized these other managers to stay \novernight.\n    It was proven that it did violate the travel regulations, \nso this person was required to ask for a waiver of the funds. \nIn asking for the waiver of the funds, which was required to be \napproved by the Commissioner, this person did not provide \naccurate information to the Commissioner as to why the \nsituation occurred."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Do both the matters of travel fraud involve \nthat fact pattern?\n    Ms. DesJardins. No, sir."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    What was the other travel fraud matter?\n    Ms. DesJardins. The other one involved an individual using \ncompanion tickets for travel. Government tickets, government \nbonus tickets, and using them for companion travel."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    The case where an IRS employee abused his \nemployees.\n    Ms. DesJardins. Yes."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    What was the nature of the abuse?\n    Ms. DesJardins. The abuses ranged from, this person would \nharass employs, this person would require the employees to do a \nlot of personal business for the individual, just overall \nharassment and demanding things that normally an employee \nshould not be required to do."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Personal business for the manager?\n    Ms. DesJardins. Correct."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    What kind of personal business?\n    Ms. DesJardins. If I recall, in one instance, picking up \nsome music sheets. I do not recall anything else."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    All right. My time has expired. I thank the \nChairman.\n    The Chairman. Senator Lott."
"lott","Senator Lott","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Ms. DesJardins, thank you very much for being willing to \ncome forward and give the statement that you have given. I have \nbeen going back and going over it. It looks to me like you have \ntestified here today that IRS managers and high-level employees \nhave committed the following: travel fraud, abusing and \nmistreating subordinates, lying to the Commissioner, sexual \nharassment, general fraud, processing illegal performance \nawards, telling a subordinate to lie, time and attendance \nfraud, lying to investigators, and lying to Commissioners.\n    Now, that is a long and devastating list. It also appears \nthat only the last two resulted in some minor action of \npunishment, although there were a variety of things that \napparently did occur here.\n    Now, each of these cases have been substantiated by the \nInspector General or the Office of Special Counsel, yet nothing \nor very little has happened. Who is protecting these people? \nWho is not causing actions to occur when these allegations are \nsubstantiated? Where is the problem? I am not asking for a \nname, necessarily, but give us some idea of why and how these \nmatters are not being appropriately pursued.\n    Ms. DesJardins. I think when these actions involve high-\nlevel individuals in the organization they are protected up at \nthe Deputy Commissioner's Office."
"lott","Senator Lott","lott","Senator Lott","    Who is the Deputy Commissioner?\n    Ms. DesJardins. Mr. Dolan."
"lott","Senator Lott","lott","Senator Lott","    And this is a pattern, apparently, that has \nbeen going on for quite some time; is that correct?\n    Ms. DesJardins. Yes, sir."
"lott","Senator Lott","lott","Senator Lott","    How long have you been at IRS?\n    Ms. DesJardins. Since 1991."
"lott","Senator Lott","lott","Senator Lott","    And on several instances you have brought \nthese problems to the attention of appropriate officials and \nyou feel like inadequate, inappropriate, or no action has \nresulted.\n    Ms. DesJardins. Correct."
"lott","Senator Lott","lott","Senator Lott","    I know this is not easy for any of you, but I \nthink it is important that we have this testimony. You are \nsubstantiating what the American people have been feeling for a \ngood, long while and what we have suspected and now we are \nhearing specific examples.\n    Now, Mr. Patsalides, in your statement on page 9 you state \nthat the IRS has failed to timely refer complaints to your \noffice. Senator Mack has been asking about that. They have been \nslow to take administrative action against certain employees, \nand some adjudicative actions taken by the IRS were weak \ndecisions.\n    When you say slow to take administrative action against \ncertain employees, what do you mean? You talked a little bit \nabout, slow to take it out of a drawer and get it in the \nappropriate place, but I have the impression it is more than \nthat, that it is slow to be acted on, or weak actions have \noccurred once decisions are made.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir. Even when allegations have been \nsubstantiated, prompt administrative action has not been taken."
"lott","Senator Lott","lott","Senator Lott","    What is the solution here? Do we not have a \nproper process to follow through or is this just a matter of \npeople, individuals? I mean, if we had different people in \nthese positions would it be different, or is this a culture \nthat has developed that leads to no, or weak, administrative \nactions?\n    Mr. Calahan. Senator, I would like to respond."
"lott","Senator Lott","lott","Senator Lott","    Mr. Calahan, please.\n    Mr. Calahan. I would like to point out that I met \npersonally with the Commissioner on this matter of slow \ndecisions and he seemed to be genuinely distressed over that \nmatter. I really believe that that is something that he is \ngoing to be very active about."
"lott","Senator Lott","lott","Senator Lott","    Well, he certainly needs to.\n    One last question, Mr. Chairman. On pages 10 and 11 of your \nstatement, Mr. Patsalides, you talk about access to taxpayer \ninformation. Senator Moseley-Braun and I have been concerned \nthat the IRS is using taxpayer confidentiality, commonly \nreferred to as the 6103 information, as an excuse to hinder \nyour investigation and inquiries.\n    We have some language, I believe, in the bill that would, \nexcept for the name, address, and information that could be \nused to identify the individual, make that information \navailable to this oversight group that we have. Now, is that a \nhinder to the investigations and inquiries?\n    Mr. Patsalides. The lack of 6103 authority is, yes, sir."
"lott","Senator Lott","lott","Senator Lott","    So you feel that opening it up in the way we \nhave proposed could be helpful.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Extremely. Yes, sir."
"lott","Senator Lott","lott","Senator Lott","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Lott.\n    Senator Gramm?\n    Senator Gramm. Mr. Chairman, let me say, having sat here \nand listened to this hearing and having sat through the \nhearings that we had prior to our bill, I think it is obvious \nto a blind man that our problem here is the old Greek adage \nthat power corrupts.\n    Our problem is, we have an agency that has virtually no \nchecks and balances and an agency which basically protects its \nown against the public. I am very proud of the bill that we \nhave written, Mr. Chairman, but there is one area that we have \nnot been able to deal with which greatly concerns me, and that \nis the absence of checks and balances.\n    In the criminal justice system, basically the police do the \ninvestigation and they turn their information over to the \nprosecutor, and, in evaluating the evidence, the prosecutor \ninvariably oversees and evaluates what the police did, so you \nget a check on abuse.\n    Then the prosecutor has got to go before a grand jury, \nwhere again you get a check and a balance. Then you go into a \ncourt, if the dispute continues or a crime was committed, and \nyou got independent jurors and you have got generally an \nelected judge, so you have got a division of power and checks \nand balances. It is the genius of our system. Yet, with the IRS \nwe literally have the investigator, the prosecutor, the judge, \nthe jury, all in the same agency with no checks and no \nbalances.\n    So maybe we are surprised that all of this is happening, \nbut I think anybody who understands how organizations work \nwould have predicted exactly this kind of problem. I do not \nthink there is an easy or pretty face you can put on the fact \nthat the Chief of Employee and Labor Relations Section of the \nPersonnel Branch of the General Counsel's Office at the IRS \nraises all of these potential violations of the law and nothing \nhappens.\n    How are we to conclude anything else other than, nothing is \nhappening because the Internal Revenue Service is protecting \npeople who are violating the law and who are treating citizens \nin a way that, at least we claim, we will not tolerate. I do \nnot understand how somebody threatens to audit somebody and \nthey are not fired on the spot. I mean, I just do not get it.\n    Let me ask, since we have the Deputy Inspector General and \nwe have the Assistant Inspector General, in the last 10 years, \nhow many people has the Internal Revenue Service actually \nfired? You have 100,000 employees. So if we were looking at the \nprivate sector, I would say you would have maybe 1 out of 100, \nmaybe 1,000. How many people have been fired by the Internal \nRevenue Service in the last 10 years?\n    Mr. Calahan. Senator, I do not think we know that, but we \nwould be happy to get that for you for the record.\n    Senator Gramm. Well, I would like to know. This committee \nhas raised this question now many times. How many people in the \nlast 10 years have been fired as a result of wrongdoing and how \nmany people in the last 5 years have been fired as a result of \nwrongdoing?\n    We would like the actual number of people, not who have \nretired or that have come back to the system after somebody \nraised an objection to what they have done. But to how many \npeople have you actually said, you are fired, get out of here? \nWe would like to know that number. It seems to me that that \nnumber is something we ought to be comparing to other \ngovernment agencies and it is a number we ought to be comparing \nto the private sector.\n    I think, Mr. Chairman, these are very important hearings. I \nthink we have taken a major step toward dealing with abuse, but \nI think there is this final area that is virtually untouched by \nour legislation, and that is our failure to separate out these \nmassive powers as prosecutor, judge, jury, investigator all \nwrapped in one that the Internal Revenue Service has. It is \nthis power that is the problem. It is not the people, in my \nopinion.\n    Having all the sociology professors in the country come in \nand give sensitivity training is not going to solve this \nproblem. The problem is, power corrupts. People have got too \nmuch power. It seems to me that maybe this ought to be phase \ntwo of what we should be doing, is looking at trying to find a \nsystem of checks and balances.\n    And I know you guys have a terrible job sitting here, \npeople yelling at you and trying to answer questions that just, \nhonest to God, cannot be answered. But it is clear that these \nabuses are occurring and nobody is doing anything about it. I \nthink that is obvious.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Gramm."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","lott","Senator Lott","    Could I just say to my colleague from \nTexas, we do have a table here that has been provided to us on \ninvoluntary separations. They seem to range from, in fiscal \n1995 it was 902 out of a total of employees of 126,000. Then it \nwent to 1,256 in fiscal 1996 then up to 1,856 in fiscal 1997. \nPerhaps you could help us with that, because the Senator raises \na perfectly straightforward question.\n    Mr. Calahan. We would be happy to do that.\n    The Chairman. Next, we will call on Senator Moseley-Braun."

"","","moynihan","Senator Moynihan"," OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CAROL MOSELEY-BRAUN, A U."
break,break,break,break
"","","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Senator Moseley-Braun. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n    To my colleague, I think one of the most important checks \nthat we have, because I think we are all in this together and \nlooking for some results here, is these women who have come \nforward, the whistleblowers on the system, because when you \nhave employees inside of the agency who are willing to step up, \nto put themselves at risk to take on the challenge of being a \ntattletale, we used to call them in school. That takes a lot of \ncourage. It takes an awful lot of courage. When I first came in \nI recognized Ms. Long from the last hearings.\n    Frankly, in the testimony I thought the response regarding \nher testimony was a little oblique in that it says, ``It cannot \nbe concluded that IRS managers do not harass or retaliate \nagainst employees in the Houston district or other districts,'' \nand that was in response to Ms. Long's testimony about \nharassment and retaliation and people getting back at employees \nwho had come forward.\n    Ms. DesJardins essentially testified the same way in \nregards to retaliation and harassment inside of the agency, and \nthat employees who come forward, the whistleblowers, the people \nwho resist the corruption in the culture, get punished by their \ncolleagues.\n    That is really awful because I think, instead of those \nemployees being punished, they ought to be applauded and \nencouraged, or even promoted, for what they are doing because I \nthink that whistleblowers, people who are inside the agencies, \nperform an important function in that they provide an important \ninternal check on the abuse of power that Senator Gramm was \ntalking about on the mistreatment of other taxpayers and on \nconduct unbecoming a public servant.\n    So I just have two congratulations. One, I want to \ncongratulate the Chairman for this second set of hearings. I \nknow, Mr. Chairman, it was controversial to go to the second \nset of hearings, but I think it is important that we perform \nour role in providing oversight and providing a safety valve on \nthe agencies. I think I want to congratulate also these women \nand the other employees who have come forward and helped us \nwith this whole set of examinations of the agency, because it \nis not a negative thing. It is not a bad thing for the service.\n    I was looking at a quote here, and I am going to quote it \nbefore I go on and ask my question, from the head of the \nIntelligence Unit, Mr. Elmer Irey, who back in 1919 said, \n``When engaged in common endeavor, a group no less an \nindividual needs occasionally, for the good of its soul and in \nthe interest of its efficiency, to review and appraise its \norigin, its objectives, and its progress and development.\n    So I think really that this oversight is that kind of a \nreview that can be good for the service if people will not just \nresist it, but rather will kind of go with it and give \nthemselves over to it and understand the message that is being \ncommunicated here.\n    I think a major part of the communication here has to do \nwith what it is we do to provide the checks and balances that \nSenator Gramm is talking about. While on the one hand this \nconversation that we are having and the sunshine that it gives \nto the operations of the service will help and we have a bill \nin place which will hopefully take us a long way and help, at \nthe same time I think I still have a concern regarding what, if \nanything, is being done to protect those employees who want to \nhelp the agency to do the right thing.\n    What steps are being taken right now? There is an ongoing \ninternal change directive by Mr. Rossotti in terms of \nreinventing the agency and changing the culture of the agency, \nbut what steps are currently being taken, Mr. Patsalides, to \nprotect those employees who have come forward, those, to use \nthe term, whistleblowers, tattletales, whatever you want to \ncall them, the people who have, I think, helped to inject this \nvery important element of internal sunshine on the operations \nof the agency?\n    What is being done to protect them in the first instance, \nand second, what additional steps or what steps would you \nrecommend to protect employees who are, again, trying to get \nthe agency to do the right thing, who are prepared to step \nforward, again, in very courageous ways to take on the \nchallenge of restoring the respect that the agency has got to \nhave if it is going to function appropriately?\n    Mr. Calahan. Senator, if I may respond to at least part of \nthat. The Inspector General Act allows for employees to make \ndisclosures of fraud, waste, and mismanagement to the Inspector \nGeneral either anonymously or with confidentiality requested. \nIf they request confidentiality, we do not provide their names \nto anyone and it stays with us.\n    We certainly would follow up with any allegations of \nreprisal taken against employees that provide us information. \nHowever, the Office of Special Counsel has primary jurisdiction \nin that area.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. Mr. Patsalides, your written \ntestimony does not say that. Maybe I gave too little of the \nsentence. It says, ``In addition, Long alleged that IRS \nmanagers harass and retaliate against IRS employees.'' It goes \non, ``Although the report does not substantiate her specific \nallegations of harassment, it cannot be concluded that IRS \nmanagers do not harass or retaliate against employees.''\n    Mr. Patsalides. That is correct. As a result of Jennifer \nLong's testimony and our investigation, we have gained \nsufficient information to initiate, I think it is, up to six \nadditional investigations right now.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. Investigations of managers harassing \nemployees?\n    Mr. Patsalides. Allegations that have been brought to our \nattention in connection with the Houston district.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. All right. So am I to discern from \nyour answer that you think the current procedures that are in \nplace to deal with harassment and retaliation are adequate or \nwould you recommend that there be additional procedures?\n    Mr. Patsalides. I think it would be premature now for us to \nmake any recommendations, and that is not normally what we do. \nWe investigate the facts and then provide our report of \ninvestigation with the facts. However, there are ongoing \ninvestigations and some do include those type of allegations.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. All right. As to the ongoing \ninvestigations, and again, looking at Mr. Rossotti's internal \nreview of the service, has your office or any other office made \nany recommendations to Mr. Rossotti regarding beefing up the \nprocedures for protecting whistleblowers? Have you paid any \nattention?\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, ma'am. One of the things that was \nbrought out in this investigation was that there were certain \npotential systemic weaknesses. Our normal process is to submit \na management implication report to the Commissioner identifying \nthose systemic weaknesses, which include the potential for \ndisclosing complainants' names.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. Well, just disclosing complainants' \nnames--and I do not mean to beat this horse, but it is a line \nthat follows. I am not just talking about disclosing the \ncomplainants' names, whether disclosed officially or not, if an \nemployee comes forward and that individual winds up being \nharassed and retaliated against, that is the conduct that I \nthink we have to protect against. I guess, again, I do not know \nwhy we are having such difficulty communicating here.\n    Are there procedures in place to protect the whistleblowers \nor, alternatively, have you made any further recommendations to \nprotect whistleblowers, given that the two that we have here \nare saying that the result of their action was to be harassed \nand retaliated against?\n    Mr. Patsalides. The procedures in place to protect \nwhistleblowers fall under the jurisdiction of the Office of \nSpecial Counsel. That is why I am having difficulty answering \nthat question. However, from a personal standpoint, we want to \ndo everything we can to protect whistleblowers from \nretaliation. One of the investigations we are conducting now, \nat the request of Senator Nickles, is an employee retaliation \ninvestigation.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. All right. I see my time is up. But \nMs. DesJardins, would you take a stab at that. Would you have \nsome recommendations in terms of what can or should be done to \nprotect whistleblowers?\n    Ms. DesJardins. I personally think that the Office of \nSpecial Counsel needs to become more involved and not view each \ncase as a case filed by a disgruntled employee and have an \nattempt to close it as quickly as possible.\n    I think that when the allegations are substantiated, the \nSpecial Counsel should become more involved in ensuring that \nthe appropriate actions are taken, which would include the \nprotection of the whistleblower.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. Thank you very much.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. I would say to the distinguished Senator that \nretaliation is a very, very serious question here and one that \nI think we are all going to have to work hard at finding a \nsolution for. Part of the answer, I think, has to be the \nongoing oversight by this committee because you need somebody \noutside as well as inside reviewing what is happening.\n    We will now call on Senator Hatch, which will bring this \nportion of the hearing to an end.\n    Senator Hatch?"
"hatch","Senator Hatch","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will not be long. \nI want to compliment you and the Ranking Member for your \ncontinuation of these hearings, and I want to thank each of you \nas witnesses for appearing here today and being as candid as \nyou have been.\n    I want to just follow up a little bit on our Leader Senator \nLott's question because, Ms. DesJardins, you said in your \ntestimony that many of the investigations ended up in the \nDeputy Commissioner's Office for a length of time with little \nor no action taken. Senator Lott, I think, brought that out \nwell.\n    But first tell me what, if any, is the current procedure or \nprocedures once an investigation gets to the Deputy \nCommissioner; do we have any procedures?\n    Ms. DesJardins. Yes, sir, we do."
"hatch","Senator Hatch","hatch","Senator Hatch","    And what are they?\n    Ms. DesJardins. Once the inquiry or the investigation has \ncome back in, normally after it comes back in from the field or \nthe region where it has been looked into the Regional \nCommissioner will make recommendations as to what type of \naction should take place.\n    When I receive the report I would do an analysis of the \nreport and all of the material that was included in the IG's \nreport, and I would then in turn summarize that and make a \nrecommendation to the Deputy Commissioner. Sometimes the \nrecommendation was consistent with what was recommended by the \nRegional Commissioner, other times it was not."
"hatch","Senator Hatch","hatch","Senator Hatch","    That is it, and then it is up to him to just \nmake a determination based upon your recommendation and the \nmaterials that you submit to him.\n    Ms. DesJardins. Yes, sir."
"hatch","Senator Hatch","hatch","Senator Hatch","    Can you recommend for us ways to prevent \ncases sitting for a prolonged period of time on someone's desk \nwithout any action? If you had the opportunity to really tell \nus what to do, what would we do?\n    Ms. DesJardins. I am not really sure. I think many times \nyou have an issue where an individual who is making the \ndecision should really recuse himself from handling that \naction. I think that lots of times that is really the problem, \nthat the person has an interest, personal friendship, or \nsomething like that with the individual.\n    So for me, I found many times that because that recusal did \nnot take place, that was the reason why the cases more or less \nlaid around and did not have final action taken on them."
"hatch","Senator Hatch","hatch","Senator Hatch","    Could I have any response from the other two \nwitnesses on these questions that I have asked?\n    Mr. Calahan. Senator, one thing that should be pointed out \nis that statistics are kept in terms of the aging of the laps \nof time for adjudicative decisions. Once an investigative case \nis provided to the IRS it goes into a system that keeps track \nof how old the case is. For example, we flag----"
"hatch","Senator Hatch","hatch","Senator Hatch","    Well, is there any printed record of that \nfor us to see?\n    Mr. Calahan. The statistics?"
"hatch","Senator Hatch","hatch","Senator Hatch","    Yes.\n    Mr. Calahan. Sure."
"hatch","Senator Hatch","hatch","Senator Hatch","    So we could see it.\n    Mr. Calahan. In fact, our Office of Oversight, as Mr. \nPatsalides was describing earlier, is in the process of testing \nthose numbers to make sure that they are correct, and we would \nbe happy to provide that report to this committee when it is \ncompleted."
"hatch","Senator Hatch","hatch","Senator Hatch","    I think that would be good. But could we \nhave regular reports on how these things are handled and how \ndelayed they are? I think this committee is interested, and our \ntwo leaders on this committee, are interested in the oversight \nfunctions of this committee. It seems to me, if we are having \nsomebody's desk piled up with things that are not being \nhandled, we ought to know about it.\n    Do you care to say anything, Mr. Patsalides?\n    Mr. Patsalides. No. I agree with that statement and I \nbelieve that more independent oversight of IRS is needed. The \nmost important aspect is to increase the accountability of \nmanagers."
"hatch","Senator Hatch","hatch","Senator Hatch","    Well, my time is just about up, but let me \njust say this to you. I think almost every agency has some of \nthese problems, but none of them, it seems to me, except the \nJustice Department perhaps, creates the concern on the part of \nour committees up here as much as yours and Justice.\n    We went so far as to have an independent counsel statute in \norder to try to resolve conflict of interest problems and to \npush things ahead and to make sure that there is no \npreferential treatment given to anybody under the law. Of \ncourse, as you know, that works and it does not work. Sometimes \nindependent counsel are not requested when they should be, \nsometimes they are requested when they should not. We find that \nworking and not working.\n    I guess one of the things I would like to have you stop and \nconsider, since you are as frustrated as we are on some of \nthese issues, is how might we work this with the IRS, because \nit is apparent that there is a good old boy system, it is \napparent that there are people who are afraid to take on their \ncolleagues, it is apparent that whistleblowers are being \nabused. I thought Senator Lott's long list of criminal activity \nthat he described was pretty significant. Frankly, these \nhearings are pointing it out to the whole of America.\n    Let me just close with this. Throughout the debate on IRS \nreform we have heard stories of abuse from IRS officials and \nemployees. Because there have been some bad apples in the \nbarrel, it would be easy to give the picture that all IRS \nemployees are like that and they are somehow mistreating the \ntaxpayers they serve. Of course, that is not true. The vast \nmajority of IRS employees are doing a good job.\n    But we hear enough of these complaints and enough of these \nhorror stories that literally we want to do something about it \nand we need your help to help us to know what to do. So I \npersonally have appreciated your testimony here today and look \nforward to any suggestions that you would care to make to the \ncommittee, or to any of us individually.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Hatch.\n    That will conclude the questioning of these witnesses."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","hatch","Senator Hatch","    Mr. Chairman?\n    The Chairman. I would say to the Senator from Nebraska, it \nis our intent to leave the panel open so that written questions \ncan be submitted."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Well, I would respectfully ask, I have \nwaited here and I abided by the 3-minute time limit, both in my \nopening statement and in my first round of questioning, and \nthat gives me 6 minutes total. I would just respectfully ask \nthat I be allowed to ask some additional follow up.\n    The Chairman. How long would the Senator need?"
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    I can be over in three minutes, as you \noriginally spoke of.\n    The Chairman. All right. Let us go ahead. We will give you \nthe three minutes."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    I thank the Chair.\n    Mr. Chairman, and I say to the panel, there is a pattern \nthat we have heard of personnel actions. There is another \npattern that concerns me, and that is, it seems like every half \na dozen years or so Congress gets outraged about what the IRS \nis doing and then issues press releases, and so forth.\n    This time around we have got a piece of legislation that \nhas advanced out of this committee. I say that because from \n1988 to 1993, the House Government Operations Committee held 4 \nor 5 years' worth of hearings leading to a report, leading to \nCommissioner Peterson saying, here is the action we are going \nto take.\n    I suspect during those hearings there were lots of members \nwho were expressing outrage about what is going on, and we have \ngot to do something about it, listening to the stories and \nsaying, by gosh, we are going to do something about it. It is a \nvery effective thing for us to do, to express our outrage. \nNobody emotes better than a member of Congress when they are \ndealing with somebody who has been abused by the IRS. I mean, I \ncan give you my maximum amount of sympathy.\n    The question is, are we going to change the law? I would \nask you to look at the law. And again, you do not have the \nadvantage of holding the law, but one of the things the House \ndid, and this committee strengthened, was the authority under \nTitle 5 of the Personnel Code to be able to take personnel \naction, additional flexibilities in providing awards, \nadditional flexibilities in being able to manage the agency, \nbut also very specifically the bill requires the IRS to \nterminate an employee for certain proven violations committed \nby the employee in connection with the performance of official \nduties.\n    There are six of them in total, and number six is \nviolations of Internal Revenue Code, Treasury regulations, or \npolicy of the IRS, including the Internal Revenue Manual for \nthe purpose of retaliating or harassing a taxpayer or other IRS \nemployee.\n    We have got a list of things in this piece of legislation, \nthis proposed change in the law, that would on the one hand \ngive the Commissioner the authority to manage in an affirmative \nway because if you have 100,000 employees, 95,000 of them are \ngoing to respond to positive incentives and not threats. So \ngive the Commissioner the authority to be able to manage the \nagency, but make it very explicit.\n    One of the things you are telling us here is, all you do is \ninvestigate and present it to the Department of Justice. This \nwould change the law, saying that if an IRS employee violates \nthe Internal Revenue Service Code and retaliates or harasses a \ntaxpayer or another IRS employee, either one, that is grounds \nfor immediate termination.\n    Now, does that not solve the problem that you all have \nbrought to us here this morning? So if we change the law to \ngive the Commissioner that kind of authority, that should solve \nthis problem.\n    At least, whenever this cycle repeats itself a half a dozen \nyears from now that will not be one of the things that we will \nbe expressing our outrage about and issuing our press releases \nand trying to raise money around, right? I mean, will it not \nsolve the problem, is the question I am trying to ask? It had \nbetter be yes, for God's sakes.\n    Mr. Calahan. I am not an expert in personnel law."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    If it is no, tell me. Again, it is painful \nto go through these things, especially when you look at the \nhistorical record. Congress has done this before.\n    There are Associated Press stories that show how these \nhearings are being used by some to raise money. I am outraged. \nI am going to do something about it. Fine. So run your mouth, \nrun your press releases, put out your fundraising letters, but \nnow it is time to change the law.\n    I hope that you will examine this law. All of you have \nexpressed a considerable amount of patience and courage to come \nbefore this committee, but we are talking about changing the \nlaw.\n    Remember, IRS has 535 members of its board of directors, it \nis called the Congress. Every single witness that we heard \nbefore the Restructuring Commission would say that Congress is \nthe biggest part of the problem.\n    But I will guarantee you, any hearing where we are going to \nexpress outrage, we are not going to say we are outraged about \nour own behavior, we are going to be outraged by your behavior.\n    I hope that you will help us as we move down the road to \nfinally changing the law, examine the changes that we are \nproposing, and ask the question if these changes are made. One \nof the changes in the Inspector General's Office is to ship 900 \nof your employees over to Treasury, leaving 300 in your shop.\n    You need to look at that language and give us a real, \nhonest evaluation of whether or not that is going to make it \nbetter or if it is going to make it worse, and help us write \nthe law so that it improves your operation and decreases the \nnumber of problems that we hear on a repetitive basis before \nthe Congress.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Senator Kerrey, I just want to make a \nclarification. We have a total of only 33 criminal \ninvestigators on our staff right now. We are not the Office of \nthe Chief Inspector, who has a staff of approximately 1,200, \nnot criminal investigator staff. I think approximately one-half \nof that is the criminal investigators."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    I just use that as exhibit A. You have \nunderscored my own ignorance, which is not unusual or atypical. \nI mean, that is the sort of response that we need in order, \nwhen we all stand down on the floor of the Senate.\n    My guess is, it is going to be 100 to nothing when this \nbill finally passes. It is going to be 100 to nothing, we are \nall going to put our press releases out, and we are all going \nto go back to our town hall meetings and say we solved the \nproblem. Help us make certain that we do as good a job as \npossible in solving this problem.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir. Thank you.\n    The Chairman. I would just make the observation that the \nsection quoted obviously is an attempt to address the problem \nof retaliation. It is not only a question of the law, of \ncourse, it is a question of it being enforced properly. It has \nto be enforced properly and not by a double standard, which we \nhear so much about today. So, there are those problems.\n    Well, I want to thank you for being here today. I know two \nof you feel you come here at great personal risk, and we find \nyour testimony was very helpful. We would appreciate any \nfurther comments you have to make.\n    I would point out for the benefit of the committee that we \nhave had requests from members who wish to address further \nquestions to the witnesses, so the record will be kept open. \nFurther questions can be provided on the panels today until \n5:00 today, and we would ask the witnesses to respond by \nThursday.\n     Again, I want to thank you very much for being here, as I \nsay, I know at great personal risk and sacrifice. We could not \nhold the hearings if it were not for people like you who are \nwilling to testify.\n    Thank you very much.\n    Mr. Patsalides. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Mr. Calahan. Thank you.\n    Ms. DesJardins. Thank you.\n    The Chairman. I would now like to welcome the members of \nour second panel. As practitioners of the law, these gentlemen \nappear before us today to tell us of the events they have both \nwitnessed and experienced involving the IRS, and offer this \ncommittee their insights regarding resolution of the many \nproblems they will identify.\n    The first witness is Mr. Robert E. Davis, who is an \nattorney with 40 years' experience with the firm of Hughes, \nLewes of Dallas, Texas. During the years 1982 and 1983, Mr. \nDavis served as Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Tax \nDivision of the Department of Justice. His expertise is in \nwhite collar crime, Federal tax controversies, and civil \nlitigation.\n    The second witness is Mr. Jay Earl Epstein, who is a lawyer \nwith 35 years' experience and member of the firm Epstein, \nShapiro & Epstein of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Mr. Epstein's \nexpertise is in tax, corporate real estate, and probate law.\n    Third, is Mr. Philip MacNaughton who has been in practice \nsince 1976. A portion of his practice is dedicated to \nrepresenting taxpayers before the IRS in tax controversies and \ncollection matters.\n    Fourth, Mr. Cody Mayo is currently Assistant District \nAttorney of the Caddo Parish in Louisiana. He is also a \ncertified public accountant with a law practice in Shreveport. \nMr. Mayo specializes in tax law and white collar crime.\n    Gentlemen, if you would please rise and raise your right \nhand."

break,break,break,break
"","","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Mr. Davis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and honorable members of \nthe committee. My name is Bob Davis. I am an attorney. I have \nbeen practicing law in Dallas, Texas for about 40 years.\n    During most of those years, the greatest part of my \npractice has been devoted to representing taxpayers in \nconnection with civil and criminal tax litigation and \ncontroversies with the Internal Revenue Service and with the \nDepartment of Justice.\n    During the years 1982 and 1983, however, I served as Deputy \nAssistant Attorney General in the Tax Division of the \nDepartment of Justice in Washington, DC. I was then responsible \nfor overseeing the functions of the Criminal Section and the \nReview Section of the Tax Division.\n    I think it would be fair to say that I have had as much \nexperience, probably, as any practitioner who has been \nrepresenting taxpayers over the last 40 years.\n    Tax collecting, as we all know, is an unpopular calling. \nIndeed, from biblical times to the present, there have been \nfew, or no, warmly regarded tax collectors, perhaps with the \nexception of Senator Conrad. Obviously he is warmly regarded.\n    But most of the employees of the Internal Revenue Service, \nas has been noted by the Chair and other members of this \ncommittee, are honorable, sincere, hardworking people doing \ntheir best to administer a very complex set of laws which were \nenacted by this Congress.\n    Notwithstanding those positive things, I think it is fair \nto say, in my personal experience, that all is not well with \nour tax system. I believe the Internal Revenue Service has, to \na significant extent, strayed from the proper path; second, \nthat there is excessive use and misuse of intrusive \ninvestigative techniques by the Criminal Investigation Division \nof the Internal Revenue Service; and third, there are sometimes \nserious integrity issues within the agency, but that the IRS \nInspection Service is simply not up to the task of \ninvestigating and correcting IRS agent misconduct when it does \noccur.\n    I would like to present my views on these subjects to the \ncommittee over the next several minutes, and then a \nsupplemental written statement.\n    Fifteen years ago when I was in the Tax Division, criminal \ntax enforcement practices were almost totally different than \nthey are today. At that time, undercover investigative \ntechniques were almost entirely unknown in criminal tax \nmatters.\n    At that time, search warrants were used in criminal tax \ncases only a dozen times in the course of an entire calendar \nyear, and grand jury investigations were a rare exception and \nadministrative investigations were the rule.\n    Today, that has dramatically changed and the use of these \nmuch more intimidating and intrusive techniques is commonly \nencountered. For example, search warrants are executed in \ncriminal tax investigations today some 20 times as frequently \nas they were then when I was in the Tax Division.\n    It is not surprising that these changes have occurred, as \nthe IRS CID has been increasingly used in the suppression of \ndrug and organized criminal activity. Its special agents have \nlearned the investigative techniques which are employed by the \nDEA, the FBI, and local law enforcement to deal with violent \nand dangerous criminals. These investigative strategies are \nthen borrowed and used by IRS CID in routine criminal tax \ninvestigations of taxpayers who are neither violent nor \ndangerous.\n    Many of us believe this is very bad tax enforcement policy. \nToday we see too many ``cowboy agents,'' as they are called, \nwho are undisciplined, who are inadequately controlled, and who \nthink that the end of putting away the bad guys justifies the \nmeans, that is, these intrusive, intimidating, and oppressive \ninvestigations."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Mr. Davis, you will recall that it was \nthe IRS that finally nailed Al Capone.\n    Mr. Davis. Absolutely. I do, indeed, Senator Moynihan. That \nhas been mentioned repeatedly throughout the recent history of \nthe Internal Revenue Service in justification of the use of \nthese kinds of techniques. That is an important observation, \nand there is value in that function. The problem is, we all are \ncomfortable with the concept of using those kinds of techniques \nin dealing with violent criminals, and Mr. Capone and his ilk \nwere in that class.\n    What troubles us, is are we equally wise to use those same \nstrategies when we are dealing with a citizen who runs a little \ngrocery store by the side of the road?"
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    A fair and explicit question.\n    Mr. Davis. Yes, sir. Indeed, it is. Thank you for raising \nthat question.\n    The example I would like to bring to you, if I may, from my \nown experience is as follows. In June of 1994, approximately 10 \nIRS special agents appeared at a private residence at 7:30 in \nthe morning. They knocked on the door, which roused the \nresident of the home from her bath. This resident, Sally, \nanswered the door in her bathrobe. There were 10 IRS special \nagents in her yard and on her porch, one of whom presented a \nwarrant to search her home.\n    She was told that she could either leave her home or stay, \nbut if she left she would not be permitted to return until the \nsearch had been concluded. She chose to stay and was confined \nto one bedroom. The remaining agents searched her home for \nabout 8 hours and then they left. The only property which was \nseized and taken by them as evidence was 86 old family \nphotographs.\n    Have you a question, Senator Moynihan, or are you just \nreacting to what I am describing?"
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    I am listening.\n    Mr. Davis. Thank you.\n    Those 86 family photographs, many were taken at Christmas \ntime and showed the family around the Christmas tree. Later, \nSally discovered the real reason for that invasive search. It \nwas not to seize contraband, or weapons, or drugs, or evidence \nof any crime.\n    Instead, the agents had brought with them a furniture \nappraiser who went from room to room, valuing the beds, the \nsofas, the chairs, the tables, and other personal effects which \nhad been left in the house by her grandmother, who had passed \naway a few years earlier.\n    The IRS believed that Sally's father, the executor, had \nunder-valued the furniture on her grandmother's estate tax \nreturn. Sally was not a suspect or in any way involved in the \nestate tax matters, and her father did not live in the home \nwith her. The criminal investigation of Sally's father which \nwas then pending was later abandoned by the Internal Revenue \nService.\n    The extravagant use of agent time in preparing for and \nexecuting this raid on the home of an admittedly innocent party \nwas utterly needless. A simple telephone call to Sally would \nhave resulted in consent or permission for the appraiser to \nenter the house and inspect the furniture.\n    It is obvious in this context that intimidating and \nintrusive searches and seizes are simply not necessary to \ndevelop a valuation case involving household furniture. In my \nview, that search and seizure operation never should have been \nauthorized or executed. Several years later, fairly recently, I \ndemanded the return of the 86 family photographs and we finally \ngot them back.\n    I believe, and I think others may join me in this belief, \nthat kicking down doors, wearing body armor, and carrying \nautomatic weapons and bursting into people's homes with large \nraiding parties are techniques which should be used, if used at \nall, in investigations of dangerous and violent criminals.\n    The IRS CID should do what it was created to do, in my \nview, and that is to enforce the Internal Revenue laws and \nlargely leave violent and dangerous criminal suppression to the \nDEA, FBI, and local law enforcement authorities.\n    There should be exceptions to the rule in the case of \nviolent and dangerous criminals who threaten the public safety \nlike Al Capone, but those exceptions should be limited and the \nstrategies used in those cases should not be imported into the \nother class of cases which are their chief work.\n    I would also like to speak briefly on the subject of \nundercover operations. Some of us also believe that the deceit \nand the misrepresentation inherent in undercover investigations \nand sting operations have no proper place in routine criminal \ntax investigations.\n    Successful criminal tax prosecutions have long been made \nwithout the aid of these undercover techniques. Indeed, they \nare used in fewer than 3 percent of the total cases, according \nto IRS view, which leaves it pretty clear that one can make 97 \npercent of these cases--and I suspect a much greater \npercentage--without the use of these techniques.\n    I believe the IRS does serious damage to its image, its \nrelationship with the public, when it lies to and deceives \ntaxpayers in routine criminal tax investigations.\n    I would close with this thought, if I may. There is, I \nbelieve, a pervasive national frustration with our current \nFederal income tax system which is far too complex and far too \nunintelligible to be fairly and uniformly administered by the \nIRS, or, indeed, be complied with by the great majority of our \ntaxpayers.\n    I would, therefore, respectfully urge--and I heard this \nfrom other voices today--that the time is here for some kind of \nsubstantial simplification of the Internal Revenue laws which \nthe Internal Revenue Service must struggle to administer and \nthe taxpayers must equally struggle to comply with.\n    Thank you very much.\n    The Chairman. Well, thank you, Mr. Davis. As you have \nheard, we feel very strongly about the need of reform and \nsimplification.\n    Just let me say, as one citizen, I am outraged that any of \nour citizens would have to undergo and endure the kind of \nanguish that is caused by such intrusive practices. It is a \nserious matter that we are looking at very carefully.\n    Mr. Epstein?"

"","","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Mr. Epstein. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    My name is Earl Epstein and I am a practicing lawyer, a \nmember of a small firm in Philadelphia, and I appreciate the \nopportunity to testify here today.\n    For the past 35 years, after completing a clerkship at the \nU.S. Tax Court, I have been practicing tax law in Philadelphia. \nDuring that time, I have represented many taxpayers before the \nInternal Revenue Service.\n    It may sound like I am repeating what a lot of other people \nhave said here today, but it is the truth that most of the \npeople that I have worked with, from the Commissioner and the \nChief Counsel at the top, all the way down the line, have been \nterrific people, hardworking, honest people, and they do their \nbest and it is a difficult system. I guess I should say, some \nof my best friends work for the Internal Revenue Service.\n    But when you get down to the Collection Division, you have \na whole different situation because it is clear to me that \nharassment and overreaching by the Collection Division is not \nisolated, but is, indeed, a practice.\n    It is my experience that collection agents treat taxpayers \nas though they were deadbeats, people intent on cheating the \ngovernment. For some reason which I have never understood, they \nalso treat the taxpayers' representatives as though they were \njust accomplices in that effort.\n    Of course, that perception is an unfair one. For the most \npart, I found that people who cannot pay their taxes when they \nare due are often caught in circumstances which are not of \ntheir own making.\n    Sometimes they are innocent women caught in a situation \ncreated by their husbands. Some have been audited and found to \nhave made an honest mistake on their tax return, or maybe the \nTax Court has disagreed with a position.\n    Whatever the reason, they find that they do not have the \ncash with which to pay and, in most cases, it is the interest \nand penalties which are added on to the tax which cause their \ndownfall. Only rarely have I found taxpayers who have the money \nand just do not want to pay.\n    I would like to give you just a few quick examples of some \nof the cases in which I have been involved with over the years. \nJust recently, I came to represent a taxpayer who had directed \nhis previous attorney to make a $30,000 payment to a collection \nagent on the promise by the agent that the payment would be \ncredited to his personal liability and not to a corporate \nliability for which he was not responsible.\n    When the attorney made the payment, in fact, the $30,000 \nwas credited to the corporate liability. When I got into the \ncase and I challenged the agent, he just laughed at me and he \nsaid, well, did your client get that promise in writing? And \nthat was the end of the story. My client had to pay the $30,000 \nagain, which he borrowed from his father.\n    A few months ago, the Collection Division placed a lien \nagainst the joint account of a husband and wife in Tennessee \nwhen the liability for the tax was only the husband.\n    I brought the agent's attention to a Tennessee Supreme \nCourt case which was controlling which made the lien invalid \nagainst the joint bank account, but the result was that the \nagent would not listen and the funds which the wife had \nborrowed from her father to pay for food for her children was \ntaken by the Internal Revenue Service. The amount that was \ninvolved just did not justify the litigation that would be \nrequired to recover the funds.\n    A number of years ago, a woman came to me with a story. She \nsaid her beauty shop had been sold by a collection agent at \nauction, even though she had displayed a canceled check for \n$175 showing that the tax had been paid. The agent would not \nlook at the check, refused to listen, and went ahead and \nconducted a public auction in front of her friends and her \nfamily. She came to me afterwards and I started to check into \nit.\n    What I discovered was that the Internal Revenue Service had \nmade a computer error. They had debited the tax twice and only \ngiven her one credit for the payment, so that when they added \nup the totals before this auction it actually showed the tax \nwas due, and it was not.\n    I went to look at what I could do about it. Well, the \nFederal Tort Claims Act prevents you from bringing an action \nagainst the government for this kind of a situation. The most I \nwas able to do for her was to get a private bill introduced \ninto the House which would have allowed her to sue for \ncompensation, but that, of course, died in committee. It was \njust a little thing, and that was the end of her. The only \nthing she had to show for it was that she could show her \nfriends the printed copy of the House bill.\n    During my representation of a taxpayer who had been \nharassed by the IRS over a period of years, I attempted to \nsettle his case with the Collection Division. We filed the Form \n433, which is a list of his assets and liabilities, and that is \nsigned under the penalties of perjury.\n    The next thing we knew is that an agent, one that I had \ndealt with before, had fought with before, and had problems \nwith before, got into the case and he started a criminal \ninvestigation. This went on for some time, with my taxpayer \nspending a lot of money on representation.\n    Finally, we caused a hearing to be held in the U.S. \nDistrict Court to quash a subpoena that was issued by the IRS. \nAt that point when the District Court judge heard the story, \nshe turned to the agent and said, what is this all about; what \nare you looking for? Sheepishly, he admitted that there were \ntwo stocks that were in the name of the taxpayer which were not \nlisted on the form.\n    The taxpayer leaned over to me and whispered, they are in \ncustodian names for my children, they are not mine. I informed \nthe court and the court said, fine. Bring the certificates in \nand show them to me tomorrow morning. Then she turned to the \nagent and she said, I do not want you bothering these people. \nStay away from them until we conclude this matter.\n    At 7:00 the next morning I got a phone call from my client. \nThat agent had been pounding on his mother's door, an 85-year-\nold woman, demanding to be let into the garage to go through \npapers in the garage.\n    Of course, I reported this to the court and of course the \ncourt chastised the agent. But I have to tell you that I had to \ndeal with him again and again, and as far as I could tell \nnothing ever happened to him.\n    A few years ago, a collection agent came to my office and \nasked to see me on a personal matter. My secretary came in and \nsaid, it is personal. I thought maybe he had a problem that he \nwanted to consult me with. When he got into my office, he \ndemanded to see files of my client.\n    I said, first of all, I have an attorney-client privilege \nand you know I am not going to show you the files. Second of \nall, why did you lie? Why did you tell my secretary it was a \npersonal matter when you knew it was not? He looked at me and \nhe kind of shrugged his shoulders. He said, well, sometimes we \nneed to lie.\n    I asked him to leave. He would not leave. I insisted that \nhe leave. He did not leave. I finally--and this is the truth--\ngot up, I took him by the neck, and I marched him physically \nout of my office into the hallway to the elevators.\n    I was so incensed that I wrote a letter to the Commissioner \nof Internal Revenue, whom I believe at that time was Roscoe \nEdgar. Two days later, I got a phone call from the \nCommissioner's office. They were horrified at the story. They \npromised to investigate.\n    A couple of weeks later I got another call from the \nCommissioner's office saying they had investigated, they \napologized, and that the agent would be disciplined, but please \ndo not ask what the discipline is, and I left it at that.\n    What that tells me is, when the Commissioner finds out \nabout these things, when the hierarchy knows about these \nsituations, they will do something and they will take action. I \nthink the problem is, most of the time it does not get that \nhigh and the people down at the lower end in the Collection \nDivision do not care and they protect each other. I think what \nyou have is an institutional philosophy or personality where \nfear and intimidation is approved.\n    My only suggestion to you, sir, and I know you have adopted \nsome of the provisions of the Federal Debt Collection Practices \nAct, which I think is wonderful, but I think the key to this \nthing is that a right of an individual who is harmed to bring \nan action, not only against the institution, but against the \nindividual.\n    Senator Gramm talked about justice. As far as I am \nconcerned, the only justice that we will ever get is if the \nindividual and the institution is concerned about personal \nliability as a result of improper actions and violations.\n    Thank you, sir. I would like to submit more detailed \nwritten comments, if you would.\n    The Chairman. Thank you. Your full statement will be \nincluded as if read. You are correct, we have incorporated the \nstandards established by the Fair Debt Collection Practices \nAct, but will look further at your suggestion."

break,break,break,break
"","","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Mr. MacNaughton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    My name is Phil MacNaughton. I am a lawyer with offices in \nHouston and my practice does include representing taxpayers \nbefore Internal Revenue in tax controversies and some \ncollection matters.\n    The Internal Revenue Service has claimed that its officers \nare trying to be fair with taxpayers and that the occasional \nhorror stories represent aberrant situations. I would like to \ntell you about one IRS revenue officer whose abusive actions \nmay have literally hounded a Houston taxpayer to death.\n    In 1995, a CPA referred to me a 61-year-old swimming pool \ndesigner who was being pursued then by tax collectors in \nconnection with possible assessment of 941 and payroll taxes. \nAlthough ill with heart disease and cancer, the man was still \nworking each day and he was supporting himself and his family.\n    The first thing I did was contact the revenue officer, \ndetermined what information he wanted. I provided it. I also \nsent to him a letter that detailed the taxpayer's fragile \nmedical condition and I asked him to route all communication \nthrough me.\n    In mid-1995, my office filed on behalf of that client a \nwritten offer to compromise the taxes. The Internal Revenue \nManual has written procedures governing the offer and \ncompromise process. Those procedures include statements that \nthe collection activity shall cease during the pendency of a \ngood-faith offer and compromise. They get more detailed than \nthat, but that is the general rule.\n    Despite that, though, the revenue officer continued his \ncollection activities in this case despite continued objections \nby me. I advised the revenue officer that these collection \nefforts were in violation of written IRS procedures and that \nthey also, more importantly, were a threat to the taxpayer's \nlife because he did suffer from heart disease, he had \nexperienced, I think, three heart attacks by then, and he had \nreported to me that the IRS collection actions were terrifying \nto him.\n    In response, that revenue officer typed up a summons, \npersonally, he told me, ordering the taxpayer to appear before \nhim for face-to-face interrogation, and then personally drove \nthat summons to the taxpayer's house and served it on his son \nwhen he was not there.\n    My client called me, clearly shaken. I called the revenue \nofficer and asked him to provide to me any questions to which \nhe wanted answers, but he told me that what he really wanted, \nand intended to get, was a personal confrontation between \nhimself and my client.\n    I asked him why and he was simply silent. This was a phone \nconversation and, for perhaps 15 seconds, there was dead \nsilence. I reminded the revenue officer that my client was ill \nwith heart disease and cancer and should not be subjected to \nthe stress of face-to-face interrogation. He responded then \nwith derisive laughter.\n    I then contacted his supervisor, explained the situation, \nand asked for her to stop the harassment. But she refused, \nsaying only that she, in her words, ``stood behind her revenue \nofficers.'' I asked her just to reassign the case to a \ndifferent RO, but she declined to do that. I then contacted the \nChief of Collections and asked him to stop the harassment, but \nhe also declined.\n    Next, I contacted the Problem Resolution Office in Houston \nand requested what is called a taxpayer assistance order to \nstop the harassment. In support of that request, with it, I \nfaxed a copy of a letter I had obtained from the taxpayer's \nphysician.\n    The letter stated that the taxpayer was, in the physician's \nwords, ``severely impaired and unable to withstand stressful \nsituations because of his severe heart failure and cancer.''\n    The Problem Resolution Office declined to issue the TAO \nbecause there was ``no significant hardship,'' although \nprivately the personnel there acknowledged that they knew this \nofficer was someone they felt was mean.\n    The IRS continued its collection actions. In late October \nof 1995, my client received a notice of intent to levy. Ashen-\nfaced and visibly distressed, he hand-delivered the letter to \nme that same day. Two days later, he died from heart failure. \nHe was then 61 years old, and is survived by his wife and four \nchildren.\n    I provided that information to the Treasury Department and \nasked them to investigate. The Regional Inspector General for \nInvestigations, Southern Region, concluded that, ``These issues \nare best addressed by the agency involved,'' and sent the file \nback to IRS.\n    IRS then sent me a letter which claimed to report the \nresults of the investigation. IRS's investigation consisted \nentirely of accepting everything said by the revenue officer \nwhose behavior was in question as gospel. Not surprisingly, the \nIRS came to the conclusion that the revenue officer's actions \nwere, in their words, ``taken in accordance with agency \nprocedures.''\n    I do not think anyone can be certain that that RO's actions \nwere the proximate cause of that taxpayer's death. But what is \nclear to me is that that officer demonstrated a callous \ndisregard for a taxpayer's life, that his behavior was condoned \nspecifically by his supervisor, it was permitted by the Chief \nof Collections, it was not stopped by the Problem Resolution \nOffice, and it was, in my opinion, not adequately handled by \nTreasury or by the IRS when it was brought to their attention.\n    IRS abuse is not a series of isolated events. It is my \nexperience that IRS culture increasingly permits, and even \nencourages, taxpayer abuse. Many IRS collection personnel \nregularly ignore written IRS rules and procedures, jumping from \none excuse to another while they continue to harass taxpayers.\n    I know of one IRS employee whose in-service instructor \nasked of the class how the IRS enforces tax compliance. After a \nmoment of silence in the classroom, he wrote the word fear in \nletters that reached from the top of the blackboard to the \nbottom, and then left the room.\n    I hope these hearings and the reform bills will help \ncorrect IRS's drift into becoming our National bully. But, if I \nmay, while these reforms are welcomed they are only a temporary \nfix, in my opinion. The long-term solution will require \nreplacing the income tax system as a method of financing our \ngovernment.\n    Even if Congress were able to stop all the abuse and to \nspend all of the money necessary to replace IRS's Model T \ncomputer system, we would still have a system that requires the \ndeep intrusion of the Federal Government into the daily life of \nmany, if not most, Americans, one that burdens us every year \nwith the need to spend time and money filling out exquisitely \ncomplex forms.\n    I have heard about flat taxes and I do not see how they \nsolve this problem. I do some audit work too, and I have never \nhad an audit where application of the correct brackets was even \nan issue, much less a problem.\n    The problem is, income is just a complicated concept. If \nyou tax income, you have to define it. All simplistic \ndefinitions will fail and you will have to come up with the \ncomplicated ones you have now, or something like it. Any tax on \nincome, flat or graduated, is still going to require a \ncomplicated Tax Code and, therefore, a huge Federal \nbureaucracy.\n    Still, the issue of the moment is taxpayer abuse at the \nhands of the IRS, and I thank you for refusing to accept it. \nThank you.\n    The Chairman. Well, I thank you for being here. You are \nright, your client's experience is not unique. This is a matter \nof great concern to me, as well as the question of simplicity \nof the tax system."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    But Mr. Chairman, we are about to hear \nMr. MacNaughton's solution and his time was up. If you have an \nanswer, you would not mind putting it in writing, would you?\n    The Chairman. We would be very happy to receive that.\n    Mr. MacNaughton. Sir, if I may, my dad, who is 91 now, was \na practicing accountant for some 65 years, and had a solution. \nHe said, all we need is a simple law that would require all of \nthe members of Congress and the President to prepare their own \ntax return without professional assistance. [Laughter.]\n    The Chairman. That may well be the answer. Well, thank you, \nMr. MacNaughton. The hour is growing late and we do have a \npolicy luncheon, so I do want to proceed.\n    Mr. Mayo?"

"","","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Mr. Mayo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    My name is Cody Mayo and I live and work in Shreveport, \nLouisiana. I graduated from Louisiana Tech University in 1976 \nwith a degree in accounting. I went to law school at Louisiana \nState University Law Center, and graduated in 1979.\n    My first job was with the Caddo Parish District Attorney's \nOffice as Assistant District Attorney, a position that I still \nhold this day, prosecuting only special white collar crime \nassignments.\n    In early 1981, I took and passed the CPA exam and I \ncontinue to hold a license as a certified public accountant. I \nreturned to school in 1981 and earned a Master of Laws and \nTaxation, graduating in 1982 from Southern Methodist University \nSchool of Law.\n    Since that time, I have had an active tax practice, as well \nas holding a part-time position as Assistant District Attorney. \nI am board certified in taxation, I am board certified in \nestate planning and administration. I know almost everyone in \nthe Shreveport office of the Internal Revenue Service on a \nfirst-name basis.\n    I have represented taxpayer in disputes with the IRS most \nof my career. These taxpayers come to me in their times of \ncrisis for help in dealing with a Tax Code that to them is \nconfusing and insurmountably complex, while at the same time \ndealing with an agency that too often is overbearing and, in \nsome cases, outright mean.\n    I enjoy my work because it pits David against Goliath, the \nlittle guy in need of help against the most powerful of \nagencies. This, to me, is the ultimate calling of a lawyer, to \nhelp those people who would otherwise be helpless.\n    It is because of this that I come before you now, because \nwithout lawyers who are willing to aid taxpayers against the \nGoliath of the IRS the individual taxpayer, the small \nbusinessman, the everyday go-to-work-pay-your-taxes American \nwill be defenseless when caught in IRS's cross-hairs.\n    Through many years of experience I have seen the mental \nanguish and depression suffered by taxpayers who are under \naudit or investigation. For many, it is the worst experience of \ntheir lives.\n    Several of my clients have divorced because of the pressure \nof IRS audits or investigations. One of my clients, a very \nsuccessful businessman, actually had a nervous breakdown \nbecause of the audit and was taken from his house in a \nstraightjacket by deputy sheriffs.\n    One of my clients put a .357 magnum to his head and blew \nhis brains out just 4 days before his Tax Court case came to \ntrial because he could not take the stress any longer.\n    These experiences have shown me why it is important to have \ncompetent and zealous representation for the American taxpayer. \nOften I, as a tax attorney, am the only thing that stands \nbetween the defenseless taxpayer and the IRS juggernaut.\n    As a lawyer who represents taxpayers I have had the \nopportunity and the pleasure, and in some cases unfortunately \nthe misfortune, of working closely with agents and employees of \nthe IRS. Over the years I have met and worked with and, in many \ncases, become friends with many fine employees of the IRS.\n    While I am here to talk about the abuses that I have \nsuffered and observed from certain members of the service, it \nwould also be a disservice to paint with a broad brush and \nimply that all agents and employees of the IRS are bad people. \nMost of them are not. They are loyal public servants trying to \ndo a most difficult and thankless job.\n    While I have had my disagreements with many over taxpayer \nissues, I can say over the years I have come to respect many \npersons within the agency who serve it loyally. Many of these \nsame people have become my friends and, in recent years, my \nclients.\n    Too many of these loyal public servants have themselves \nbecome victim of the IRS culture and have been singled out for \nabuse and discrimination by an agency that, in all fairness, is \nout of control.\n    There is a clear and present danger not only to taxpayers, \nbut the agency's own employees have been and are being \nsubjected to arbitrary and outrageous treatment at the hands of \nthe IRS.\n    My most immediate concern, however, is the agency now has \ngone beyond merely abusing taxpayers and many of its own loyal \nagents and employees. I, as a tax lawyer, am concerned that it \nappears that the agency has in some instances directly targeted \nlawyers who represent taxpayer in an effort to intimidate, \nharass, and I believe with an ultimate goal of making lawyers \nthink twice about zealously representing taxpayers.\n    I know this because I was, and still may be, a target of \nsuch agency attack. I have also witnesses firsthand the \ntargeting and criminal investigation of another tax attorney \nover a matter that can best be characterized as a witch hunt.\n    When the government became aware of the existence of \nevidence of this lawyer's unquestioned innocence, the \ngovernment chose to abandon the investigation or risk exposure \nof its sinister motives.\n    I have heard that many prominent tax attorneys are \nunwilling to appear before this committee because they are \nafraid of the retaliation of the kind I have suffered. Frankly, \nI am concerned that my appearance here could further enlarge \nthe target on my back.\n    In 1992 and 1993, I was representing a small business \ncorporation and the two owners of the business in an audit \nproceeding of the corporation with the IRS. During the course \nof the audit, the local group manager for exam at the IRS \nbecame enraged when I refused to allow my clients to be \ninterviewed by the IRS, asserting their constitutional \nprivilege against self-incrimination.\n    The agent thereupon directly threatened to subject me to \nthe full wrath of the agency, stating, ``Maybe we just ought to \naudit you.'' Understandably, I was shocked at this direct \nthreat of retaliation. Soon thereafter, I learned that this was \nnot an idle threat.\n    I was soon subject not only to an audit, but to an intense \ncriminal investigation as well. My clients and business \nassociates were bombarded with IRS summonses as part of the \ncriminal investigation. My business and financial dealings were \nput under intense scrutiny.\n    My confidential tax information was illegally disclosed, \nwith the primary instigator of this vendetta openly bragging \namong other IRS employees of what he was doing and why, all \nbecause I stood up for my clients.\n    After several grueling months of this torture, the IRS \nfinally dropped the criminal investigation and issued a no \nchange letter on my audit because, despite their best efforts, \nthere was nothing to hang me.\n    My paranoia had saved me. Because I had always feared that \nsome day I might be a target, I have always overpaid my taxes. \nAs the IRS's own records show, my overpayment was very \nsubstantial and the IRS knew it from the beginning.\n    As stated earlier, having the IRS investigate your affairs \nand scrutinize you is, at best, uncomfortable, but when there \nis someone behind the investigation that is trying to carry out \na personal vendetta, it can be downright scary. I frequently \nhad to ask myself if it is worth it. I have my family to think \nabout and I wonder, should I find something else to do, some \nother way to make a living?\n    I can tell you from first-hand experience, when two IRS \nagents, one of them armed with a gun, corner you as you leave \nthe District Attorney's Office where you work after following \nyou there, produce their badges, and tell you that you are \nunder criminal investigation for having failed to file your tax \nreturns when the returns have, in fact, already been filed, it \nis very stressful and it makes you wonder what has happened to \nour country.\n    Unfortunately, the abuse did not stop even after the \ntermination of the criminal investigation and after the audit \nshowed my return was 100 percent correct. I was due a \nsubstantial refund. A campaign of harassment continued for \nyears.\n    In June of 1996, I finally heard from other agency \nemployees that the years of abuse I have suffered was a result \nof a vendetta by the group manager who was bent on punishing me \nfor daring to stand up for my clients.\n    I have now initiated a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court \nfor the Western District of Louisiana seeking redress for what \ncan only be described as outrageous conduct on the part of the \nIRS.\n    The group manager violated existing Federal law prohibiting \nwillful oppression of a taxpayer. This is a felony. The Justice \nDepartment has the responsibility to prosecute agency employees \nwho wailfully oppress taxpayers or disclose taxpayer \ninformation, then must also defend the action of the same IRS \nemployees in civil suits brought by oppressed taxpayers. \nDespite the lawyer jokes you have heard, this does require \ntalking out of both sides of your mouth. What is wrong with \nthis picture?\n    The IRS has responded to my lawsuit, claiming, in essence, \nthat even if these facts are true, it contends I have no \nrecourse against the IRS, or even the responsible employee. The \nIRS contends that it and its employees are immune from this \ntype of suit.\n    Legislation is needed to make it absolutely clear to the \nIRS that this type of conduct is unacceptable and that it will \nbe held responsible. I think Mr. Epstein referred to a private \ncause of action. Just about everyone at this panel could tell \nyou that that is definitely needed.\n    The agency cannot be trusted to police itself. I only filed \nsuit after making a complaint to the Internal Security Division \nand nothing was done. I express my concern to the members of \nthis committee. This committee has become aware in recent \nmonths of shocking instances of abuse of taxpayers, and more \nrecently abuse of IRS employees, by an agency that is clearly \nout of control.\n    The IRS is now targeting even the attorneys who dare to \nrepresent the everyday taxpayer in what I believe is an attempt \nto intimidate and harass those attorneys who dare to stand up \nfor American taxpayers.\n    For good reason, this is an area which most attorneys fear \nto tread. In light of the outrageous abuses of taxpayers \nbrought before this committee in recent months, the need for \ncompetent and zealous representation of the American taxpayer \nis of obvious necessity.\n    The attempt of the IRS to deprive citizens of their right \nto competent and zealous representation through harassment, \nintimidation, and abuse of the attorneys representing these \ntaxpayer must be stopped. Taxpayer representatives need \nprotection from the IRS.\n    Thank you.\n    The Chairman. Thank you. Just let me say that right of \ncounsel is an important right. I can tell you it is very \ndisturbing to sit here and listen to your testimony. That is \nthe reason for these hearings, to try to do something about it, \nand I appreciate each and every one of you being here.\n    I have a series of questions that I would like to ask the \npanel. First, all of you have described in your statements \ntoday some kind of an experience with an over-zealous or \nabusive IRS employee.\n    How difficult was it for you to receive a response from the \nIRS when you reported this abuse? Was action ever taken to \nreprimand or remove the employee? I think, Mr. Mayo, you have \nalready answered that question, but if you care to elaborate.\n    Mr. Mayo. It does not take very long to get a response. \nResponse comes fairly quickly, and the answer is, we are not \ngoing to do anything about it.\n    The Chairman. Mr. MacNaughton?\n    Mr. MacNaughton. That was exactly my experience. I got \nresponses very quickly and the responses were either, I am not \ngoing to do something about it, or it is somebody else's job \nand that is why I am not going to do anything about it.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Epstein?\n    Mr. Epstein. I had that one contrary experience where I \nwrote directly to the Commissioner, and I felt that he was \nzealous in doing something. Of course, I do not know exactly \nwhat it is that he did, but he certainly responded and did \nindicate that he felt that the actions of the agent were wrong. \nBut within the Collection Division itself, I would agree with \nmy colleagues, that you get no response and no assistance.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Davis?\n    Mr. Davis. And the fundamental experience I have had is \nthat the accounts of the taxpayer's representative and the \ntaxpayer are discounted, not given credit, and the assessment \nof what went on and the report by the agent is always accepted. \nThere is no objective attempt to find fact, and the complaint \nis almost uniformly rejected. That has been my experience.\n    The Chairman. Let me ask you this, Mr. Davis, and I will \nask each of you. In your experience representing taxpayers, \nhave you ever known an IRS employee to open a fraudulent \ncriminal case in retaliation against a taxpayer or as part of a \npersonal vendetta? If so, what happened to the IRS employee, \nwhat about the targeted taxpayer?\n    Mr. Davis. Of course, this is a subjective assessment of \nwhy someone did something. My experience tells me that, yes, \ncriminal tax investigations and civil examinations of returns \nhave been initiated by individual revenue agents and revenue \nofficers, in part, in retaliation for positions taken by the \ntaxpayers or taxpayers' representatives. I believe that to be \ntrue. Again, that is my personal assessment. I cannot vouch for \nwhat is in the mind of the person making the referral.\n    The Chairman. We appreciate and understand that."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Mr. Chairman, could I just remark at this \npoint, in response to Mr. Davis' comments and the others', that \nCommissioner Rossotti has appointed Judge William Webster to \nconduct an independent investigation of the Criminal \nInvestigation Division.\n    Judge Webster was a Federal Judge, he was Director of the \nFBI, and the Central Intelligence Agency. I think we should see \nthat he has this testimony directly.\n    I am particularly impressed by the thought of the carry \nover of the modes of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and \nFirearms into body armor and automatic weapons. That is not \nappropriate to a tax collection agency.\n    The Chairman. I have to say, Senator Moynihan, that to me \nit is very disturbing, very much a concern, that these \nintrusive tactics which were not the practice 10, 15 years ago, \nare becoming so commonplace."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    This has the quality of fashion about it.\n    The Chairman. As I said in my opening statement, I \ncongratulate and applaud what the new Commissioner has done in \ncreating this independent study, because I think is a matter of \nthe highest importance in reform of the culture of IRS.\n    Mr. Epstein, do you want to make further comment on my \nquestion?\n    Mr. Epstein. No, I think I agree with what Mr. Davis said. \nAbsolutely.\n    The Chairman. Mr. MacNaughton?\n    Mr. MacNaughton. I have not had that experience.\n    The Chairman. You have not.\n    Mr. Mayo?\n    Mr. Mayo. I am familiar with one. I am familiar with two, \nmy own and another one that I saw less than a month ago.\n    The Chairman. Having heard your testimony, Mr. Mayo, I \nwould like to ask the rest of our practitioners if they have \never personally experienced retaliation from the IRS because of \ntheir representation of a taxpayer.\n    Mr. Davis?\n    Mr. Davis. Well, yes, although I would say much of the \nretaliation I have experienced I will put in the category of \nlawful but reprehensible conduct. That is, there will be a \nlevel of rudeness, abruptness, and unfairness in the exchanges, \nwhich I regard as lawful.\n    They do not have to love me, and they do not love me, when \nI take a role of vigorous advocacy. That occurs. In terms of \nany direct referral of my returns or any direct retaliation, I \nfortunately have not had that experience.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Epstein?\n    Mr. Epstein. I have had no problem with that, and I \ncertainly hope it does not start tomorrow morning. [Laughter.]\n    The Chairman. Mr. MacNaughton?\n    Mr. MacNaughton. I have had the experience Mr. Davis \ndescribes, and I also hope that it does not start tomorrow.\n    The Chairman. The last question I will ask, and I may \nsubmit some of these in writing, but do you have any \nsuggestions of ways to change the current culture of the IRS to \nprevent the inappropriate use of armed raids and other \nunnecessary law enforcement techniques? Mr. Davis?\n    Mr. Davis. Well, I believe, Mr. Chairman, I have suggested \none. That is, to a considerable extent it may be useful to \nredirect the resources of the Internal Revenue Service back \ninto what they refer to as tax gap cases. Those are cases which \nare directly intended to reduce this $100 billion deficiency or \nthis amount which goes unreported each year.\n    There are roughly 3,500, perhaps, IRS special agents in the \nUnited States, and 40 percent or more, as much as 50 percent, \nof those resources have been used in specialized investigations \nin areas that are currently of interest to the Congress, for \nexample, drugs and organized crime, Medicare fraud, bank and \nsavings and loan fraud, and they deflect their resources into \nthose areas where they get in touch with these intrusive \ntechniques and they become sort of commonplace.\n    If they would spend more of their resources trying to \ncollect that $100 billion gap which they have themselves \nidentified, that might be the proper calling for them and keep \nthem away from the temptation to borrow the hard-ball \ntechniques from Drug Enforcement and use them against mom and \npop and their grocery store on the street corner.\n    I think if they would use their resources in the way I \nthink Congress intended--I hope that I am right in that \ninterpretation--then I think there would be less temptation to \nget involved in this hard-ball strategy that is currently being \nused.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Davis.\n    Mr. Epstein?\n    Mr. Epstein. Yes, I have one thought. If some of the \nactions that we have heard took place in private industry, \nthere would be a right of action where you would be able to sue \nthe company, you would be able to sue the employee who harassed \nyou or caused you harm. The Federal Tort Claims Act, as I \nunderstand it, protects the individual and the government from \nactions, civil actions, for damages.\n    To me, that gives them a license that nobody else in the \neconomy has. If I do something to my employee or harass the \nemployee, either I get sued or my firm gets sued. But if \nsomeone from any government agency does the same thing, they \nare protected and the agency is protected.\n    So to me, the first thing is, I would give a right of \naction, private action, against the individual and the agency. \nThe second thing I think I would do, which I think is almost as \nimportant, is that I would require the Commissioner to report \nto the Congress personally each year about actions for \nharassment or violations and compensation paid by courts.\n    In other words, put the Commissioner in the position where \nhe must know about what happened and he must stand before you \nand report what happened. My reaction is that if the \nCommissioner had to do that, he would do everything in his \npower to stop it because he would not want the embarrassment of \nstanding in front of this committee.\n    The Chairman. How would you answer the assertion on the \npart of some that if you created such a cause of action, the \nIRS agent would not act, he would not place himself at any \nrisk, so your whole enforcement procedure would collapse.\n    Mr. Epstein. Well, to me that is a specious argument. If \nyou follow the rules, and the Internal Revenue Manual is very \nclear on what the rules are, you are safe, if you do not follow \nthe rules, you are at risk.\n    The Chairman. Let me ask Mr. Davis, do you have any comment \non the creation of a tort and the concern that that would \nhamstring efforts?\n    Mr. Davis. Yes, Mr. Chairman. I will confess, I am very \nconcerned about that. It is true that we in the private world \nare accountable in civil lawsuits, and even otherwise in \ncriminal proceedings, if our conduct crosses the lines. But I \nam more cautious about the idea of creating a private cause of \naction involving individual IRS employees.\n    I am not suggesting there should be no remedy. One may \nfashion a remedy that would cause the agency to respond, the \nInternal Revenue Service to respond, if it inflicts suffering \non taxpayers, but the individual action I view as a closer call \nand one about which I would be somewhat more cautious, I think.\n    The Chairman. Thank you.\n    Mr. MacNaughton?\n    Mr. MacNaughton. How to police the police has always been a \nproblem. I think it is also true that governments are \ninherently less responsive to lawsuits than are private \nindividuals because governments can spend somebody else's money \nto respond to them. It does make for a problem. I think a \nprivate remedy is appropriate under egregious situations.\n    I also think, though, that in my experience where this \nproblem will get addressed is when people that work for the IRS \nknow that misbehavior--and these are not mistakes, these are \nintentional abuse situations--is not going to be tolerated, and \nthey will know that when they have a Commissioner who makes \nthat clear and when they have a committee like this one that \nmakes that clear, if that is held over time then it will not be \na problem that goes away and has to be revisited every 5 or 6 \nyears because the Commissioner is there continuously.\n    I have seen this in other governmental agency situations. \nWhen you get leadership that, in fact, says abuse will not be \ntolerated, then people change and the culture then can change. \nWithout it, I think it is very hard to get there through \nlegislation and penalties.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Mayo?\n    Mr. Mayo. My solution would be two-fold. I do not see a \nproblem with a private cause of action. We have private causes \nof action against all the police departments in the country. \nWhen a policeman violates rules and beats up a citizen, he can \nbe sued. Now, what is the difference with an IRS agent that \nviolates the rules and beats up on a taxpayer? He should be \nsued, too.\n    But that is the negative reinforcement. There is a better \nsolution, in my mind. That is, I am familiar with all of the \nrevenue officers in my local district. I know that they are all \noverworked. Taxpayer harassment that we have talked about today \nis referred to in the business as Grade 9 technique.\n    The Chairman. As what?\n    Mr. Mayo. Grade 9 technique. Grade 9 is a lower level \nrevenue officer who is out there trying to do his job because \nhe is overworked and he does not have the experience needed to \nbring all the tools into play. Believe me, they have all the \ntools need.\n    So if there were more revenue officers and they were \ntrained, as Mr. MacNaughton says, they could increase revenue. \nA good revenue officer ought to be able to collect a couple of \nmillion dollars a year.\n    I happen to represent a man named W.E. Weldon who was \nRevenue Officer of the Year in 1993 or 1994, and I have seen \nhim deal with a taxpayer over and over again, that when we got \nup from the meeting to leave, the taxpayer would say thank you. \nThank you.\n    You are fixing to take my house, I have got to sell my car. \nI do not know what I am going to do. But thank you, Mr. Weldon, \nfor being so nice about it. He was good. You could talk around \nmy town, and all of the people who have dealt with him will \ntell you, he is a prince of a man.\n    You can do this job without being mean. If you had more \npeople with more resources, they could collect more money. \nFront-line officers, not management types.Front-line officers.\n    The Chairman. Maybe the solution is what the New Yorker \nrecently had. It had a cartoon with a revenue agent and a \ntaxpayer there, and on the side was a jar that said ``tips.'' \nMaybe we could seek that as a goal. [Laughter.]\n     Senator Moynihan."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Very briefly, Mr. Chairman. This has been \nwonderful testimony. I again say Judge Webster should have it \ndirectly.\n    I would address a question of culture and how you can \nchange it. I was in the navy 54 years ago. The U.S. Navy in \nthose days had just then given up flogging, but just, not \nquite. If you go aboard a Trident submarine today and you could \nbe in a Quaker meeting, such is the degree of cooperation and \nreciprocal agreement and understanding. Things do change and \nthey can change for the better, and for the worse, as when \npeople start breaking into houses with body armor.\n    I liked very much Mr. Davis' point about the gap. Senator \nKerrey raised that. There is $100 billion a year in taxes not \npaid. Senator Kerrey, there is $100 billion a year in taxes not \npaid, as you pointed out. More attention to that would be \nappropriate.\n    Well, first of all, just more revenue and less sorrow. I \nthink that is an organizational goal. You might just say, how \nmuch resources do we put into that goal as against other ones?\n    But Mr. Chairman, again, this is a wonderful panel. I have \nlearned a lot.\n    I think that father of yours knew something.\n    The Chairman. Thank you."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Thank you. I have to speak to a forum \nbeing conducted by our former colleague Senator Durenberger, so \nI will have to leave.\n    The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator Moynihan.\n    Senator Grassley?\n    Senator Grassley. Yes. Thank you very much for your \ntestimony. Before I ask a question, I would like to follow on \nand supplement something the Chairman said to the previous \npanel on a couple of occasions, that we realize the risk that \nthey take in being here to testify.\n    But I doubt very much if we feel the pain that they feel \nevery day they are having to be on the job with having the \nreputation of being a whistleblower, and probably the suffering \nthat they go through every day on the job.\n    I wish we all had a better understanding of that. If we \ndid, we probably would be more outraged than we are with all of \nthe testimony that you folks gave, and the testimony of the \nprevious panel, and probably the more outrageous testimony that \nwe are going to have. I should say more testimony of outrage we \nare going to have in the future meetings here.\n    I happen to chair the Committee on Aging here in the U.S. \nSenate, so I spend a lot of my time on the plight of older \nAmericans and trying to help them. Mr. MacNaughton, you were \nthe one that had the story about the ill client who was pursued \nby agents even after they knew that his illness was really bad, \nand that upsets me. Likewise, we had the story about an 80-\nyear-old grandmother out of bed at 5:00 a.m. That is also \ninexcusable. All the stories we hear are stories of preying on \nthe old, and these are particularly egregious situations.\n    To all witnesses, do you believe, from your experience, \nthat the IRS has any target on older people?\n    Mr. Davis. No, sir.\n    Mr. Epstein. No, sir.\n    Mr. MacNaughton. No, sir.\n    Mr. Mayo. No, sir.\n    Senator Grassley. Do you have any other cases or clients \nthat would illustrate what you are trying to tell us? In other \nwords, examples like you had given to us in your testimony. Or \ndoes that tend to be the only ones you know about?\n    Mr. Mayo. How much time do you have?\n    Mr. MacNaughton. I could talk all day, Senator.\n    Senator Grassley. Particularly as it relates to older \npeople.\n    Mr. Mayo. Generally speaking, in my practice what happens \nis, in the collection area, as is referred to earlier, a lot of \npeople get into collection problems because of things that they \nreally could not control.\n    The only time I have had a problem with older people was \nwhen it was an older tax debt. I had a situation where we could \nnot get an offer and compromise done last year for an older \ncouple. They had a home. They wanted to live in the home. We \nmade an offer and compromise that ultimately was more than the \nIRS collected on the sale of the home.\n    Finally, what I arranged was, they would not compromise the \nliability and the account has now been written off, or as they \nsay in the business, 53, considered uncollectible. They sold \nthe home at a tax sale rather than have the way we arranged the \ntransaction, which was for the taxpayer's brother to loan him \nsome money to compromise the case and take a second mortgage on \nthe home and release the tax lien.\n    The IRS would not have it, so in this situation we just \nsaid, sell it. I mean, fortunately, the taxpayer's brother and \nin-law were there to bid on the property so he did not have to \nmove out.\n    Senator Grassley. Mr. Mayo, would you elaborate on that \ncase you talked about in your testimony where you had a client \nwho committed suicide, you had another client who had a nervous \nbreakdown.\n    Mr. Mayo. The client that committed suicide was an oil \nfield worker. He had a sixth-, seventh-, or eighth-grade \neducation and he operated a cash business. He had gross income \nprobably in the $130,000 to $140,000 range, but only included \n$30,000 on his tax return.\n    Now, best we could figure was that that was his net and he \njust was unintelligent enough to know he really did not owe \nthat much money. But he did not have any records because he \noperated on a cash business.\n    So what happened was, he had $70,000 or $80,000 worth of \ncosts associated with this $100,000 of income he did not \ninclude, but he could not take a deduction for it because he \nhad no records. I had worked out a settlement between the IRS \nand the taxpayer, and it was reasonable considering the \ncircumstances, that they would allow a portion of that amount \nas a cost of goods sold. He was just in a position, he was \nfixing to have to spend his life's savings on paying taxes that \nhe did not owe, and he just could not take it.\n    It is my favorite Tax Court story, in a sad kind of way. \nThe Tax Court does not give continuances, so I had to call the \ncourt the morning after he killed himself and say, I need a \ncontinuance.\n    District Counsel said, well, you know, the Tax Court does \nnot give continuances. Well, we have got special circumstances. \nWell, what is it? Mr. So and So killed himself. Oh, you are \nkidding. No, I would not kid about that. Let us call the judge.\n    So we call the judge. We say, Mr. So and So has killed \nhimself. Oh, you are kidding. No, I would not kid about that. \nThen the judge asked the District Counsel, he said, you need to \ncheck out Mr. Mayo's story. I mean, for crying out loud, that \nwould not be anything I could just make up. A taxpayer cannot \nshow up alive later on.\n    But it was a major deal just to get a continuance of that \ncase for trial. I eventually was able to vindicate him. We \nturned up some records and I was eventually able to vindicate \nthe surviving spouse. I was just at the point of having her \nbeing evicted before we just saved that case, and she was \nelderly at the time.\n    Senator Grassley. Thank you.\n    The Chairman. Senator Kerrey."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    First of all, as to this issue of fear, the \nbest witness on that regard was Commissioner Richardson. She \nwas a former IRS Commissioner before Mr. Rossotti who appeared \nbefore the IRS Restructuring Commission and said when she \nreceived her first paycheck it came in an envelope with a \nreturn address of the IRS, and it even scared her to open the \nenvelope. So this issue of fear is a very important one for us \nto remember.\n    I would declare that I share Mr. MacNaughton's view that \nuntil we collect on some other transaction other than income, \ngiven that income is being more and more complex, as long as \nincome is complex it is going to be very difficult.\n    As long as you are going after income, it is going to be \nvery difficult for us to design a system that is not extremely \nintrusive. I think that is a fundamental problem that hopefully \nthis Congress can address.\n    I do think that we can change the law and improve the \noperation, but as long as we are going to go after income it is \ngoing to be and going to feel very, very intrusive and very, \nvery fearsome to the individual that has to document every \nsingle thing that they have done over whatever period of \ntransaction that the IRS is concerned about.\n    Let me ask you gentlemen, were you asked by this committee \nto evaluate the bill, the legislation that this committee \nreported out? I am struck in your testimony that none of you \nhave commented on the law that we are about to change.\n    Mr. Mayo. I have only received a copy of it. I have not yet \nhad the opportunity to study its provisions. What I have seen \nseems to move in the right direction, but I have not had \nadequate time."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Specifically, I would call to your \nattention and urge your comment on Title 3, which is all the \nchanges dealing with taxpayer rights. Senator Grassley, who has \nleft, was on the Restructuring Commission and took the lead in \nthis area, as well as Congressman Portman.\n    There are a number of things in there that you have talked \nabout here, including some right of action, some capacity to \nrecover damages, some capacity to recover damages especially if \nthe IRS has been negligent in the conduct of its efforts.\n    What we have said essentially is, as with all other areas \nof human endeavor, if there is not some kind of penalty that \nhas to be paid it tends to deter that small fraction of people.\n    By the way, one of the things the Restructuring Commission \nheard is, just as taxpayers are afraid of the IRS, sometimes \nthese revenue agents end up in positions of fear as well. There \nhave been death threats against employees. One of the things we \nhave to be very careful of is that we do not foment that kind \nof an environment.\n    But I would be very grateful, since the Majority Leader \nearlier announced that we are likely to be on the floor \ndebating this thing next week, if you would look, especially at \nTitle 1, which deals with a number of things that you have \naddressed.\n    As to the criminal investigations, unfortunately, the cause \nand effect of our actions was so unclear it is difficult to \nfigure out what is right and what is wrong. One thing that has \nhappened over the last 15 years, is we have had a huge increase \nin the amount of money laundering.\n    A lot of the investigations in the Criminal Investigation \nDivision occur as a result of a referral from some other law \nenforcement agency that is asking CID to get involved. They are \nasking to get involved as a result of us again saying we have \ngot to do something about drugs. So they are not doing it by \naccident. They are doing it, again, because of something that \nwe are doing.\n    So the only thing we have got in the bill right now creates \na unified, new Inspector General for Tax Administration inside \nof Treasury. What this committee and the Restructuring \nCommittee heard was there was a tendency to say, it is not our \nfault, it is the other guy's, and they point back and forth and \nthen nobody is accountable.\n    So if you can look at that, that is in Title 1 of the bill, \nand if you could give us your evaluation of whether or not you \nthink that is going to improve. Especially Title 1 and Title 2, \nbut anything else in this legislation. As I said, we are going \nto be debating it on the floor.\n    And, though I take Mr. McNaughton's point that it is going \nto be very difficult as long as we are taxing income, we have \ngot to do the best that we can under the circumstances. And we \nare not going to replace the income tax with a consumption tax \nthis year, but we are likely to change the law governing the \nIRS.\n    Something I would like you to commend on though that all of \nyou have kind of alluded to, and that is the resources that we \ngive the IRS. Again, I say for the record, IRS is not Sears and \nRoebuck. They do not generate the revenue by going out and \nselling product to customers, their revenue comes from us. We \ngive them their budget.\n    Mr. Rossotti, in his report that he has filed recently with \nCongress, lays down the challenge. IRS collects $1.5 trillion \nwith a budget of $7.2 billion. Now, for the record, on a \npercentage basis that is smaller than any other industrial \nnation. It is less than a half a percent of total revenue \ncollected.\n    They got a slight budget increase from last year with \nsubstantial more revenue, and I suspect you know what the \nphrase Schedule B is. We have increased the amount of work both \ntaxpayers and the IRS is going to have to do as a result of the \nBalanced Budget Agreement that we enacted last year.\n    I am still sending out press releases praising what I did \nlast year, while trying to avoid the responsibility for the \ncomplexity of the Code and the burden I am placing on the IRS \nto administer that Code.\n    So $1.5 trillion of collections, $7.2 billion of budget. \nThey process 215 million tax returns, 88 million refunds, \nassisted 110 million taxpayers, distributed a billion forms and \npublications, and on, and on, and on.\n    I would appreciate very much in the interim between today \nand whenever we take this up on the floor, and I will provide \nit to you, the year-to-year amount of money the IRS is \ncollecting, the changes in the Tax Code that have occurred \nduring that time period, and the amount of money that Congress \nhas authorized, and just give us your evaluation.\n    Are we part of the problem again? Are we shorting the \nagency? You have talked about the need to get high-quality, \nexperienced people. Mr. Mayo, you talked about an individual in \nyour own district who knows how to get the job done.\n    I mean, one of the problems in government is, we have got \nto hire, we have got to train, and we have got to retain. As \nyou know, once somebody gets pretty good at being a revenue \nagent, guess what? You guys hire them, or somebody else is \nhiring them. They become very attractive employees.\n    So part of our problem is trying to retain people and \ngetting the resources, it seems to me, as well as the authority \nto Mr. Rossotti so he can provide the kind of positive \nreinforcement, incentive pay, and all the other sorts of things \nthat this law does, it seems to me, is a very important issue.\n    Mr. Mayo. There is one thing, Senator. I can tell you that \nin my local office there are fewer Grade 12 agents there and \nfewer revenue agents there than there were 25 years ago.\n    Now, not only that, but they have lost five revenue agents \nin the last year, in the last 24 months, as a result of sexual \ndiscrimination and a program the Internal Revenue Service has \ncalled ERR 16, which was designed to promote minorities and \nwomen into upper level positions.\n    So the way they did it, was they evaluated managers on how \nwell they were promoting minorities and women. When you had an \nold Grade 12 guy that had been there and was good, you needed \nto move him out so you could hire somebody else. They have lost \ntheir pool of talent in my area. It just happened before our \nface."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    I had the very same experience. We had a \nfield hearing both in Nebraska and in Iowa, the Restructuring \nCommission, and we heard that from all of the people who are \nproviding services, that it is getting harder, and harder, and \nharder to get services because there are fewer and fewer people \navailable to provide those services, and we are asking them to \ndo more, essentially, with less.\n    So again, I would ask you, in addition to reviewing \nespecially the titles that are relevant to the things that you \nhave brought to our attention today, and I appreciate very much \nyour bringing them to our attention, and the Chairman bringing \nit before this committee, but if you could comment on the \nrelevant provisions specifically as to whether or not you think \nit is going to solve the problem or make it worse.\n    Second, I will also provide you the year-to-year budgets \nfor the IRS, as well as the amount of taxes they are collecting \nand some changes in the Tax Code, and just give me your \nresponse. Just give me your judgment. Are we providing a \nsufficient amount of public resources, given the amount of work \nwe are asking the IRS to do?\n    Mr. Davis. May I add one additional response? It will not \ntake long. One of the most useful words and important words I \nhave heard today, and I heard it several times, is the word \noversight. The Internal Revenue Service is an exquisitely \nsensitive political machine. If they perceive this body and the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee are watching their behavior and \nmonitoring what they are doing----"
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Sir, if I could interrupt you, one of the \nproblems--and I apologize for interrupting you.\n    Mr. Davis. No, sir."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    One of the problems that we have got, and \nthe Restructuring Commission heard it as well, is they do not \njust go to Finance and Ways and Means, they go to Finance, they \ngo to Ways and Means, they go to two appropriations committees, \nand two government oversight committees. They have six \ncommittees that the Commissioner has got to come up to.\n    Again, imagine if you had a little company out there and \nyou had 535 members of your board of directors, all elected. \nAsk a member just to sort of test them who just expressed their \noutrage, do they know the budget of the IRS? Ask them if they \nknow it. Ask them if they know how many returns are processed. \nAsk them if they know what the IRS does.\n    One of the problems that we have got, and you are quite \nright, this lack of oversight and accountability, we hope to \nsolve with a new public board. We are creating a board. That is \nin Title 1 of the legislation.\n    But I hope Congress is also able, in response to the public \nsaying you are part of the problem, you are not giving enough \noversight, that we will include language, as the House did, \nthat will require us to have some consolidation of oversight so \nthe IRS can come at least once or twice a year to a single \ncommittee and get agreement on what it is that we want them to \ndo. Right now you are apt to get six different sets of \ninstructions coming from six different committees.\n    Mr. Davis. One thing is clear to me since these hearings \nbegan, I think, in November. There has already been a change in \nthe attitude of some people within the Internal Revenue \nService.\n    They are sensitized to the fact that the Congress is \nlooking over their shoulder and they are dealing with us in a \nmore responsive and a more positive way. I think that is a \nbyproduct of this oversight. I do not want to overstate it, but \nI will simply say it is a wonderful thing that you are doing."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Thank you.\n    The Chairman. I would just give the personal observation \nthat, frankly, my concern is not that there is too much \noversight, there has been too little. This organization has \nbeen essentially isolated from oversight, either within any \nadministration now or past, that the Congress itself has not \nhelp appropriate oversight. I agree with you, Mr. Davis, as to \nthe need of doing a better job.\n    I want to echo what Senator Moynihan said. This has been an \nexcellent panel. We greatly appreciate your being here today. I \nknow it is at some risk and I regret that, but these hearings \nwould not be possible without public-spirited citizens like \nyourselves appearing today. Thank you very much.\n    The committee is in recess."

"","","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    The Chairman. The committee will please be in order.\n    Let me begin by welcoming everyone back to this second day \nof hearing to examine the policies and procedures of the \nInternal Revenue Service.\n    I believe that yesterday's proceedings clearly demonstrated \nhow important it is that we continue our oversight of this most \npowerful agency.\n    These efforts not only focus our attention on the \nrestructuring legislation that the Senate will take up next \nweek, but they also continue to define the critical issues that \nmust be addressed in our efforts to reform this agency.\n    Our work here is also having a very positive influence on \nthe administration's commitment to addressing problems within \nthe agency. Yesterday's appointment of William Webster to head \nthe IRS review of the Criminal Investigation Division is a most \nwelcome choice.\n    It demonstrates a willingness to address the concerns that \nare being raised by our efforts at oversight and is another \nmanifestation of Commissioner Rossotti's dedication to change \nthe way the IRS does business.\n    One agenda item that I would like to see Mr. Webster add to \nhis review concerns placing these CID employees who are trained \nto use intrusive and oppressive law enforcement techniques \nagainst violent criminals under the direction of our agencies \nthat are experienced at combatting such individuals. These \nagencies would include the FBI and DEA.\n    Now, as we heard yesterday it is wrong to use these kinds \nof aggressive tactics in routine criminal tax investigations of \nAmericans who are neither dangerous nor violent. At every turn \nwe must work to promote an agency that puts service and \nefficiency before intimidation and vindictive behavior, and \nthat is what these hearings are all about.\n    Senator Moynihan?"

"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Mr. Chairman, I could not more agree \nabout the testimony we heard yesterday in which we encountered \nmembers of, how shall I say, the armed forces of the Internal \nRevenue Service dealing with citizens involved in a dispute \nwith the government over taxes, which is a normal thing.\n    There is a migration of these SWAT team techniques in our \ngovernment and we have to be careful about it. I think Judge \nWebster would be very responsive to your thoughts, he having \nheaded the FBI, of course, and being a judge, and the CIA.\n    The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms is in the \nTreasury Department, so there is a possibility of that kind of \ntrade, and they should pursue it with energy and listen to this \ncommittee's concern that the boundary between litigation and \npara-military activities on behalf of fundraising by the \nFederal Government ought to be clearly defined.\n    So I thank you again.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Moynihan.\n    It is a pleasure to have Senator Chafee here. Senator \nChafee?"

break,break,break,break
"","","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Mr. Colaprete. Good morning, Senators. My name is John \nColaprete and I am from Virginia Beach, Virginia. I am in the \nrestaurant business. I am also a husband, a father, a veteran, \nhaving served my country proudly as a U.S. Marine Corps captain \nfrom 1965 to 1969.\n    I have never been in any sort of trouble with the law, and \nI believe that every American has an obligation to pay their \nfair share of income taxes. I have never failed to meet that \nobligation.\n    I have always considered myself both patriotic and a law-\nabiding citizen. I will always be a law-abiding citizen. \nHowever, I feel I have literally been punished for upholding \nthe laws of the Nation I swore an allegiance to honor and \ndefend.\n    Four years ago, I employed a bookkeeper in my restaurant \nwho eventually embezzled approximately $40,000 from the \nbusiness. She went to prison for her crimes, but not before \nturning my life and the lives of countless others upside down.\n    With the full cooperation of the Internal Revenue Service, \nthis woman, a multiple felon who already had an outstanding \nwarrant for her arrest, managed not once, but twice, to \nvictimize me, my family, partners, employees, and patrons and \nothers of the business community who depended upon me and my \nbusiness.\n    This dance with the devil began in March of 1994, when my \npartner and I became aware that we were being swindled by our \nbookkeeper. When we discovered substantial shortages in our \naccounts, we confronted her and she admitted to stealing from \nour business.\n    She told us she would make restitution. Unfortunately, \nrather than make restitution she sought shelter with the IRS \nand told them a fantastic tale of money laundering, gun \nrunning, and drug dealing by my partner and I.\n    Little did I know that the IRS would spend less than 48 \nhours investigating my bookkeeper's allegations before \nconducting raids on my businesses, my home, and the home of my \nmanager. Little did I know that the government that I had so \nproudly served would accept these allegations to be true, \ndespite the alarming lack of substantiation, probable cause, or \nproof of any sort whatsoever.\n    Little did I know that the IRS, when faced with the \noutrageous claim that I had thousands of pounds of cocaine \nstored like cord wood in my office, would subscribe to a policy \nof guilty until proven innocent.\n    This was not a matter of an honest mistake. In fact, a \nrecently retired FBI agent divulged in a deposition taken for \nthe case that I have pending against the IRS that he had \nadvised all involved to be skeptical about the claims of my \naccuser. The FBI specifically declined to become involved and, \nin the words of one of its agents, the whole story sounded like \na grade B movie.\n    On the morning that both my home and businesses were \nraided, raids executed solely on the word of my ex-bookkeeper, \nI was in church for the occasion of my son's first Holy \nCommunion.\n    Armed agents, accompanied by drug-sniffing dogs, stormed my \nrestaurants during breakfast, ordered patrons out of the \nrestaurant, and began interrogating my employees.\n    The IRS impounded my records, my cash registers, and my \ncomputers. Since the raids, we have managed to get up and \nrunning despite what can easily be perceived as our own \ngovernment's best attempts to put us out of business.\n    Today, I still wonder how such a thing can happen. But I \nknow it does. I would like you to know that for every taxpayer \nlike me, those who have survived armed assaults on our \nbusinesses and our homes, there are perhaps several thousands \nof taxpayers who, in fear, lick their wounds, tally their \nlosses, and consider themselves lucky that the IRS has finally \nleft them alone, their innocence notwithstanding.\n    I have nothing to hide and I will never consider myself \nlucky when I ponder the events of the last four years. As for \nthe taxpayers who have suffered similar injustices at the hands \nof the IRS, I hear from these people every week. They seek me \nout and relate horror stories that at one time would evoke from \nme nothing more than simple skepticism. I used to believe that \nsuch things could only happen in a communistic bloc country or \npolice state. I do not believe that any more.\n    When the raid occurred at my home, the front door was torn \nfrom the hinges, my dogs were impounded, along with my safe and \n12 years of my personal income tax returns and supporting \ndocuments.\n    When that safe was finally returned, an heirloom watch that \nI had received as a gift from my late father was missing. In \nthe aftermath of the raid, I returned to find my home in \nshambles. It was if I had been burglarized, both in appearance \nand in the sense of having been grossly violated.\n    While my restaurant and my home were being raided by armed \nagents of the Internal Revenue Service, a raid was also being \nconducted on the home of my manager. In that raid, my manager \nwas pulled at gunpoint from the shower and forcibly restrained \nwhile he attempted to call an attorney. His teen-aged son was \nknocked to the floor.\n    His daughter, 14 years old at the time, had several friends \nover for a slumber party the night before. These young girls \nhad to get dressed under the watchful eyes of male agents, \ndespite the presence of female agents. The IRS agent stood in \nthe doorway to the bedroom, gun drawn, refusing these young \ngirls even a semblance of privacy. We were never charged with \nany crimes.\n    After scrutinizing our records for 4 months, the IRS \nreturned most of them. A rental truck pulled up in front of my \nbusiness 1 day and the items that were returned were basically \ndumped in a pile for us to sort through. I never received an \napology.\n    Following the raids, I could get no answers as to why all \nof this occurred. I was met with, ``No comment, Mr. \nColaprete,'' at every turn. Freedom of Information requests \nwere ignored, ostensibly due to a backlog of such requests and \ndespite legally mandated time limits on such requests.\n    Two newspapers in Virginia Beach made repeated requests \nunder the Freedom of Information Act, only to have the Justice \nDepartment thumb its nose at those requests. When an \ninvestigative journalist began to get to the bottom of things, \nhe was also subjected to the harassment of the IRS.\n    He had an opportunity to interview Special Agent Carol \nWillman from the IRS office in Norfolk, Virginia. During that \ninterview, Ms. Willman interrupted the reporter's inquiries \nwith a demand for his Social Security number.\n    Within the year, he was notified that the IRS wanted to \naudit his return. When a local publication reported this, the \naudit was abruptly canceled. An IRS agent stated at the time \nthat the agency does not retaliate against citizens through the \nuse of audits, but the facts would seem to indicate otherwise.\n    The ex-bookkeeper, meanwhile, was kept in protective \ncustody by the IRS in a motel up to the time of the raids. It \nis almost unimaginable that there could be such a level of \nincompetence at the IRS that they would not only take the word \nof this woman and begin any sort of investigation, but they \nwould shield her from the authorities who were trying to arrest \nher.\n    The woman whom the IRS was protecting and on whom they had \nrelied had already been convicted numerous times of embezzling \nand stealing. In fact, the outstanding criminal charge pending \nagainst her at the time she approached the IRS was for a crime \ninvolving lying and stealing.\n    Ironically, just a week before this woman approached the \nIRS I had specifically gone to the police and filed a complaint \nagainst her, alleging that she had lied, stolen, and embezzled \nfrom me. In the face of all that, how could anyone, let alone \nsupposedly trained, professional inspectors with the IRS accept \nat face value what the woman was saying?\n    Based on her word, she, Carol Willman, not only commenced \nan investigation but completely shut down a business and turned \nthe lives of innocent people upside down less than 48 hours \nafter first meeting this woman.\n    Is there such a competitive atmosphere within the IRS to \nadd another feather in their cap that they would ignore not \nonly basic investigative techniques, but the obvious flaws in \nthis woman's character and simply accept her at face value?\n    It is frightening that such a woman could have conned the \nIRS into believing that her employer, despite all appearances \nto the contrary, was a high-level gangster, and then shield her \nfrom the law in the belief that she would lead them to a bigger \nfish like me.\n    To compound this vigilante or lynch mob approach that the \nIRS had adopted, they then allowed her to leave the \njurisdiction of Virginia to go to North Carolina, where she was \nonly later sent to jail for embezzling from three other \nemployers in that State.\n    On the surface it might appear that she acted alone, but \nthis just is not so. The IRS was her partner in crime, first \nacting in concert to destroy my life, then allowing her to flee \nthe State and victimize others.\n    I looked for answers and was rebuffed at every turn. I \nsuffered a deep depression that lasted a year. I was \nimmobilized. I could not get out of bed some days. My neighbors \nshunned me. My wife, who is an artist, has not been able to \npick up a paintbrush in 4 years.\n    My children were taunted at school and told that their \nfather was a gangster and a drug dealer. I raised my children \nwith a zero tolerance for dishonesty, and now they must hear \nallegations that I am a major drug dealer and a tax cheat? I am \nhere to tell you, I am none of those things.\n    Relatively speaking, the trauma that has befallen me is \nmild compared to what has happened to my manager. He has \nsuffered severe depression, sought counseling from his pastor, \nliterally been shunned by friends and acquaintances, and has \nyet to get his life back in order. He has been ruined \nfinancially and emotionally, with little or no hope of ever \ngetting his life back to where it was prior to these raids.\n    I am also here to tell you that we cannot treat our \ncitizens this way, not in America. I have been repeatedly \nvictimized over the past 4 years, primarily by a government tax \nagency that is funded with my tax dollars.\n    If Americans have a perception of the IRS as a bogeyman, it \nis because the IRS itself has promoted that perception through \npolicies that are fundamentally unconstitutional and illegal. \nThis is not a partisan issue, this is a people issue. This is a \nfreedom issue.\n    I have a lawsuit pending against the IRS and I will not \nrest until I have my day in court. The IRS's response to that \nlawsuit has been to cast doubt on my character by insinuating \nthat they did find some evidence of wrongdoing, but they chose \nnot to prosecute it.\n    If I was guilty of anything, why would they choose not to \nprosecute? While any allegations will eventually be shown in \ncourt to be what they are, a smoke screen, until I get into \ncourt to prove my case these allegations linger in the \ncommunity where I live and work and continue to compound my \nfrustration.\n    The system does not work for the American taxpayer. The \ntotal sense of violation that we have experienced has had a \ndevastating effect on us all. In the wake of all this, I find \nthat there is no system in place to defend me, or others like \nme. I would like to believe that someone takes responsibility \nfor what has happened, for what continues to happen every day \nin this country.\n    If the example we ought to set for our citizens is one of \nno accountability and no remorse, then our form of government, \nthe oldest surviving democracy on the planet, cannot survive \nmuch longer.\n    A day does not go by that I do not wonder what harassment \nwill occur next. I would like to know why this dark entity \nknown as the IRS has come into my life and refused to leave. So \nwho protects me in this system? Who cares about my \nconstitutional rights? Not the courts. Not the IRS. I am hoping \nthat the buck stops here with you, Senator Roth, and this \ncommittee.\n    I leave you with three questions, Senators. Why did this \nhappen? What will you do to see that it never happens again to \ninnocent taxpaying citizens? We cannot employ inexperienced and \nimmature people to play God with the lives of taxpayers, IRS \nagents who decide that it is a beautiful day to go out and \ndestroy someone's life.\n    Finally, once this ordeal has ended and I have obtained a \nverdict in a court of law and a judgment against the IRS, what \nwill you do to assure me that the IRS pays the judgment rather \nthan continue to beat me into submission through endless \nappeals and an outright refusal to pay the judgment that I \nobtained?\n    In this great democracy we have created this entity to \ncollect taxes, which we all agree must exist. However, we have \nempowered the agency to be subject to no one, to no laws, to no \nchecks and balances, and all of us, including each one of you, \nare afraid of them. Why should we fear the very people we \nemploy?\n    When these hearings began last September I was told that \nSenator Roth would conduct these hearings because he has no \nfear. After my ordeal, I have no fear any longer. But when \nAmericans receive that letter with the logo of the IRS in the \nupper left-hand corner, their pulse rate, their heart beat, and \ntheir blood pressure rises. There is genuine fear. This fear \nmust stop.\n    Thank you for giving me this opportunity, Senators.\n    The Chairman. Well, thank you, Mr. Colaprete.\n    Let me just say that no law-abiding American should have to \ngo through this ordeal. That is the reason we are here today. \nWe are here today to hear the experiences of people like you so \nthat we can reform the process to ensure that the American \ntaxpayer is treated in a fair and equitable manner. That is the \nwhole purpose of these hearings. I appreciate your courage in \ncoming here and telling us your story.\n    Mr. Gardner, you are next."

"","","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","                  STATEMENT OF RICHARD GARDNER"
break,break,break,break
"","","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Mr. Gardner. Good morning, Senators. My name is Richard \nGardner. I graduated from the University of Tulsa with a BS \ndegree in accounting. I am a Vietnam veteran, having served in \nthe U.S. Army from 1967 to 1969.\n    In December of 1976, I started Gardner's Tax Service, Inc., \nlocated in Tulsa, Oklahoma. According to the U.S. Federal \nAttorney, my company prepares between 4,500 and 6,000 tax \nreturns a year, making my tax service one of the largest in the \nState.\n    I appreciate the opportunity of being here today in order \nto tell you about my ordeal with the IRS. While this experience \nhas affected me and my family greatly, this is also a story \nabout how the IRS will not spare anyone, even individuals \nremotely connected to the taxpayers in question, from unfair \ntreatment, intimidation, and threats.\n    My personal nightmare began on March 29, 1995. I was in my \ntax office in Tulsa doing a couple's tax return when one of my \nassistants called me to the phone to tell me that an IRS agent \nwanted to see me and was waiting outside my door for me.\n    I went out to meet the agent and was greeted by \napproximately 15 IRS agents and between 5 and 8 U.S. Federal \nMarshalls. They were all armed and they were wearing those \njackets that say in bright letters ``IRS'' or ``U.S. Marshall'' \non the back.\n    One of the IRS special agents directed me into one of my \nother offices, handed me a search warrant, and said, ``we are \nseizing all of your client tax returns, computers, large \nprinters, personal papers, and other records.''\n    He then said, ``I want you to make a phone call for us. I \nwill tell you what to say. We will tape it. If you will do this \nfor us, we will ask the judge to be lenient on you \nsentencing.''\n    What was this special agent ordering me to do? For me to \ncall another accountant who did my electronic filing for my \nclients for a charge that I, in turn, billed my clients for. In \nessence, the agent was using me to set up the accountant to \ndeliberately get him into trouble.\n    After I refused to comply and the event with the telephone \nended, the seizure of my office property continued. Please \nunderstand, at the time of this raid the IRS had no complaints \nagainst me that I was aware of, or any complaints from any of \nthe over 90,000 tax returns my office had prepared in the last \n22 years.\n    Following the raid, I went out and bought a new computer, \nnew software, and I reopened the next morning at 8:00 a.m. \npreparing tax returns. At about 9:00 a.m., the same agent \ncalled my assistant, telling her that he thought the office \nwould have closed down.\n    My attorney at the time told me, ``in 99 percent of the \nFederal cases, when they raid your place of business, they have \nalready indicted you, or will in a few days.'' In my case, it \ntook nearly 2 years. It took until March 22, 1997 for this \nepisode with the IRS to come to a head. It was a terrible \nstrain on me, my family, and my employees.\n    The entire case of the IRS against me would extract a \nterrible toll. It was the intent of the IRS to break me \nemotionally and financially over what eventually would be a \ntotal of 33 months so that I would plead guilty to at least one \ncount each of bankruptcy and tax fraud.\n    I would like to lead you through some of the experiences \nthat my family and I was forced to endure over the course of \nthese 2 years. Between the time of the raid on March 29, 1995 \nand the 23 Federal count indictment delivered on March 22, \n1997, this same special agent and the IRS took the following \nactions against me.\n    They tried to force some of my clients to wear hidden \nmicrophones into my tax office to record me, and when they \nrefused, the special agent became angry and hinted, as a result \nof their refusal, that they too might experience some problems \nwith the IRS.\n    My employees were threatened with the loss of their jobs \nand were informed that they could buy out my tax business \ncheaply, since I would soon be out of business.\n    In February 1997, the special agent informed me that I \nwould be out of business by that April, since all of my papers \nhad been sent to Washington and the IRS approval to shut me \ndown had been obtained.\n    My wife, Soccoro, was forced to endure an unnecessary \nappearance before a grand jury. The IRS lied to the grand jury \non the indictment. Many of the 18 tax clients listed on the \ngrand jury indictment never knew anything about it.\n    One of my clients was surprised to learn from me that his \nname was on the list, especially since he had never appeared \nbefore the grand jury. Many of these clients were surprised to \nlearn of their names being on their list. Also, some of those \nhad advised the IRS agents that there had been no problems with \ntheir returns.\n    Lastly, in March of 1997, two of my employees had to visit \nthe office of the special agent to retrieve some client files \nconfiscated in the raid some 2 years before.\n    When they asked the special agent if he had a vendetta \nagainst me, he replied, ``I've had a personal vendetta against \nRichard Gardner for 15 years.'' Keep in mind, I never knew this \nspecial agent until he came into my life in my office on March \n29, 1995.\n    In the end, the IRS had put between three and five agents \nworking on my case and had supposedly put between 6,000 and \n8,000 tax returns on its computers in an attempt to show fraud, \nand failed.\n    The IRS examined between 35,000 and 45,000 of my client tax \nreturns for fraud, and failed. It had questioned hundreds of my \nclients, threatening them, and spent hundreds of thousands of \ndollars to prove wrongdoing, and failed.\n    When it came right down to actually going to court, the IRS \ncaved in. The IRS knew it could not win a case based upon \nfabrication, false, and non-existent testimony. Yet, the \nJustice Department indicted me anyway in March of 1997 on 23 \nFederal counts.\n    Please understand that all 23 of these counts were handled \nand investigated by the same special agent who had visited my \noffice in March of 1995. Even then this special agent had so \nmany problems with these indictments the IRS had to reconvene \nanother grand jury in May of 1997 and have me re-indicted.\n    Finally, on December 4, 1997, the Justice Department \ndropped two counts against me. On January 5, 1998, in Federal \nCourt, all of the other counts against me were dropped and the \ncase was dismissed.\n    The IRS admitted in Federal Court what I stated earlier, \nthat I prepared between 4,500 and 6,000 tax returns annually \nand that I am one of the largest independent tax services in \nOklahoma. It appears the IRS wanted a high-profile, guilty-\neven-if-you-are-not victim to use to scare other tax preparers \nand taxpayers.\n    As you can imagine, to live under the threat of prison for \n33 months has been terrible and has exacted a very high toll. I \nfeel that if the Congress did not hold these hearings, the IRS \nwould continue as always.\n    Thank you for hearing my story.\n    The Chairman. Well, thank you, Mr. Gardner, for being here \ntoday. As I have said on several occasions, these hearings \nwould not have been possible if it were not for the courage of \ntaxpayers and employees of IRS who appear here at great \npersonal risk.\n    Senator Gramm. Mr. Chairman?\n    The Chairman. Yes. I will call on you next. Mr. Moncrief is \nour next witness, and our Senator from Texas would like to make \na few comments.\n    Senator Gramm. Mr. Chairman, thank you for recognizing me. \nTex Moncrief is an old and dear friend of mine. When we first \nstarted these hearings, Tex contacted me saying he wanted to \ntestify. I told him that I remembered his case and that it \nobviously was exactly the kind of thing that we were looking \nfor, but that he ought to think through doing this because, by \ntestifying, obviously his case is in the public domain and \npeople have a right, and some will feel an obligation, to try \nto portray it in the most negative light. Tex was determined \nthat he wanted to come, and I just wanted people to understand \nthat. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Well, I appreciate the fact that you are here \ntoday, Mr. Moncrief. Please proceed."

"","","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Mr. Moncrief. Mr. Chairman and distinguished gentlemen of \nthis committee, I consider it an honor and a privilege to \nappear before you today.\n    In my imagination, Federal raids were always confined to \nMafia bosses and drug lords. If you had told me that 64 IRS \nagents would storm my office with sidearms holstered and \nbootheels trampling my civil rights and my business reputation, \nI would not have believed you. I am a graduate petroleum \nengineer, a former World War II naval officer, and a second-\ngeneration Texas oilman.\n    My father was a World War I army officer and a highly \nrespected and successful oil and gas explorer. My family and I \nare patriots and law-abiding Americans. We have given tens of \nmillions of dollars away to medicine, the homeless, and the \nneedy, and pay many millions of dollars in taxes every year.\n    But on the morning of September 1, 1994, the IRS raided the \nFort Worth office of my family-run oil company. Making sure my \nemployees saw their guns, they stormed the offices like an army \nlanding on an enemy beachfront.\n    My employees heard the agents shout, ``IRS! This business \nis under criminal investigation. Remove your hands from the \nkeyboards and back away from the computers, and remember, we \nare armed.''\n    They rummaged through every inch of our building, breaking \ninto offices, barking orders like, ``Open the doors, or we'll \nknock them down.'' One special agent told my son that he could \nblow the hinges off his safe if he would not open it. Agents \neven removed sheetrock from the walls, as if they were looking \nfor illegal drugs. They herded my employees down to a first-\nfloor dining room, treating them like criminals. No food, no \nphone calls, and for some, no chairs.\n    My entire staff at the time consisted of less than 35 \npeople, mostly women. That is a ratio of nearly two armed \nagents per employee. One employee commented, for the first time \nin my life I feel bad to be an American. I was humiliated and \nbranded a criminal before anyone in the IRS bothered to \nconsider that I had not done anything wrong.\n    Although these investigations are supposed to be \nconfidential, someone with inside information alerted the \nmedia. This ensured maximum coverage and maximum embarrassment. \nNews of the raid was broadcast on radio, TV, and in newspapers \nfrom coast to coast. It sent my business reputation into a \ntailspin, and in my business a good reputation is about the \nmost precious thing a man can have.\n    They left later in the day with over one million documents \nand an entire computer system. Virtually our whole company \nincluding records dating back to the 1970's was packed up in \nless than a day and moved to a warehouse in Dallas. For several \nmonths, when we needed to see a document, file, or have access \nto a checkbook to handle business, IRS agents checked us in and \nout of the warehouse like prisoners.\n    Our long nightmare had only begun. My family was \ninvestigated for more than 16 months. The Justice Department \nfinally offered to drop the criminal investigation after I had \nspent millions of dollars in legal and accounting fees, roughly \n$5.5 million, to prove that we had committed no crime.\n    But the IRS would not go unless we paid a large, \narbitrarily determined sum which was, in my opinion, plain \nextortion. IRS also demanded that we sign releases promising \nnot to sue its agents and every other government employee who \nhad ever touched the case for violating our civil rights under \nthe Fourth Amendment of the constitution, and other Federal \nlaws. We gave in to these demands, beaten for well over a year \ninto submission and threatened with more of the same.\n    I am one of the few taxpayers blessed with the resources to \nfight back against IRS abuse and Gestapo-like tactics. The IRS \nmust be held accountable to the people it is supposed to serve. \nI am here today in the hopes that this committee will take \nsteps to prevent what happened to my family and me from \nhappening to any other American.\n    Here is my story. The September 1, 1994 IRS raid came about \nas the result of a plot hatched by our former chief in-house \naccountant while he was working for us and supposedly \noverseeing our accounting and the preparation of our tax \nreturns.\n    About 2 years before the raid, he began stealing \ninformation from our files and enlisting a group of well-\nconnected former IRS, Justice Department, and Treasury \nDepartment officials to help him. In March of 1993, they \napproached the highest level of the IRS, the Acting IRS Chief \nCounsel, the number one lawyer at the IRS, with a plan.\n    While this accountant was still working in our offices \nevery day, he secretly had his well-connected co-conspirators \ntravel here to Washington to meet the Acting Chief Counsel at \nthe IRS National Office. They used their connections to entice \nthe IRS to throw its full, terrifying weight against us in \nexchange for money, and lots of it.\n    In June of 1993, I fired the accountant for incompetence, \ngiving him a generous severance and an automobile. I never \nguessed that his scheme to ruin me and make himself rich at my \nexpense was already well under way.\n    On November 9, 1993, the IRS District Director in Dallas \nsigned an agreement to pay our former in-house accountant as \nmuch as a $25 million bounty, his share of the money he told \nthe IRS to expect to take from us.\n    Our former accountant, in turn, signed a contract with the \nformer Justice Department, IRS, and Treasury lawyers who had \nhelped them, promising to pay each of them a share of this huge \nIRS reward.\n    At the same time, these conspirators took the stolen \ninformation to prospective plaintiffs and their lawyers and \nused it to generate spurious private, but ultimately futile, \nlawsuits seeking outrageous damages from us.\n    Anyone could have seen that these people had a financial \nstake in destroying me, but the IRS accepted them and their \nstory without bothering to investigate their motives or \nhonesty.\n    All too happy to accept this information, the IRS never \nbothered to inquire how its informer got it or whether it was \ntrue before launching its massive raid. It could have checked \nour former accountant's claims by employing the usual, but far \nless intimidating or intrusive, practice of sending an agent \nover to our office to audit our financial records.\n    I still do not know why it chose not to issue us a summons \nor a subpoena. Had it done either, we would never have had to \nendure this nightmare. There was one enormous problem with all \nof this: we had committed no crime.\n    Not long after the raid, the Justice Department began to \nrealize that our former accountant lacked credibility and that \nhis motives and conduct were highly suspect. However, the IRS \nwould not quit. Spurred on by conspirators chasing a $25 \nmillion reward, IRS agents terrorized our employees, knocking \non their doors after work, and scaring most of them to death. \nThe pressure on our loyal, hardworking employees was intense.\n    Many of them were working well into the nights and on \nweekends trying to help our lawyers and accountants figure out \nwhat the IRS was told we had done wrong, while simultaneously \ntrying to keep up with our regular business. That was the \ntoughest part, there was no new business. An independent oil \ncompany's most precious asset is its reputation. Ours was shot \nto heck. The damage to our family business and reputation was \nenormous.\n    The emotional damage was even greater. One of our \naccountants was hospitalized and placed on medication for high \nblood pressure. Another key employee who had worked for us for \n17 years stated under oath that she was so terrified and \nintimidated by the IRS agents that she agreed to work for them \nin the evenings to help them go through our accounting records.\n    Our former accountant offered that same employee a share of \nhis IRS informer's fee the night before she was to testify in \nthe grand jury in the hope that she would support his baseless \nallegations.\n    It may be hard to believe, but IRS agents even subpoenaed \nmy college transcript and those of two of my sons. I am \nconvinced that they did this to get around the non-disclosure \nlaws, embarrass, and intimidate us. Why else would they tell \nour alma maters, the institution we attended years ago and now \nserve as trustees, that we were under grand jury investigation?\n    Ultimately, the truth won out because I was fortunate to \nhave the means to fight back. Over the U.S. Government's strong \nopposition, we sought to take the sworn depositions in a civil \nlawsuit of the men who had conspired against us.\n    An Assistant U.S. Attorney actually made an appearance in \nTexas State Court, but failed to block the depositions. It was \nthen that the conspirators and the IRS's scheme came apart. Our \nformer in-house accountant claimed the Fifth Amendment \nprivilege and refused to be deposed on the ground that truthful \ntestimony might incriminate him.\n    His lawyer, the former U.S. Attorney for the Northern \nDistrict of Texas and one of the beneficiaries named in the IRS \nreward-sharing agreement, suggested in open court that he might \nhave to do the same. At this point when the entire scheme was \nbackfiring, the Justice Department offered to settle the \ninvestigation.\n    It got back to us that, even though its extravagantly paid \ninformer had disgraced both the IRS and himself, the IRS would \nnot stop tearing our lives apart for less than $300 million, \nwhich, in a matter of weeks, dropped to $100 million, then $24 \nmillion, and finally $23 million.\n    Although the IRS never bothered to conduct a civil audit to \nfind out whether we owed one additional set of tax, it called \nthe $23 million it extracted from us additional taxes and \ninterest.\n    It was, in fact, nothing more than an amount arbitrarily \ndemanded from me, various family business members, our \nbusiness, and our charitable foundation to let the U.S. \nAttorney issue a press release praising the IRS Criminal \nInvestigation Division for what it had done to us.\n    But money and a press release were not all it wanted. \nDespite the fact that its informer's originally, highly \ncompensated allegations were false, the IRS refused to quit. It \ndemanded that we sign releases promising not to sue the agency \nitself and every government employee who had violated our \nrights. I did not like this arrangement, but it was clear to me \nthat if I did not agree the IRS would investigate our family \nbusiness to its demise and me to my grave.\n    When we learned the truth about our former accountant's \nextortionate plan we asked the U.S. Attorney and the IRS \nInspection Division to investigate. They resisted. First, IRS \nInspection took a half-hearted look at the case, but closed \nthat investigation without taking the time to interview me or \nmy sons to find out what had happened. But we kept pressing. We \nacquired more evidence. A new investigation was opened.\n    A new IRS inspector recommended that my former accountant \nbe prosecuted, but no action has been taken. It is shocking \nthat no IRS inspector has bothered to take action against the \nIRS case agents and supervisors who thoughtlessly accepted and \nviciously pursued the false accusations made by our greed-\ndriven former accountant.\n    Our government has consistently stonewalled our efforts to \nobtain internal documents disclosing the truth. A Federal judge \nin Fort Worth recently tired of the government's effort to hide \nthe facts. He ordered the government to give us all the \ninformation we had asked for and to pay attorney's fees to \ncompensate us for the burdens it had placed upon our efforts to \nseek out the truth.\n    The past 4 years have taken a personal and emotional toll \nthat can never be restored. It is my hope that our suffering \ncan be used as a mirror reflecting the need to reform an IRS \nthat is completely out of control. Put yourself, for a moment, \nin my shoes.\n    Your former accountant, a person you trusted for years to \noversee the accounting and tax preparation for your business \nand fired because he was not doing the job, bargains for an \nincredible IRS reward, falsely tells the IRS you evaded as much \nas $300 million in taxes, and uses stolen information to \ngenerate private lawsuits against you.\n    Armed IRS agents tear apart your offices, terrorize your \nemployees, go public with the case, and after a long, \npersonally and professionally painful investigation, inevitably \ncome up empty-handed.\n    There were no apologies, no public corrections of the \nrecord, and no efforts to right the wrongs. In the end, the IRS \nwas concerned about one thing, getting a release from liability \nfor itself and its agents.\n    What about civil rights? This was a clear-cut case for \nserious self-examination by the IRS. But the IRS did its best \nto cover its tracks, protect itself from ever having to answer \nfor its actions, and move on to another investigation on \nanother, preferably defenseless, taxpayer.\n    I am here today to ask you to call an end to this kind of \nabuse and ensure that what happened to us never again happens \nto another innocent American. Thank you very much, gentlemen.\n    Mr. Moncrief, I thank you for being here. Again, I say it \nis outrageous. It is outrageous that any lawful American should \nhave to go through this kind of experience, and I just want to \nagain express my appreciation to you, and to the three of you, \nfor being here today. Our whole purpose is to seek to assure \nfair treatment to the American people.\n    Now, Mr. Colaprete, I will start with you, if I may. The \nquestion must be asked, were you or any of your partners \ntrafficking in illegal drugs out of your restaurant?\n    Mr. Colaprete. Absolutely not.\n    The Chairman. Absolutely not.\n    Mr. Colaprete. Emphatically not. I do not know how strong \nof words I can use for something so outrageous.\n    The Chairman. Now, Mr. Colaprete, 2 days is not a very long \ntime. But, based on just 2 days of investigation, as I \nunderstand your testimony, the IRS raided your business, going \nso far as to take a fork out of the hands of one of your \ncustomers, tearing the front door off the hinges of your home, \nransacking your house.\n    Now, after all this mayhem, did anyone from the IRS explain \nto you why they took less than 48 hours to investigate the \nclaims brought against you before they descended on you and \nyour business?\n    Mr. Colaprete. No, sir. The IRS had no contact with me. As \na matter of fact, by making inroads to find out just those \nquestions, I was met with, ``No comment, Mr. Colaprete,'' as \nthough you are a criminal, we do not talk to criminals.\n    The Chairman. Now, let me ask you this. After the IRS \ninvestigated your books and records, were you assessed any sort \nof penalty or were you notified that any taxes were due?\n    Mr. Colaprete. No, sir.\n    The Chairman. How long prior to the raid had you reported \nyour bookkeeper's activities to the authorities?\n    Mr. Colaprete. Prior to the raids, I contacted the Virginia \nBeach Police 10 days prior to the raids with the evidence of \nthis embezzlement.\n    The Chairman. Ten days.\n    Mr. Colaprete. Ten days.\n    The Chairman. Let me turn to you, Mr. Gardner.\n    Mr. Gardner. Yes, Senator.\n    The Chairman. Had you received any advance notice from the \nIRS of any problem they had experienced with your current or \nprevious tax returns prior to the CID raid?\n    Mr. Gardner. No, sir, nothing at all.\n    The Chairman. None at all.\n    Mr. Gardner. No, never.\n    The Chairman. Now, is it your testimony that the IRS \nactually listed witnesses in the grand jury indictment against \nyou who had never, never been involved with the case; is that \ncorrect?\n    Mr. Gardner. Yes, sir.\n    The Chairman. How do you explain that?\n    Mr. Gardner. Well, for example, one of my clients listed on \nthe indictment sheet contacted me and informed me that the IRS \nhad called him a year and a half before and talked to him for \nabout 20 minutes. The agent told my client that if he did not \ngive them the evidence they wanted, he might also have some \nproblems with the IRS.\n    He was not the only one. There were about 10 other clients \nthat were also threatened this way that were on the grand jury \nindictment. These clients for whom the IRS claimed I filed \nillegal tax returns came back year after year to have their tax \nreturns prepared by me, even after the alleged illegal returns \nwere filed. Obviously, they did not think I had done anything \nwrong, and these clients were the ones that the IRS was \nbuilding their case on.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Gardner, since the time the indictments \nagainst you were dismissed earlier this year, have you received \nany policy or any explanation from the IRS for the raid?\n    Mr. Gardner. No, sir.\n    The Chairman. None whatsoever?\n    Mr. Gardner. None whatsoever.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Moncrief, there must have been some cause \nfor the initial effort to investigate you in the first case. \nWhat do you believe this was?\n    Mr. Moncrief. I know of no reason why the IRS investigated \nus. We had no notice, nothing. I have no reason why it should \nhave occurred.\n    The Chairman. No reason whatsoever.\n    Mr. Moncrief. No, sir.\n    The Chairman. Why do you believe the IRS served the \nUniversity of Texas with a subpoena for your college \ntranscripts? Now, it is true you were a regent at the \nUniversity of Texas, at least up to 1 year prior to the IRS \nraid.\n    Mr. Moncrief. Yes, sir.\n    The Chairman. Why do you think the IRS notified them?\n    Mr. Moncrief. Well, I thought about it at the time. It was \nnot because I was a Tau Beta Pi, the honorary engineering \nprofession, although I was later named a distinguished engineer \nand graduate, but I think it was undoubtedly due to embarrass \nme, because as soon as they had contacted the registrar, Dr. \nCunningham, who was the chancellor, called me. Then pretty soon \nmost everybody in the university knew it, and then it gets \naround Austin, Texas, and all around the State of Texas. So I \nthink it was to embarrass me.\n    his kind of a raid was supposed to be confidential, and \nwhat they did was supposed to be confidential. But by going and \ngetting my transcript, it could be used as public information, \nso I think it was to embarrass me.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Moncrief, you paid $23 million at the \nconclusion of your case. That is a lot of money. If you were \nnot guilty of any charges by the IRS, why did you pay such a \nlarge amount of money?\n    Mr. Moncrief. Well, the IRS wanted to settle the case. They \nwanted to settle the case, but they wanted a substantial amount \nof money. We had it on pretty good authority that if we did not \nsettle, they were going to keep after us, just year, after \nyear, after year, and harass us, trying to find something \nwrong.\n    That would have been hard to put up with and might have, as \nI said in my statement, chased me to the grave. So I finally \nagreed to pay this $23 million, which had come down from $300 \nmillion, for the welfare----\n    The Chairman. Their initial demand was $300 million?\n    Mr. Moncrief. Originally they said it was a $300 million \ntax case, which I assume they figured they might get because \nthey were going to pay the accountant $25 million. But I did \nthat for the welfare of my family and so I could get back to \nrunning the successful oil business that we had. I mean, it was \nruining our life and I decided to do that and then go ahead and \npursue things like I am still doing today.\n    The Chairman. Let me ask you this. Was there ever an audit \ndone on your taxes for the years in question, or an assessment \nnotice provided you for any amount of taxes?\n    Mr. Moncrief. No, sir.\n    The Chairman. None whatsoever?\n    Mr. Moncrief. None whatsoever.\n    The Chairman. Senator Moynihan."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Wow! Gentlemen, thank you for your \ntestimony. I said at the opening remarks, and I just think we \nhave heard confirmation, that we have to be much concerned \nabout the para-military performance of the Internal Revenue \nService.\n    I mean, one is aware of it, but thinks of it as marginal \nand having to do with cooperative involvement with drug \nenforcement, which is also in the Treasury Department. Clearly, \nit is not. Clearly, if armed agents can appear in these scenes \nwhere there is no issue of violence, it is government violence \ndirected against citizenry.\n    I think we have to ask Judge Webster to look into that with \nthe specific concern of, are civil rights being violated in a \nmost egregious mode, as would seem to be the case in each of \nwhat you have described.\n    I have one other thought, Mr. Chairman, and that is the \nrole of the Justice Department. Are they sensitive to these \nmatters, and in particular the U.S. Attorneys? I think we as \nSenators had better pay attention to that because, although it \nis not widely understood, U.S. Senators choose U.S. Attorneys. \nI have been here 22 years, and I so attest. Am I not right, \nsir?\n    The Chairman. You are absolutely correct."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    We choose U.S. Attorneys and have \nresponsibilities for our choice.\n    Mr. Gardner, you mentioned that at one point that the IRS \nconvened a second grand jury.\n    Mr. Gardner. Yes, sir."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Well, sir, it would have been the U.S. \nAttorney who convened it, as you know.\n    Mr. Gardner. That is correct."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    You referred to a grand jury indictment \nwhich had persons on it that ought not to have been there. That \nis the U.S. Attorney's choice. It may be something he has \ndeputized to a Deputy U.S. Attorney, but he is responsible.\n    It is the same case with you, Mr. Moncrief. I think the \nU.S. Attorney was involved in ways that one asks about their \ncompetence and their motivation. U.S. Attorneys have been known \nto rise to higher levels in public life, and the mode of \nindictment and convictions is well known.\n    I think we have to ask the Justice Department down here, \nsir. Are they paying heed to what the U.S. Attorneys are doing? \nWhat kind of discipline do they have over there? I would invite \nany comments you might have about that. Mr. Moncrief, you \nprobably knew that U.S. Attorney. Perhaps you did not, but you \ncertainly knew his name.\n    Mr. Moncrief. I did not quite catch that."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Well, the point is, the U.S. Attorneys \nare the ones who take these matters into criminal court, into a \ncriminal phase.\n    Mr. Moncrief. Yes, sir."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    What are their grounds and what are their \nrestraints, and what do they understand they are doing? How \nmuch do they just accept what the IRS gives them and go \nforward?\n    Mr. Moncrief. Well, I think, Senator Moynihan, they \naccepted our bookkeeper's allegations without even \ninvestigating, just in almost a matter of minutes. We have \ntried for 4 years to get the affidavit. There were supposed to \nhave been an affidavit that is sworn out by an informer where \nthey can get a search warrant, and we asked for that within \ndays after this raid happened.\n    We still have not gotten that affidavit, under the Freedom \nof Information Act or anything. We still do not know what this \ninformer said that caused this raid. I do not think that is \nright, after 4 years."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    I could not more agree. What I would \nwonder, is why does that U.S. Attorney still have his or her \njob? These are political appointments for which Senators are \nresponsible, and the Justice Department, and the President who \nsends their nomination? It is a formality, but it is real.\n    In your case, Mr. Gardner, did you have any feeling about \nthe U.S. Attorney's office taking anything like being prudent, \nas they ought to have been in your case?\n    Mr. Gardner. Senator Moynihan, I believe they just followed \nwhat the IRS agent said. I do not know if they really checked \nit out."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Well, that is not why they are appointed \nby the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate, not just to \ntake anything they are handed.\n    Mr. Gardner. Absolutely correct."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    And is there no disciplinary process for \nU.S. Attorneys?\n    The Chairman. There certainly should be."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    None of these gentlemen would have been \nin court without a U.S. Attorney taking them to a criminal \nindictment.\n    Mr. Moncrief. In my case, the bookkeeper had friends who \nwere employees of the IRS and the Justice Department that \ncooperated with him to set this up."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    That is called corruption.\n    Mr. Moncrief. Yes, sir. It really is."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    I hope the Attorney General is watching. \nI doubt it, but there is a Deputy Attorney General who is \nresponsible for the U.S. Attorneys. You cannot get into a \ncriminal situation without the Justice Department cooperating \nwith the IRS. That cooperation has to be something more than an \nautomatic transfer of, anything you say, we will indict and \nsend somebody else to jail.\n    I will put it this way, sir. These U.S. Attorneys are our \nappointments and our responsibility, and I think we should \nattend to it in a way we have not done previously. I am \nappalled with what I hear and I hope we will not leave it \nthere, and I am sure we will not, thanks to you, sir.\n    Thank you, gentlemen.\n    Mr. Colaprete. Senator Moynihan, in regards to my \nsituation, after 5 months of keeping my records and every part \nof my business, holding me in abeyance, we were contacted by \nthe U.S. Attorney, who told my attorney, we have no evidence of \nany crime, come get your things. Of course, at that point I \nsaid, well, you have all my things, you have looked at them, \nwhy don't you just keep them? But no, the next week they sent \nthem to me.\n    After that case, or whatever case they assumed they had was \nfinished, my question was, as a citizen now, since this is \nover, can I please see the reasons this occurred. That is, the \naffidavit. That was stonewalled for 2 years. The only reason I \nknow what is in that affidavit is because we are suing the \nInternal Revenue Service and finally a judge said, let them see \nthe affidavit.\n    The Justice Department and the IRS claimed that it was \nsensitive and that we could not see it. Freedom of Information \nrequests? They do not mean anything. I do not even understand \nwhat a Freedom of Information request is. It does not work. \nThey pick and choose what they want to show you, I guess, or \ngive you. But if you require something or request it legally \nand they do not want to give it to you, you are not getting it."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Well, I think the Department of Justice \nhas to look to its standards here. I would appreciate very \nmuch--we have a practice of asking you to give us something in \nwriting after your testimony--if we could have the names of the \nU.S. Attorneys involved.\n    Mr. Moncrief. Yes, sir, I believe so."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Just when you get a chance to send us a \nnote tomorrow or the next day.\n    Mr. Moncrief. Yes, sir. I certainly would, sir."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Thank you very much, gentlemen.\n    The Chairman. I would also urge, Senator Moynihan, that we \nrequest William Webster and his investigation of the CID, that \nit would be appropriate for him to look at the role of the U.S. \nAttorney."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Yes. Exactly. He having been a judge and \nhead of the FBI. Exactly.\n    The Chairman. Gentlemen, again, we appreciate very much \nyour being here today."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Mr. Chairman, are we going to be given an \nopportunity?\n    The Chairman. Oh, I am sorry. You are right. In fact, you \nare next, Senator Kerrey. Sorry about that."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n    Gentlemen, I also appreciate and congratulate you on your \ncourage in appearing before this committee. May I presume that \nthe committee did not ask you to comment on the legislation \nthat we passed a couple of weeks ago and sent on to the floor, \nthat you have not reviewed the legislation that Congress is \ntaking up? May I presume that is correct?\n    Mr. Moncrief. I have not reviewed it."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Well, one of the things I would like to do \nas just sort of a follow on is get you a copy of the bill. \nThere are changes in the law that we are proposing that I think \nwill address some of the problems that you have identified, \nalthough the larger problem we are dealing with here is a \nFourth Amendment right that all citizens have. This Congress, \nin its responsibilities governing Federal law, pass laws all \nthe time that grant all kinds of Federal agencies power, and \nyou are dealing with one of them.\n     All of us in our offices have citizens who have faced the \nIRS, the EPA, the USDA, the Health Care Financing \nAdministration, and on, and on, and on, not to mention the Drug \nEnforcement Agency, the FBI, and other agencies to whom we \ngrant substantial power, in some cases police power, to be able \nto collect and acquire evidence and bring a case. What we are \ndealing with here, is you all have had your Fourth Amendment \nrights violated.\n    One of the things I think we need to be sensitive to all \nthe time is that citizens have those Fourth Amendment rights \nand we have to be careful, in granting any agency of government \npower, that we do not give them so much power that they are \nable to do what you just experienced.\n    I think in our legislation we heard, in addition to \nindividual stories such as yours, lots of other stories; $4 \nbillion of taxpayer money wasted on computers, difficulty in \nmanaging, difficulty in recruiting, difficulty in retaining, \nall kinds of other problems; taxpayers not getting their calls \nanswered, all kinds of other things.\n    In our legislation we have three titles that I would ask \nyou to review, and I will get you a copy of the bill. I regret \nthat you were not given a copy of the bill prior to coming here \nbecause I think it would have been useful to get your comments \nin public as to whether or not, in particular, the new Taxpayer \nRights, a new right of action, for example, under negligence. \nIt may not be enough and we may need to look at it.\n    I was talking to Senator Bryan, who was a former \nprosecutor. We may need to look at the process of approaching a \ntaxpayer. How do you approach the taxpayer? We may need to look \nat an amendment, given your experience and other people's \nexperiences, that will change the process of approaching a \ntaxpayer to say we think that you have broken the law, we want \nto accumulate evidence, and so forth. I mean, there is a need \nto acquire evidence. Obviously, in all three of your cases they \nhave done it in the wrong way.\n    The question is, how do we change our law? So I would \nappreciate it very much if you would look at Title 3 of our \nlegislation, which extends substantial new powers to taxpayers \nand attempts to address this problem. I would appreciate very \nmuch your comment as to whether or not it does it.\n    Title 1 and Title 4 of the bill also attempts to deal with \nthe problem, because one of the things we discovered, and all \nof us who are members of Congress know this, we have a very \ndifficult time finding out what the IRS is doing.\n    They are not terribly accountable because the law grants \nthem not only authority, but the law says we want you to keep \nall this information private. We do not want taxpayer \ninformation to be made public.\n    So inside this wall of privacy, it is difficult for us to \nwork a case. It is difficult for us to help a citizen. I have \ngot cases that stretch all the way back to the 1980's that I am \nworking on on behalf of taxpayers, so it is difficult to \napproach it.\n    So we created a new public board that has substantial \npowers over the IRS to manage this agency and to work with \nCongress. We also found in Title 4 attempts to deal with this, \nand I would appreciate very much your honest comments on that, \nbut not today because you have not looked at the bill.\n    We also found that Congress has not done a very good job in \nits oversight. This is the first committee hearing meeting, \nsince the Chairman started last fall, in 17 years where we have \nhad full committee oversight of the IRS. There are six \ncommittees that the IRS reports to in Congress.\n    We proposed in our legislation to consolidate that \noversight at least twice a year so that this new public board \nwill have somebody they can come and talk to to make certain \nthat they get consistent instructions in the Congress as to \nwhat they are supposed to be doing.\n    Mr. Moncrief and the rest of you, I am sure, would \nappreciate what it would be like to run your business if you \nhad 535 people on your board of directors who were elected, and \nthat is basically what the IRS deals with.\n    So I just want to congratulate you and thank you for \nbringing this to this committee publicly, especially your \nsensitivity now to the dangers of granting any government \nagency powers as to the Fourth Amendment rights of a citizen, \nand I would appreciate very much, and I will get you a copy of \nthe legislation, any detailed comments that you would give us \non Title 1, Title 3, and Title 4, especially in the Title 3 \narea and the new rights that we grant to citizens.\n    My guess is from listening to your testimony that we may \nneed to look at some change in the law that would change the \nprocess of approaching a taxpayer when there is a suspicion \nthat maybe a violation of the law has occurred.\n    Mr. Gardner. Senator Kerrey."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Yes, sir.\n    Mr. Gardner. Could I ask you if, on this new tax bill, the \nappeals and the original auditing are going to be separated, or \nare they still being handled the same way that they have always \nbeen handled?"
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Well, first of all, the Taxpayer Advocate \nis made more independent than they were before. The Problem \nResolution Officer will no longer get their performance graded \nby somebody inside of the IRS, so they will be more \nindependent. We do change the due process of appeals. There is \na detailed section on that. Rather than responding to you \ndirectly, I think it would be best if I just gave you the \nlanguage.\n    Again, all three of you have experienced this thing and \nhave knowledge of it first-hand. I think your advice to us as \nto whether or not we have got the changes in the law right \nwould be very helpful.\n    I mean, you all know that the IRS is not a Sears and \nRoebuck. They are not a private sector agency, they are created \nby law. We write the law. We write the laws that tell the IRS \nwe want you to get more involved in drug investigations.\n    One of the reasons they are doing what they are doing is \nthat we have asked them to be more police-like in going out and \ngoing after individuals and trying to solve the problem of \ndrugs, money laundering, and so forth.\n    What has happened, it seems to me, is in the effort to do \nthat we have not given them, under the law, clear enough \ninstructions of how to do that. So we now need to change that \nlaw to make certain that they----"
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    And how not to do it."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    And how not to do it. That is quite right. \nSo anyway, I would be very grateful. The Majority Leader has \nindicated, that it is going to come to the floor next week and \nwe are likely to be debating this. We will go into conference \nrelatively quickly. I hope that you can help us make certain \nthat we get this law improved so that we do not have this kind \nof situation in the future. Mr. Moncrief, you are quite right. \nMost American people do not have the resources to fight.\n    I said yesterday, and I will tell you, the fear that you, \nMr. Gardner, mentioned in your testimony is so bad that former \nCommissioner Richardson, in her testimony to the Restructuring \nCommission, said that right after she came on the job she \nreceived her first paycheck in the mail with an IRS return \naddress, and she was too frightened to open it, and it was her \npaycheck. That just is perhaps the most extreme example.\n    The IRS, under this new law, we hope, will presume that \ntaxpayers are law-abiding citizens and will have an attitude \ntowards them that presumes they are law-abiding citizens. What \nwe are trying to do is get the penalties high enough that would \ndeter this kind of action, as well as establish new due \nprocesses for citizens when they are approached by the IRS.\n    Again, I thank you very much for your testimony.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Gardner, I would point out that we have \nmade some changes in the appeals approach. The present language \nforbids ex parte conversations between the agent and the \nappeals officer. There is a right to appeal to the Tax Court. \nBut it would be very helpful to have each and every one of you \ntake a careful look and give us the advantage of your advice.\n    It is now my pleasure to call on Senator Nickles.\n    Senator Nickles. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Some \npeople were questioning whether we should have this second \nround of hearings. I think yesterday's hearings, coupled with \ntoday, are certainly evidence that we need these hearings. I \nthink the Criminal Investigative Division is out of control, \nthe IRS is out of control.\n    Mr. Colaprete, how many agents busted your restaurant, your \nhome, and your staff member's home?\n    Mr. Colaprete. It was between 20 to 30 men in each \nestablishment.\n    Senator Nickles. Twenty to 30.\n    Mr. Colaprete. Four raids simultaneously, two homes, two \nrestaurants.\n    Senator Nickles. You have two restaurants in Virginia \nBeach.\n    Mr. Colaprete. I did have two restaurants. One, of course, \nwas closed six, 8 months later because I just could not keep it \ntogether. When you have a business that is out there in the \ncommunity like a restaurant, you do not recover from an armed \nintervention such as this. You just do not recover.\n    Senator Nickles. I understand.\n    Mr. Colaprete. This is 4 years later and we have not \nrecovered. We lost one restaurant, but at that time there were \ntwo restaurants. We had just opened the restaurant 4 months \nprior to the raids.\n    Senator Nickles. Mr. Gardner, how many people raided your \nIRS office?\n    Mr. Gardner. There were 15 IRS agents and approximately 5 \nU.S. Marshals.\n    Senator Nickles. Did they go into your home or just into \nyour office?\n    Mr. Gardner. In my tax service, sir.\n    Senator Nickles. Mr. Moncrief, how many did you say hit \nyour business?\n    Mr. Moncrief. There were 64. Absolutely. Sixty-four. They \nhad to get them from Waco, Dallas, and surrounding areas to \nhave that big a group.\n    Senator Nickles. Mr. Gardner, I do not remember you saying \nthat you had a disgruntled employee, but Mr. Colaprete and Mr. \nMoncrief evidently had former employees that had contacted IRS \nand said that there was a problem. In your case, Mr. Moncrief, \nevidently the former accountant even signed a contract where he \ncould make millions of dollars if there was significant \nrecovery, is that correct?\n    Mr. Moncrief. Yes, sir, he did. The bad part was, he used \nemployees of the IRS and the Department of Justice to get this \ncontract for his reward.\n    Senator Nickles. Mr. Moncrief, you mentioned that you \neventually settled. They were trying to get several hundred \nmillion dollars, you eventually settled for $23 million. It \nsounds to me like that was not the result of an audit that \nsaid, here are mistakes, you deducted things you should not \nhave deducted or you took a credit when it should have been a \ndeduction. It did not look to me like it was mistakes made on \nreturns, it sounds more like extortion.\n    Mr. Moncrief. This was an arbitrary sum that they came down \nto. They realized that they had done wrong and it was an \narbitrary sum that they came down to. But at that point, with \nthe harassment we had been through, it just made sense to me to \nget my family and myself back enjoying life.\n    Senator Nickles. You wanted to get it behind you and you \nwere willing to pay some amount to get rid of the harassment.\n    Mr. Moncrief. Yes, sir. And I am still after them.\n    Senator Nickles. I appreciate that. You also were forced to \nsign a waiver that you would not sue either the IRS or the \nagents that were involved in this case; is that correct?\n    Mr. Moncrief. That is correct.\n    Senator Nickles. Mr. Chairman, when we talk about \nlegislation we talk about taxpayers' rights, and we have this \nbill before the Senate next week. I think we should look at \nrepealing this added waiver that IRS gets in trying to complete \nthese cases and that they would not be sued.\n    When you find this type of abuse and then say, oh, but we \nwant to be held totally free from future liability, I am \nbothered by that and I am bothered by it a lot.\n    So I am thinking maybe we need to look at an additional \namendment when we come to the floor next week, and I will work \nwith the Chairman on it, as well as Senator Gramm from Texas \nwho also mentioned that maybe we need it, because that is \nwrong. That is absolutely wrong.\n    I can see from a business perspective where you would say, \nhey, I want to get this behind me and I am willing to pay \nsomething to get it out, because there is a lot of anxiety. Mr. \nColaprete, you mentioned it very well, and Mr. Gardner. This is \nan unbelievable strain, mental strain, financial strain. Mr. \nGardner, they tried to put you out of business.\n    Mr. Gardner. Yes, sir, they did.\n    Senator Nickles. But they were not successful.\n    Mr. Gardner. No. We opened the next morning and are still \nin business today.\n    Senator Nickles. Mr. Colaprete, the net result was, you \nlost one of your restaurants.\n    Mr. Colaprete. Yes, sir.\n    Senator Nickles. A lot of employees lost their job as a \nresult.\n    Mr. Colaprete. My restaurant generated lots and lots of \ndollars for my country in tax revenues. We lost that \ncapability. We turned lives upside down. I had 50, 60 employees \nin that one restaurant who lost their jobs.\n    Senator Nickles. Mr. Moncrief, in your case you mentioned, \nwhat, you only had like 30 some employees in your headquarters.\n    Mr. Moncrief. That is all.\n    Senator Nickles. But again, I can appreciate the anxiety \nbecause I used to be on your side of the fence, although I did \nnot have an IRS problem like this. But there is an enormous \namount of angst, anxiety and tension dealing with these \ndealings. I can imagine you might at some point be saying, yes, \nI will pay $23 million to get rid of it. I would be willing to \nget this thing behind me and try to get on with life.\n    Well, I hope, Mr. Chairman, that we will look at improving \nour bill even further. I think, as a result of every hearing \nand almost every witness, we have made improvements on this \nbill. It was a good reason, in my opinion, we did not take the \nHouse bill and pass it.\n    We have made significant improvements from the hearings \nthat we had in Oklahoma. We added about nine provisions as a \nresult of the witnesses there that I think strengthened the \nbill and will hopefully make IRS more accountable in the \nfuture. I think this panel has contributed to that and I \ncompliment them for it. Thank you.\n    The Chairman. Next, we have Senator Murkowski.\n    Senator Murkowski. Thank you very much. I am not going to \nadd much to what has already been said by my colleagues \nrelative to the indignantcy that I share as a U.S. Senator in \naccepting the responsibility for representing the people of \nthis country and the particular circumstances surrounding the \nIRS actions against the three of you. Such Gestapo-like actions \nare uncalled for.\n    To suggest that 64 agents would come into a business of 32 \npeople, it is really almost beyond belief. But it is factual \nand it does not occur just in the IRS, Mr. Chairman.\n    I had an occasion in my State where one of our two pulp \nmills, which is not in existence any more because of being shut \ndown by environmental opposition, and the case was parallel. It \ninvolved the Environmental Protection Agency, who for some time \nhad been investigating the mill, taking records out by the \ncarload, all engineering designs, and so forth, over an \nextended period of time instead of asking for specifics.\n    A short time later, they came in with some 30 U.S. \nMarshals, armed, and seized the offices, made a demand on \nmanagement to explain the effluent that had allegedly been \ngoing out of the mill.\n    When the mill personnel and engineers explained that the \ndrawings they had taken were from a small sawmill located on a \nsmall island in the native community of Metlekatla, they \nrecognized in examining this information they clearly had no \nknowledge of the engineering aspects of a pulp mill. There was \nno emissions flowing from the pulp mill into the bay, but it \nwas another mill for which the pulp mill managed to have the \nengineering plans.\n    They accumulated this Gestapo-like effort because they were \nabsolutely unfamiliar with the technical aspects of what they \nwere dealing with and had been responding to this case simply \nby a whistle blower who had alleged that they were putting out \neffluent.\n    I think it brings it to the point that I want to make, Mr. \nChairman. I think we should look a little bit beyond just the \ntactics of the IRS, but other Federal agencies that clearly are \nusing a presence to threaten and harass citizens of this \ncountry, whether they be taxpayers or others doing business. \nObviously we have to maintain enforcement and compliance with \nFederal law, but these tactics are absolutely uncalled for.\n    We can send people in to investigate, but you do not have \nto send armed personnel in flak jackets, and that is what \noccurred in my State and I am very much opposed to it, Mr. \nChairman.\n    So I would encourage, as we reflect on this, that other \nFederal agencies that have enforcement responsibility had \nbetter temper their procedure a little bit and recognize we are \ndealing with U.S. citizens here who, for the most part, are \nhonorably engaged in their daily activities.\n    And if there is cause for action and investigation, it \nshould be done in an appropriate manner befitting of the trust \nthat we put in these agencies to enforce actions, and the \nsuggestion that Gestapo-tactics men in uniformed flak jackets, \narmed, is simply inappropriate and unnecessary in 99 percent of \nthese cases.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to commend you witnesses \nfor coming forth with your stories.\n    The Chairman. Senator Conrad?"
"conrad","Senator Conrad","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank the \nwitnesses as well.\n    First of all, I am a former tax administrator elected by \nthe people of my State to serve in that position. I cannot \nconceive of a circumstance that would justify the treatment \neach of you have endured. It is absolutely outrageous.\n    Mr. Colaprete, I have read your testimony. I was not able \nto be here when you started, but I have read it. It is \nunspeakable, the way you were treated, and your partner, and \nyour employees. Frankly, it tells me that there is a revenue \nservice run amok to be treating taxpayers in that way. It is \nabsolutely and totally unacceptable.\n    I, for one, would apologize to you. That should never have \nhappened. Even if they had somebody making these assertions, \nthey had an affirmative obligation to establish that there was \ncause, and even then the way they approached you and your \nbusiness was absolutely outrageous. How anybody in a position \nof responsibility would authorize raids of this nature is \nbeyond my understanding. The people who did authorize such \nactions should be held to account themselves.\n    Mr. Gardner, it is also in your case I find totally \nunacceptable the way you were approached. What conceivable \njustification could there be for approaching you in the way you \nwere approached? I mean, this is people who have gotten a \nlittle bit of authority and have let it go to their heads. What \nis in their minds to treat a taxpayer the way you were treated?\n    And I do not care what evidence they had. You do not \napproach anybody in the way you were approached. That is just \nwrong. And anybody that does not have the judgment to \nunderstand that ought to be fired. That is just the way it is. \nThey ought to be removed from service because they have no \nunderstanding, they have no basic judgment.\n    Mr. Moncrief, this raid on your business, 64 agents, \nwhatever it was, that is preposterous. What are they thinking \nof? I must say, it sounds like police-state tactics.\n    I do not care if they thought you owed $100 million, they \nhave no justification for this kind of heavy-handed assault on \nany American. That is wrong and we have got to say it clearly \nand distinctly. That is wrong, it is unacceptable, it cannot be \nrepeated. And the people that engage in that kind of conduct \nought to be held accountable and they ought to be fired and \nthey ought to be punished.\n    That ought to be the message that goes forth from here. And \nI do not care if you owed $100 million, nobody and their \nemployees deserve to be treated that way in America. So that \nneeds to be the message that is loud and clear here.\n    Mr. Gardner, do you have any idea what led to this raid on \nyour business? This IRS agent indicated to somebody that came \nand talked to some of your employees, as I recall your \ntestimony, said he had a vendetta against you. For what reason? \nDo you have any idea why he would have had a vendetta against \nyou?\n    Mr. Gardner. Other than being a tax preparer and helping \nclients reduce their taxes legally, I have no idea. I had never \nmet the fellow before he came in my office. They did send an \nundercover agent in wired back in May of 1991 to tape record \nme, for whatever reason, we found out. But that was 4 years \nbefore they raided. I just really have no idea, sir. That is \njust the IRS today."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    To your knowledge, have the tax returns \nthat you have prepared understated your client's income?\n    Mr. Gardner. No, sir. I do 5,000, 6,000 returns a year and \nI have about maybe 6 to 8 audits a year. It is just normal, \neveryday auditing. It is usually less than the percentage by \nabout half, but I really do not know, sir. Just because I was a \nlarge tax service and they just wanted to make an example out \nof me."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Well, that is totally outrageous. I mean, \nthat is not the way one operates. As a tax administrator, it is \nimportant to enforce the law. There is no question that there \nare people who understate what they owe, but that is totally \nunacceptable to be treating people in that way.\n    Mr. Moncrief, you indicated you did pay $23 million. Have \nyou paid that amount of money over to the IRS?\n    Mr. Moncrief. Yes, sir, I paid that. But that was not for \ntaxes, it was just what they called a settlement. I never got \nany tax notice before September 1, 1994, nor have I seen \nsomething saying I was in arrears or had done something wrong. \nI had not received one before that or since then."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    How many years were involved in this \nsettlement?\n    Mr. Moncrief. This went back to about 10 or 12 years ago."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Ten or 12. Is this for a 10- or 12-year \nperiod?\n    Mr. Moncrief. More than that. It went back to about 1979 or \n1980, right in there. From 1984."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    So this would be like a 16-year period in \nwhich they assert that you owed this additional tax. Do you \nhave any idea what your effective tax rate has been during that \nperiod?\n    Mr. Moncrief. Well, it is up in the top. But they did not \nsay this was a tax, they just said this was an arbitrary amount \nthat they wanted. It came down from $300 million to $200 \nmillion, to $100 million."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    You believe that you do not owe any \nadditional tax?\n    Mr. Moncrief. I never have looked at it or found any that \nappears we owe. They never said that we owed it."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Well, Mr. Chairman, I think one thing we \nshould do is ask the Revenue Service to revisit this issue and \nto determine whether or not Mr. Moncrief owes any additional \nmoney or not. If he does not, he ought to receive a refund. We \nought to ask the Revenue Service to review this case where this \nman asserts he does not owe the money. He certainly should not \nhave had to pay the money.\n    I thank the Chairman.\n    The Chairman. I would say to the distinguished Senator, we \nhave had problems with settlements before where we have tried \nto get the agency to take a second look. We thought there were \nvery serious problems with it. But so far, I have had no \nsuccess in that regard.\n    We have got three additional Senators to raise questions, \nand we, of course, have two more panels. But the order will be \nSenator Grassley, Senator Mack, and Senator Lott. I will \nrecognize the Majority Leader if he has to leave."
"lott","Senator Lott","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will wait.\n    The Chairman. Senator Grassley.\n    Senator Grassley. First of all, I think I need to \ncompliment Senator Conrad on his very strong statement about \nthe need for this sort of discipline, and in fact, people that \nact like this not even to be in government service.\n    But let me follow on where he left off. To each of you, \nwere any of the agents that you have discussed who committed \nthese horrible acts against you disciplined, that you know of?\n    Mr. Gardner. No, sir. Not in my case.\n    Mr. Colaprete. Not that I know of.\n    Mr. Moncrief. No, sir.\n    Senator Grassley. Well, then even emphasizes more than ever \nthe point that Senator Conrad was making because this is where \nthe problem is then. We have this abuse of power, we have abuse \nof your constitutional rights, and nobody is held accountable. \nWe talk about the agents should, but there is a system here \nthat ought to be examined.\n    The IRS itself has to assume responsibility, it seems, to \nmake sure that people's constitutional rights are protected. \nAnd when somebody abuses those, if the people in management at \nIRS are not going to discipline people like this, we are just \ngoing to encourage more of it.\n    These stories that you have told us, they are awful \nstories, they are appalling stories. To the average citizen \nwatching on television, these are earth-shattering things that \nIRS agents could, and would, heartlessly wreak havoc on \npeople's lives. It is amazing that anyone would be so \ndestructive, feel so strong about something, that they would \ntreat you folks the way that you have been treated.\n    I am used to discussing things like we are discussing here \nin the Finance Committee as a member of the Judiciary Committee \nwhere we discuss criminals and prison terms, we discuss what to \ndo with heartless criminals who intentionally destroy other \npeople's lives. That is what we have right here with IRS agents \nwho have done things that are criminal.\n    So it is kind of amazing to me that the IRS system, that is \npart of our government, a government that is supposed to be \nunder the rule of law, a government where employees are \nsupposed to be held responsible. It does not hold people \nresponsible for their actions.\n    This is the point that I want to emphasize that Senator \nConrad made very clear about agents being punished for what \nthey are doing wrong, but there is something wrong that we have \ngot a system that does not want to hold these people \naccountable because these are destructive actions.\n    But it is equally awful that no one is held accountable. If \nagents were held accountable, if they were disciplined for \ntheir wrongdoing, it would serve as a deterrent, it seems to \nme, that would keep other agents from abusing taxpayers, if \nthese agents were used as high-profile examples.\n    It is still not too late. If some of these people are \nemployed, it is still not too late to hold them as high-profile \nexamples as they attempt to use prominent taxpayers, and then \nmaybe we would not have any more of this and they would know \nhow it feels themselves how they treated you. It is a crime \nitself that IRS agents get away with these sort of crimes.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Grassley.\n    Senator Mack is next.\n    Senator Mack. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, I commend you \nfor holding these hearings. There has been some indications in \nthe past that we held these hearings last year, we do not need \nto hold any more, we ought to get on with passing the \nlegislation.\n    But as Senator Kerrey raised in his questions, which is \nexactly the first point that I put down, which was going to be \nto ask you whether you had read the legislation that we had \nproposed and do you think it addresses the problems that you \nhave experienced. I understand from your response that you have \nnot.\n    I will tell you, Mr. Chairman, I am troubled that we have \nfrankly not covered all the areas that need to be covered in \nthis legislation. I am going to consider whether I should \nappeal to the Majority Leader to delay this until we have an \nopportunity to really have folks who have experienced these \nproblems, have had an opportunity, I would assume with their \nattorneys, to take a look at this legislation and see, in fact, \nwhether we have gone far enough. I see I have just excited my \ncolleague from the other side."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","lott","Senator Lott","    Well, Mr. Chairman, if we are going to do \nthat, let us ask the witnesses to come before the committee to \ncomment on the legislation.\n    Senator Mack. Good idea."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Thank you.\n    Senator Mack. I will do such right now. One of the areas \nwhere I have a problem, and which is not a secret to any of \nyou, were the amendments that were passed at mark-up to add two \nmembers to the commission.\n    Now, this Oversight Commission is supposedly to help see \nthat the experiences that you have gone through do not happen \nagain. But we ended up adding to this private sector taxpayer, \nif you will, board to oversee the IRS two individuals, one to \nbe a representative of the IRS employees, and the other being \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, who did not want this \nlegislation in the first place.\n    Now, mind you, these individuals who are going to be on \nthis board are part-time. If you have these other two entities \nadded to this board who have huge staffs to supply them with \nall kinds of information and a point of view, my concern is we \nhave destroyed the credibility of this oversight board. I would \nbe interested in your sense about that as well. Would any of \nyou like to respond?\n    Mr. Moncrief. Well, I cannot respond to that now, but I can \ncertainly discuss it with my attorneys and get back with you. \nBut what you said makes all the sense in the world.\n    Mr. Gardner. I would like to discuss it with my attorney, \ntoo, Thomas Seymour, give you our opinions on it. (See p. 268 \nfor Mr. Moncrief's response to Senators Mack and Kerrey.)\n    Mr. Colaprete. The same with me, sir.\n    Senator Mack. All right. Again, we have all used language \nhere today that I think comes from our hearts. I was trying to \nthink how I was feeling. How do you put into words the feelings \nthat go through our hearts and minds here this morning? A \ncouple of them were, stunned by what you had to say, chilled \nwas another one. Chilled by what you told us this morning. \nAngry about what you had to tell us. Troubled. Troubled.\n    Again, my intentions are not to delay this any longer. But, \nas you have said, Senator Kerrey, over and over again, we write \nthe laws. I just want to make sure we go far enough in \naddressing these issues. I have great concern with the police \npowers that are used by the IRS that seem to be way beyond \nanything that they should have, given what they have done with \nthem.\n    I think one of the messages from the hearing this morning \nthat all of should take to heart, in our zeal to go after \ncriminals, we need to make sure we write in the proper \nsafeguards to make sure that honest, taxpaying citizens do not \nhave those tools used against them.\n    For the first time I saw this morning this informant reward \nagreement. It says, ``Whereas, the Commissioner of the IRS is \nauthorized, pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 7623 and \nTreasury Department Order Number 150-10, to approve payments \nfor information.''\n    I suspect that when that was done it was, again, done for \nthe purpose of getting to drug traffickers, Mafia. But we see \nthree individuals before us this morning where these tools have \nbeen used against them. I mean, 10 percent of the first $10 \nmillion, 15 percent of the next $10 million, 20 percent of the \nnext $10 million. I think we have got a perverse system and I \nam not sure we have gone far enough.\n    So, I really do appreciate your being here this morning. I \nthink you have really focused the country, once again, even \nthough many of us thought that could not be done again after \nthe hearings last September. I think you have clearly focused \nus again.\n    Mr. Moncrief, in your opening statement you said, ``In my \nimagination, Federal raids were always confined to Mafia bosses \nand drug lords. If you had told me that 64 IRS agents would \nstorm my office with sidearms holstered and boot heels \ntrampling my civil rights and my business reputation, I would \nnot have believed it.''\n    You know what? I think for too long many of us have heard \nthose stories and there has been a tendency to say, not in \nAmerica. Not in a free country. These kinds of tactics cannot \nbe used against honest individuals.\n    Well, I think that your testimony this morning has \nindicated that, in fact, they have, and we have got to make \nsure that it does not happen again.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Mack.\n    Just let me make a couple of observations. The question of \noversight is a continuing matter. One oversight hearing, two, \nor a dozen are not going to finish the matter because we are \ngoing to continue to have problems in the future that need to \nbe exposed and corrected.\n    Now, some wanted me to move ahead early on the House bill \nand I felt that was not the appropriate time because I thought \nthere was much more that needed to be immediately done. But \nthere never is an ideal time. I think it is important that we \ndo move. We have a number of proposals in the legislation that \nwe have worked out with the new Commissioner, in whom I have \nthe greatest confidence. I want to ensure that he has the tools \nand opportunity to do what is necessary.\n    So I feel very strongly that the time has come that, in the \nimmediate future--and I do not say it has to be any particular \nday, or so forth--it is important that we get on with the job.\n    At this time I would like to call on our distinguished \nMajority Leader, Senator Lott."
"lott","Senator Lott","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am going to be \nbrief because I know you have other witnesses. If the rest of \nthem have stories to tell anything close to this, we need to \nhear it.\n    I have heard over the years the conduct and actions \nsometimes of the IRS described as Gestapo-type actions, but I \nnever had heard examples as explicit as this of exactly that \nkind of conduct, and it is totally unacceptable in America.\n    I have had people ask me, well, why have you not done more \nabout it in Congress? Why have you not had more oversight \nhearings, why have you not had legislation before now? I have \nthought a lot about that and I have talked to some members of \nthe House and Senate. I really think there is a certain degree \nof intimidation that is applied to the Congress itself. I know \nof some examples where Congressmen and Senators, as a matter of \nfact, felt this sting repeatedly if they got too aggressive.\n    So to these people, on behalf of the American people, I \napologize for allowing a situation to develop in the law that \nwould lead to this kind of conduct.\n    Now, having said that, while I think that the legislation \nwe have developed is a significant improvement, I still would \nlike to make some changes and we are learning as we go along. I \nthink what we have had described here today clearly is illegal. \nThis kind of conduct should not have been allowed. Somebody \nshould have taken action to stop this and it should not have \nneeded these hearings or an additional set of laws to \naccomplish that.\n    But I will just get to the real question here. Mr. \nColaprete, in your testimony you name the IRS special agent who \ntried to destroy your business, a Ms. Carol Willman. Now, this \nquestion is being asked, I guess, in general, but I want to ask \nyou specifically. Do you know if Ms. Willman is still employed \nby the IRS, if she was ever punished for what she did to you? \nThat is my first question.\n    Mr. Colaprete. No, sir. I have no idea."
"lott","Senator Lott","lott","Senator Lott","    You do not know what her situation is.\n    Mr. Colaprete. I have no idea. I do not have the luxury of \nspeaking with people like Carol Willman."
"lott","Senator Lott","lott","Senator Lott","    You do not know whether she was punished or \nallowed to continue working at IRS.\n    Mr. Colaprete. No, sir. No, sir."

"lott","Senator Lott","lott","Senator Lott","    Mr. Moncrief, the same question to you. You \ndescribed this instance that you had to deal with. Do you know \nif, for instance, the IRS District Director in Dallas was \ninvestigated, punished, or fired for placing a bounty on you \nand your business?\n    Mr. Moncrief. No, sir. No one has been fired that I know \nof."
"lott","Senator Lott","lott","Senator Lott","    You do not know of any disciplinary action \nthat was taken.\n    Mr. Moncrief. I know of no disciplinary action.

"lott","Senator Lott","lott","Senator Lott","    I wish you well.\n    Mr. Chairman, yesterday, in answer to a question from one \nof the witnesses, she identified the Office of the Deputy \nCommissioner, Mr. Dolan, as the place where these cases had \ndied, either through slow treatment, neglect, or whatever.\n    But I think we need to go a step further. Who is the person \nthat is responsible for making sure that people that act like \nthis are punished, is it the Deputy Commissioner or is it the \nCommissioner?\n    Somebody should have acted on these cases and I think we \nneed to find out the answer to that. It is not just a question \nof passing new laws, it is a question of finding out why \nexisting laws have not been enforced.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. There is no question but that is a problem of \nthis agency's, not only a question of changing the process, but \nit is a question of assuring that there is strong, capable \nmanagement that will, on a consistent basis, apply the law as \nwritten by the Congress. I think this is a serious problem of \nmanagement. That is the reason I think it is so important that \nthe new Commissioner be an individual experienced in management \nmatters."

"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Might I make just a quick observation?\n    The Chairman. Yes, sir."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    One of the things that strikes me is the \nculture that has developed here. Senator Kerrey was mentioning \nto me earlier that he thinks that perhaps some of this flows \nfrom what we have done to try to go after drug kingpins.\n    I think, unfortunately, we may have a situation where \npeople have kind of gotten mixed up here. We have authorized \ntough legislation to use the IRS to help other law enforcement \ngo after criminal figures, whether it is organized crime or \ndrug kingpins, and that is as it should be.\n    But we have got to make sure there is a bright line out \nthere so that kind of police action is not visited against \ntaxpayers. I do not care if those taxpayers owe money. \nObviously we have got to enforce the laws and we have got to \nmake sure people pay what they owe. But we should not permit or \nallow these agencies to engage in police-state tactics against \naverage taxpayers. I think that has got to be a focus of part \nof our concern here.\n    The Chairman. It is my concern with that matter that caused \nme to say in my opening statement that I think it is critically \nimportant that William Webster, as part of his study, look at \nthis question of CID and whether it is appropriate for them to \nbe involved in money laundering and drugs, and so forth.\n    I think the most impressive thing that we heard yesterday \nby one of the witnesses, or one of the most impressive things, \nwas the fact that, today, we see intrusive investigations of \nthe type you gentlemen described today. That was not the case, \naccording to this witness, of 15 years ago when they were \nsuccessful as they are today in assuring that the taxpayer was \npaying what he or she owed the government.\n    Well, gentlemen, time is moving on. I cannot tell you again \nhow much I appreciate your courage, the fact that you are here \ntoday. Your story is an appalling one. This is America and no \nAmerican should have to go through the kind of suffering that \nyou and your families have endured. I want to express my \nappreciation for your being here today. Thank you very much."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Mr. Chairman, I did not hear your opening \nstatement, I just heard a statement about it. We have enacted \nlaws in this Congress that have granted law enforcement \nagencies substantial authority to erode Fourth Amendment rights \nin the effort to fight a war on drugs and other sorts of \nthings.\n    Do we intend to ask Mr. Webster whether any of these laws \nthat weaken Fourth Amendment rights have had not only an \nunanticipated impact upon these three gentlemen here, but \nperhaps other citizens?"

break,break,break,break
"","","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Mr. Warren. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the Senate \nFinance Committee for granting NAACP and my request for this \nopportunity to testify before this distinguished body on the \nsevere problems of racial discrimination and abuse of power and \nmismanagement of the Internal Revenue Service by its leaders.\n    Since August 1997, I have served as chairman of the NAACP \nTask Force on Federal Sector Employment Discrimination. This \ntask force convened a Summit on Federal Sector Employment \nDiscrimination on January 17, 1998 at the University of \nMaryland, College Park.\n    This summit was sponsored by black employees of seven \nFederal agencies and seven NAACP units in Maryland and Northern \nVirginia. The seven Federal agencies were the Department of \nDefense, Commerce, Agriculture, Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation, Interior, U.S. Information Agency, Voice of \nAmerica, and the Internal Revenue Service. Approximately 350 \npeople from 9 States were in attendance.\n    Approximately 30 employees from the IRS were in attendance \nand presented testimony at this summit. The summit has received \na number of verbal complaints and affidavits on IRS employees, \nsome of whom are whites, Hispanics, and Asians, including \nblacks also.\n    The strongest complaints were received from Milwaukee, \nWisconsin, Houston, Texas, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and \nWashington, DC. Based on the data received, the NAACP believes \nthat most of the complaints and allegations are of substantial \nmerit and validity.\n    IRS abuses and allegations received by the NAACP are \nbasically the following summary listing: (1)Allegations of \nracial and sexual discrimination in promotions are a severe and \nincreasing problem; (2) Allegations of management's refusal to \ndeal positively and fairly with valid complaints are common; \n(3) Retaliation, loss of promotional advancements, and \nmistreatment are by-products faced by most individuals filing \nan EEO complaint, regardless of race and/or sex; (4) In many \ninstances, some long-term career black employees are compelled \nto train whites, who become their supervisor within a \nrelatively short time frame; and (5) Many blacks, especially \nthose at the GS-13 and above level, claim that they are \nfrequently the recipients of lower than deserved performance \nratings which negatively impact their pursuit of upward \nmobility opportunities.\n    Racism and sexism across the board is wrong and illegal. \nThere are a number of white NAACP members and millions of white \nsupporters across America. The NAACP has received a number of \ncomplaints that some blacks and other racial minorities \nemployed by the IRS are guilty of committing discrimination \nagainst their co-workers and subordinates.\n    NAACP believes with the theory of the late Associate U.S. \nSupreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall that racism practiced \nby any person and/or entity is wrong and has no place in \nAmerica.\n    The IRS needs a housecleaning of its top management, \nincluding some blacks who have basically zero commitment to \ndoing the right thing.\n    Promoting marginal or unqualified individuals occurs \nfrequently. IRS management has frequently promoted marginally \nqualified or possibly unqualified individuals, including a few \nblacks, to high-level positions as a reward for supporting \nracism, racist policies, and/or whatever management does.\n    The personal benefits for many IRS managers who frequently \npromote marginally qualified or unqualified individuals are \nemployees who display a personal and institutional loyalty as a \nresult of their promotions by accepting and backing up the \nactions of their managers.\n    In addition, the issue of competitive promotion is \nbasically a joke because many, or possibly a majority, of the \nhigh-level GS/GM-12 and above jobs involve pre-selection prior \nto being posted.\n    A case in point involves a black GS-15 male who acted in an \nSES job for a period of time. The selection panel recommended a \nwhite male for the job. During early September 1997, the Office \nof Personnel Management, under pressure from IRS, refused to \ncertify this unqualified white male for a senior SES position. \nThe GS-15 black male has not received any justice at IRS.\n    Some of the major cost of promoting marginally qualified or \nunqualified employees are as follows: (1) The taxpayers are \npaying for incompetence, while at the same time some IRS \nemployees are simultaneously violating Federal EEO laws; (2) \nThe quality and skill level that the agency workforce is \nsubpar, with low productivity and low morale being the bottom \nline result of such questionable actions; (3) The Balkanization \nof the workplace is one of the very serious results of the \nhiring and promoting of marginally qualified or unqualified \nemployees, especially in high-level jobs which require \nsubstantial skill, formal training, and education; and (4) Many \nblacks with substantial education and skills are hired into the \nIRS at the GS-5 and/or GS-7 levels and retire, in many \ninstances, with only one promotion over a 20- to 40-year \ncareer.\n    It is obvious to the task force, and me, that IRS will \nissue a substantial percentage of its highest performance \nratings to blacks who occupy lower level positions or to blacks \nwho, under basically any standards, are not qualified by \neducation, experience, training, or personal ability to hold \nmiddle management positions.\n    This tactic and strategy allows IRS management to give many \nof its highly qualified, highly educated, and highly skilled \nand overall best qualified blacks unjustified lower performance \nratings, with little to no change of being overturned because \nthe percentage of blacks with the highest ratings are within an \nacceptable tolerance range. This IRS strategy has negatively \nimpacted many highly skilled and highly educated blacks.\n    A workplace free of religious, ethnic, and racial bigotry \nis an American dream which we all look forward to, but much of \nIRS's higher management has other ideas, namely to keep \nthemselves in power.\n    Milwaukee, Wisconsin IRS Office, a Case Study in Abuse. The \nMilwaukee NAACP president has asked the National NAACP and me \nas National NAACP's Criminal Justice Committee chairman to \nassist in its efforts to get IRS to deal with some very \nsignificant racial and sexual problems at the Milwaukee office \nand smaller offices in Wisconsin.\n    The U.S. Senators from Wisconsin and some members of the \nWisconsin Congressional delegation have shown substantial \ndignity, courage, and decency in their pursuit of justice and \nequality for the IRS employees in Wisconsin.\n    The following is a listing and synopsis of some of the \nmajor concerns and allegations received by the NAACP in \nMilwaukee and forwarded to me for assistance.\n    Case one. A white female GS-13 Criminal Investigation \nDivision Special Agent has been placed on administrative leave \nsince August or September of 1997. She has faced numerous \nactions which are pure and simple retaliation from IRS \nofficials in Wisconsin for telling the truth. According to the \ninformation provided to the NAACP, she had an upward and \nrewarding career until January of 1996.\n    In or around January of 1996, she compiled a truthful \naffidavit for use in an EEO case involving another person which \nwas the right thing to do, but it has created significant \npersonal suffering for her.\n    She has been subjected to repeated medical testing and \ndiagnosis. As recently as today, she is now in Washington, DC \nbeing subject to psychological training under the guise of \nfitness for duty.\n    She filed an EEO complaint which alleged that, in an \nattempt to scare her, an IRS agent drove recklessly towards her \nin a government vehicle. As far as NAACP could determine, the \nspecial agent driving the vehicle has not been disciplined. The \nemployee has suffered too much for basically no justifiable \nreasons, and she urgently needs your individual and collective \nhelp.\n    Case two. A black female GS-6 secretary has provided the \nNAACP with the following bizarre story which our investigation \nhas found to be truthful. She has endured racial and sexual \ndiscrimination since 1988. She quietly endured until recently \nfiling her first EEO complaint in 1994.\n    The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, EEOC, \nfound that the charges were valid. The retaliation, verbal \nabuse, and harassment has escalated since that time as a result \nof filing this and nine complaints later.\n    Some of the documented abuses of racism and IRS abuse of \nauthority are as follows: One: She won the first case when it \nwent before the EEOC, but this winning has negatively impacted \nher career and her physical well-being.\n    Two: She has been discriminated against, subject to verbal \nabuse in front of her co-workers, her managers, and fellow \nemployees, and harassed almost daily in a very hostile work \nenvironment with the goal of ostracizing her.\n    Three: In one very sordid incident, her manager threw \npictures and a newspaper at her in front of her co-workers. He \nwas allowed to retire without sanctions and with his dignity \nintact.\n    Four: In another incident, the same manager referred to her \nas a ``Black Bitch'' in front her co-workers.\n    Five: Management has referred to and spread the word among \nemployees that she and other IRS employees who believe in \nequality and justice are unstable and a potential deadly threat \nto their co-workers.\n    Six: Her performance evaluation was deliberately rated low \nin order to deny her competitive upward mobility opportunities. \nThis happens too often to individuals who are not favorites of \nIRS management.\n    Seven: As a final act of management to strategize her \nplanned removal, a black female was assigned as her acting \nmanager for approximately 6 months to replace the previous \nmanager who had recently retired. The job was posted, she \napplied for it, but she was not selected and it was given to a \nwhite male. The acting manager filed an EEO complaint and she \neventually negotiated a transfer to a western State.\n    After filing her complaint, the black female acting manager \ntold the secretary she found no reason to give her a low \nperformance rating, and the refusal to do so was a factor in \nher failure to get the job on a permanent basis.\n    Case three. A black female who was objecting to a black \nmale and Hispanic female showing their love in the workplace \nreported the affair to IRS management. She was the recipient--\nwhether intended or not is unknown to the NAACP--of filthy, \ngross, and vile sexual correspondence between the couple.\n    On April 9, 1998, 20 days ago, the black male lost his \ncomposure, yelled incoherently eyeball to eyeball at the \nterrified black female. A National Treasury Employee Union \nofficial aided her in her escape from the angry black male.\n    The issue is before the Wisconsin courts for relief. The \nvictim is requesting a temporary restraining order. IRS, to the \nbest of NAACP's knowledge, has done virtually nothing to ensure \nthe safety of this employee who does not want to be the \nrecipient of filthy sexual material at work.\n    Case four. A Hispanic female, GS-12, Internal Revenue Agent \nobjected to being unfairly evaluated as a low dollar per hour \nproducer, which is supposedly against IRS policy.\n    She is under severe pressure from IRS for her belief that \nan outside vendor prepared Climate Assessment Report which \ndealt with the hostile work environment in Milwaukee should be \nreleased.\n    IRS does not want to release the report because of its \nnegative findings. The possible loss of her job is a deep \nconcern. It is our hope that there will be an investigation \ninto these serious and substantiated allegations.\n    Mr. Chairman and committee members, all of us are Americans \nand we do not want quotas and/or favored treatment. We are \nseeking a chance to fulfill the dream eloquently voiced by Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr. many years ago.\n    Congress must take an active role in cleaning up the mess \nat IRS, especially employment discrimination. Correspondence to \nformer IRS Commissioner Richardson were met with exception to \nall claims of racism within the IRS.\n    The response is typical of the IRS and illustrates that \nthis agency often blindly denies serious allegations of \nwrongdoing without a thorough examination into the facts.\n    It is highly probable that the failure to institute \nsignificant senior management changes will be an exercise in \nfutility. A new IRS Commissioner, surrounded by senior level \ncareer employees who caused the problem, will not solve IRS's \ninternal problems. IRS senior management, legal staff, and EEO \nstaff are major contributors to the internal problems within \nIRS.\n    In closing, I want to thank the Chairman and the committee \nfor allowing me to speak on this serious national problem.\n    The Chairman. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Warren.\n    On the first page of your testimony you state that, ``IRS \nmanagement has frequently promoted marginally qualified or \npossibly unqualified individuals, including a few blacks, to \nhigher level jobs or positions as a reward for supporting \nracism, racist policies, and/or whatever management does.''\n    Now, you are clearly saying that racism is a major problem \nat the IRS. But are you also saying that racism is part of the \nway the agency manages its employees?\n    Mr. Warren. Racism and the reward for willing to be part of \na racist organization is one of the prime requirements for many \nIRS managers to accept a black person. Not on qualifications, \nbut they want you to be there to do whatever they want you to \ndo, when they are wrong, to do wrong.\n    We hear black people talking about blacks who know they are \nnot qualified for jobs but are recipients of jobs because that \nway they do not have to promote the best qualified blacks, the \nbest educated blacks.\n    An example of what you were talking about when you hear \nthese things, is a black man in his mid- to late-50's would say \nhe never experienced discrimination in his life and he is at a \nhigh level position. So that tells you something about the \nworld we live in, the IRS world.\n    The other thing about that is, I think the problem is they \nhave had so much--I do not work there, I am at the national \nNAACP. I do not work there, but what has happened, the EEO \noffice there has evidently been staffed over the years by \npeople who are marginally qualified, who have problems and \ncharges against them.\n    They are selecting people to run the EEO office that should \nnot be selected to run any EEO office, not to mention a \nnational EEO office. There is no punishment and no penalties \nfor doing wrong, so racism is the reward.\n    The Chairman. Let me make sure I understand what you are \nsaying, Mr. Warren. You are saying that the agency purposely \ngives high performance ratings to black employees in lower \npositions so that it can give lower performance ratings to \nblack employees in higher level positions, but little or no \nchance of these low ratings being overturned; is that correct? \nHow does this work?\n    Mr. Warren. Well, how it works, it is like the gentlemen \nwho were here before. If you do not have millions of dollars \nand you have got the Justice Department attorneys down there, \nyou cannot hardly prove an EEO case today unless you have \n$100,000. How many people in this room have $100,000 to fight \nan EEO case?\n    So if you get the person down at the bottom and you give \nthem this high rating and with the best qualified blacks filing \na complaint, you are going to take affidavits from the whole \nroom.\n    What you are going to find in the room, is the blacks with \nthe lower grade are going to be satisfied and scared to lose \nwhat they have got, and the guy who is the best qualified black \nwith education and training is angry, he is hostile, or she is \nupset and hurt, pained, because some of them want to be \naccepted so bad that, when they do file a complaint, their \ncareers at that point are over with.\n    So what has happened there is, the people at the bottom are \nvery happy to get those high ratings, knowing they are not \ngoing to go anyplace higher than the middle or upper levels, \nand the people at the higher levels are given the lower ratings \nbecause they know the agency is going to sustain their \ncomplaint.\n    When they file a complaint against the agency, the agency \nis going to sustain based on the numerical numbers. It is very \ndifficult to sustain an EEO case when you are fighting an \nagency with unlimited resources and when they are buying off \nsome of the blacks.\n    One of the things you have is a situation today in the IRS, \nand other agencies too, we find, is a lot of the blacks who are \nbeing promoted are nothing but mercenaries available for the \nhighest bidder.\n    The Chairman. Let me go to a statement you make at the end \nin respect to senior management changes at the IRS. You go on \nto say that, ``A new IRS Commissioner, surrounded by senior \nlevel career employees who caused the problem, will not solve \nIRS internal problems. IRS senior management, legal staff, and \nEEO are major contributors to the problems within the IRS.''\n    Is it your opinion then that the Commissioner should clean \nhouse at the highest levels?\n    Mr. Warren. He should clean house based on the information \nthat the NAACP has received. Let me just say, I have a notebook \nhere from Milwaukee, and I have another two-inch notebook at my \nhouse that I did not bring with me that basically deals with \nMilwaukee. We could go to Houston. We have files on Houston. We \nhave got files on other cities.\n    Let me just say, the information to the Deputy Commissioner \nof the IRS as a career employee, I think, has been there for a \nwhile. I think the first thing you should do is think about \nremoving them and put new leadership in that office, new \nleadership in the management administration office, and new \nleadership in the EEO office because I do not think the EEO \noffice now, and in the future, is going to do the right thing.\n    We have people out in the field in these various regional \noffices that our NAACP members, black and white--and some of \nthe whites are not members. We deal with anybody. If you want \nto comment, if you have legitimate complaints, we will hear \nyou.\n    The concern we have there is, if you clean house you might \nget something done. The new Commissioner might be an \noutstanding individual, but if you go into a cage and you are \nsurrounded by snakes, cobras, eventually one of those cobras is \ngoing to bite you and it is going to be fatal to what you are \ntrying to do.\n    I think that is where he has himself today. He needs to get \nsome new people there. He needs to be given some authority to \nselect some new people that he can have trust in that is going \nto do the right thing.\n    If you get the housecleaning there, take these people out \nof the positions, maybe they would do the right thing and the \ngovernment would not be facing all of these liability suits, \nthis discontent in the workplace, and abuse of authority. They \nknow what is going on. These are career people. These District \nManagers, like in Milwaukee, that is an office that you would \nthink the Gestapo ran, not Americans run that office.\n    They are rewarding blacks to do the wrong things, and my \nparents did not teach me that. I am from Texas. I went to \nschools where they taught people to do the right thing. But in \nMilwaukee, you are rewarded for doing the wrong thing, and in \nthe national IRS office that is also a problem.\n    You are finding people who know they are not qualified. \nThey are being promoted, they are happy, they are going to \ndefend the system. People who are qualified and not being given \nequitable treatment and fairness and justice, they are going to \nbe opposed to the system. So you have got to clean house.\n    The Chairman. I would say to the distinguished witness that \nin the legislation to come before the Senate, one of the things \nwe are doing is providing the opportunity for the new \nCommissioner to bring in some new faces, so I think that is a \nvery, very important initiative.\n    Let me conclude my questions at this point. I want to make \nsure I am clear, Mr. Warren. Is it your testimony that you \nfound evidence of discrimination against whites, blacks, and \nHispanics in IRS?\n    Mr. Warren. What you have got is a little game that is \nbeing played. It is a maintenance of power game. You put \nsomebody in position and you are at the top. If they are black \nand there are some whites you do not like, you put them up that \nperson, like the black female secretary I showed you with the \nacting manager.\n    You put somebody in charge who is black and let them come \ndown on the whites, and that way you get rid of them. You could \ndo it white on white, black on black or whatever, but you are \nusing the system to select management and officials whom you \nknow are people of virtual moral bankruptcy and they will do \nwhatever they have to do just to keep their job without any \nthought of the consequences.\n    So what I am saying is, you have people there, blacks who \nare not doing the right thing. They know they are not doing the \nright thing, because you hear the employees talking about them \nall over the place. But the fact becomes, they are favorites of \nmanagement because of the kind of people they are. They are not \ngood people.\n    The Chairman. Senator Moynihan."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. \nWarren.\n    You referred to the situation in Milwaukee. I understand \nthat the Department of Treasury is leading an EEO study of the \nMilwaukee office, and I am sure you are aware of that.\n    Mr. Warren. Let me just say, Senator Moynihan, I have \ntalked with the President. This was faxed to me last night from \nthe Criminal Investigation Division in Milwaukee.\n    Let me just say something about what is going on in \nMilwaukee about that task force. I think it is partially a \nfraud. I am going to be very frank. It is kind of harsh \nlanguage, but there are some fraudulent aspects of this. You \nhave people when the panel originally was started that were the \nreal culprits of the problem.\n    What they should have done in Milwaukee is gone outside and \ngotten independent, non-agency people and a staff person from \nthe agency, a contractor or something like we did in our school \nsystem, to deal with these problems.\n    What you are doing here, is the EEO officer at the national \nEEO office, as far as I am concerned and as far as the NAACP in \nMilwaukee is concerned, is trying to control this thing, but \nthey are controlling it to make sure the outcome is already \npredetermined."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Well, can I just understand that the \nfinal report will be issued to Senators Kohl, Feingold, and \nCongressmen Barrett and Kleska. I am sure they will be vigilant \nin attending to the issues you raised.\n    I look forward, Mr. Chairman, if we need to be----\n    Mr. Warren. Senator Moynihan, may I say something in \nreference to that issue? They have not been forthcoming with \nMr. Kohl, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kleska, and Mr. Barrett, I do not \nthink, either. I think the IRS in Milwaukee is just like the \nIRS at the national office. They release only the data they \nwant. I asked for employment data, we have not gotten it. We \nhave not received anything from them.\n    So I think what is happening in Milwaukee, you have got \nsome black people up there in Milwaukee, as far as I am \nconcerned, and most people at the NAACP is concerned, that \nought to be in jail for their criminal acts."

"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you as well, \nMr. Warren, for bringing this to our attention. I would ask you \nto review some of the specific sections of the bill that we \nhave that attempt to address this and many other personnel \nissues as well.\n    If you want to take notes on it, Section 1101 of the \nlegislation, in creating an oversight board, sets out the terms \nof authority, as well as the responsibility that includes \nreviewing plans for training, education, and other personnel \nissues.\n    Section 1102 of the bill requires the Commissioner to have \na demonstrated ability in management; it is fairly \nstraightforward. The Chairman of our committee has talked about \nthat as well. It is in both the House and the Senate bill.\n    Section 1102 requires a semiannual report on the status and \ndisposition of employee misconduct and abuse allegation. \nSection 1201, both the House and the Senate bill provides more \neffective management of employee contact, providing flexibility \nprovisions, again, as the Chairman has referenced.\n    Section 1205 of both the Senate and House bill requires \nsubmission of an employee training plan to Congress. Section \n3709, some additional procedures for employees to provide \nconfidential information to our committees and to report on \nallegations of employee misconduct or taxpayer abuse.\n    As I pull them out, those are the sections that reference \nthe situations that you are describing. There may be some \nadditional things that you would have for us to consider.\n    Again, the Majority Leader has indicated that relatively \nsoon we are going to bring this up on the floor, so any \nsuggestion that you have got to us on ways to change this law \nto help reduce the amount of discrimination that is obviously a \ngovernment-wide problem would be very much appreciated.\n    Mr. Warren. Thanks very much.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Kerrey.\n    Senator Grassley?\n    Senator Grassley. I think, once again, we have an example \nhere, as we did in the first panel, of accountability at the \nIRS. In the first panel we had mistreatment of taxpayers, in \nthis case we have got mistreatment of employees. In either \ncase, people who are meting out mistreatment have to be held \naccountable. The most top management at the IRS is going to \nhave to see that people are punished for this sort of \nwrongdoing so that people who are mistreated can do their job.\n    The people you are telling about cannot be good tax \ncollectors, good government employees, when they have this sort \nof environment of intimidation. We talk about the culture of \nintimidation as it is used against the taxpayer. We have a \nculture of intimidation here that is used against the \nemployees, to the detriment of the goals of the IRS to collect \nall the money that is legally owed.\n    So I want to take advantage of my few minutes here to get \nyou, because you are on television, to be counseling people who \nmight be watching who have the problems that you are talking \nabout. What would you tell current IRS employees who are having \nproblems with racial or sexual discrimination; what would you \nrecommend that they do to most effectively deal with their \nproblem?\n    Mr. Warren. Let me just say, there is no easy solution to \nyour question. What we are trying to do at the NAACP is we are \ntrying to release our Federal Sector Employment Discrimination \nReport, which will be released on June 17 at the Renaissance \nHotel in Washington, DC here at a breakfast. We are trying to \ntake affidavits and documents.\n    We are going to give Mr. Clinton a notebook just like this \nwith a couple of hundred affidavits from people all over this \ncountry, with all religions and all races, talking about \nFederal sector employment discrimination.\n    We take in blacks, we take in whites, we take in Asians, we \ntake in Hispanics. We are taking anybody that believes in \ndecency and justice, regardless of who they are. If they have \nbeen treated wrongly and we do not agree with everything they \ndo, we still are going to take them because it is the right \nthing to do.\n    Senator Grassley. How wide is retaliation against those \nemployees who complain and who stand up for what might be their \nrights?\n    Mr. Warren. I would say it is 90 percent of the time, and \nit is a death sentence for upward mobility and you are going to \nbe ostracized, you are going to be punished, and you are going \nto be subject to retaliation. There is a 90 percent chance. I \nwould say it is probably close to 90 percent. I know of very \nfew people who have filed a complaint and not been subject to \nwhat I call State-sanctioned terrorism right after they filed \nthe complaint.\n    Senator Grassley. In other words, they are kind of like a \nskunk at a Sunday afternoon picnic.\n    Mr. Warren. That is about right.\n    Senator Grassley. There is a great deal of peer pressure to \ngo along, to get along, not to complain.\n    Mr. Warren. Yes. If you complain, you are virtually a \ncommunist, a troublemaker, or what they call a trouble \nemployee. They have all kinds of names they put to you, but it \nis anything except being a child of God.\n    Senator Grassley. Do you know this, or is it always behind \nthe scenes that this evidence is brought to you? Is it quite \nobvious to you as an employee that you are labeled as a \ntroublemaker?\n    Mr. Warren. Let me put it like this. The blacks, the \nHispanics, the Asians, whoever they are that we have heard \nfrom, we talked to, have affidavits we have at home, these \npeople have career track records of being outstanding.\n    Let us take this GS-13 white female whom I was talking \nabout right here in Washington, DC today under going mental \nfitness for duty testing as if she has gone crazy. She has got \nawards, she has letters of accommodation, everything else until \nshe filed that EEO complaint. The minute you file the EEO \ncomplaint is like you are going under a death sentence.\n    Senator Grassley. That psychiatric requirement of treatment \nthat you are talking about is too reminiscent of the Soviet \nsystem where everybody who tried to buck the system ended up in \na psychiatric hospital, which was another way of being in \nprison.\n    Mr. Warren. Well, the people out in the field refer to the \nCriminal Investigation Division as another State-sanctioned \nterrorist group of the Gestapo from Germany, worse than the \nproblems we had in World War II. People are terrified when they \nhave to deal with these agencies because they know the agency \nhas unlimited resources.\n    The Criminal Investigation Division has abused people in \nHouston. We know people first-hand, blacks and whites. These \npeople are saying they have done nothing wrong. These are good, \nhardworking individual Americans who gave this country their \nall in all, and now 15 or 20 years later they are being subject \nto just terrorism by the State.\n    Senator Grassley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Thank you for your testimony.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Grassley.\n    Senator Lott?"
"lott","Senator Lott","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Mr. Warren, thank you for your testimony here today. In \nyour testimony, you described several cases of racial \ndiscrimination against IRS employees and intimidation of those \nemployees.\n    But what really struck me was, you are describing a subtle, \nsinister, systematic problem in which you are maintaining top \nIRS management has a coordinated strategy to give all these \nexcellent ratings to blacks who have low ranking positions and \ngive unjustified, you maintain, low performance to those that \nare higher ranking positions.\n    Now, this would have to be some sort of coordinated \nstrategy by the top IRS management. Is that what you are \nclaiming?\n    Mr. Warren. Let me rephrase and clarify. What I am saying \nis, it happens so frequently when they file the complaints, \nwhen you get a chance to talk to people and get their \nperformance ratings on the individuals who file the complaints \nand documentation within the office, when you finally get \naround to finding out who got the higher ratings, you see this \nproportion of the secretaries, the GS-5, 6's, 7's, and 8's got \nthe real high ratings, and the blacks with the most skills got, \nnot lower ratings, but they will not get the top. You need the \ntop to move up. In other words, you cannot make the competitive \nannouncement roster."
"lott","Senator Lott","lott","Senator Lott","    So you are basing this on statistics that you \nhave been able to get.\n    Mr. Warren. Cases we have looked at, right. But they are \nnot just at the national office. We are talking about folks in \nHouston, Milwaukee, we are talking about folks in Missouri, and \nwe are talking about folks in Chicago, who have talked to other \npeople who say they have the same problem out there. One of the \nnational civil rights leaders has some of those cases. I have \nnot seen the files."
"lott","Senator Lott","lott","Senator Lott","    Do you have reason to believe that top \nmanagement people in those district offices talk among \nthemselves about that or that there is some communication in \nthis regard from the national office, or is this an unspoken, \nunwritten, very subtle thing, or is it some sort of a \ncoordinated effort? I mean, I find it hard to believe that it \ncould happen the way that you describe it without some thinking \nabout it beforehand.\n    Mr. Warren. Let me just say this."
"lott","Senator Lott","lott","Senator Lott","    I am not questioning that it is accurate. It \nis like so much of what we have heard about IRS. It is mind \nboggling.\n    Mr. Warren. I do not think anything is in writing, but you \nhave a culture. Let me just say, I deal with a lot of people, \npolice people across the country, on these issues. Sometimes \nyou can go into a place and you can see people who are doing \nwhat they think management wants, and nobody is going to put \nthat on a piece of paper. But it is a culture. It is a \ncultural, environmental thing, what you are responding to. You \nknow if you do certain things that might be morally bankrupt it \nis going to get you ahead, so you do it. If somebody does not \npat you on the wrist or put some sanctions or reprimand against \nyou, you are going to keep on doing it.\n    A lot of times the people who are doing this are rewarded \nby being promoted higher and higher. I do not think it is what \nyou call an organized crime family, but I think it is a culture \nacceptance, environmental problem."
"lott","Senator Lott","lott","Senator Lott","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Lott.\n    Senator Conrad?"
"conrad","Senator Conrad","lott","Senator Lott","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I \nwant to just make a statement based on a conversation I just \nhad as I left the hearing room. Earlier we had a panel of three \nwitnesses, and I found their testimony certainly compelling and \nof real concern with respect to the way the Revenue Service had \napproached them.\n    But as I left this hall, I was stopped by a man who was \nvery agitated and he said, Senator, you have got an obligation, \nand this committee has got an obligation, to get both sides of \nthe story before you make a judgment. He said, unfortunately, \nyou are not getting both sides of the story, you are getting \none side of the story.\n    He said to me, I know of facts that are not being presented \nto you, but I cannot talk about them because the IRS has not \nbeen given a waiver by the taxpayers in question, so we cannot \ngive the other side of the story. He said, I would lose my job \nif I gave what I know to be another side of this story.\n    So I say that, Mr. Chairman. I do think we have an \nobligation, before we reach judgment, to get both sides of the \nstory. This particular gentleman was very concerned that people \nwere named here today who are in the Internal Revenue Service \nwho are, he felt, being judged guilty without ever having their \nchance to tell their side.\n    He said, you know, I wonder if people are going to be able \nto get a fair hearing if we do not have a chance to get both \nsides of the story given to the public. I would say again, this \ngentleman was very agitated. I could tell he was very sincere."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Mr. Chairman, let me associate myself with \nwhat Senator Conrad has said, especially since names have been \npublicly inserted into the record, especially when we are \ndealing with taxpayers who are bringing to us stories that \nsaid, our reputations were ruined as a consequence of what was \nsaid publicly. We should not allow the same thing to happen.\n    It is very important, especially as we go into \nconsideration of changing the law, that we not just change the \nlaw as a consequence of hearing one side and not the other."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    I do think we have that clear obligation. \nLet me say that I also believe, Mr. Chairman, as I expressed \nthis morning, that what we heard here today indicates to me \nthat there are cases where the Internal Revenue Service is \nacting totally inappropriately in terms of how they are \napproaching taxpayers. I mean, sending in armed agents and this \nkind of heavy-handed treatment."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","conrad","Senator Conrad","    SWAT team."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    This is not the way to approach taxpayers."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Has the Chairman thought about offering an \nopportunity for Attorney General Reno to testify, for example, \nto come up and talk to us about the issue of the U.S. Attorneys \nthat Senator Moynihan was raising?\n    The Chairman. No. But Friday, I would point out to my \ndistinguished colleague, we have, of course, extended an \ninvitation to the IRS Commissioner to come here to present \nwhatever they think is appropriate, so there will be an \nopportunity at that time."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Well, Mr. Chairman, if I might just add \nthis point, though. The problem is, if the taxpayers do not \ngive waivers, he cannot present the other side of the story. So \nI think we need to be asking the witnesses that come here if \nthey will grant waivers so the other side of the story can be \ntold.\n    Otherwise, Mr. Rossotti can come up here and talk in \ngeneral terms, but he cannot talk about the specifics and we \nmay make judgments based on only hearing one side of the story. \nIf there is one thing I have experienced in public life, making \na judgment based on one side of the story can lead you down a \npath that is just wrong. I do not think that is the intention \nof any of us.\n    I think we all share a view of wanting to resolve problems \nthat we have uncovered with respect to the Revenue Service, but \nthey ought to be based on facts. The only way I know, the best \nway to get at facts, is to get both sides of the story. I thank \nthe Chairman."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Well said.\n    The Chairman. As I said, the Commissioner has been invited \nto come Friday. He will have the opportunity to present what he \nthinks appropriate."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Mr. Chairman, can you comment on inviting \nthe Attorney General? I mean, a lot of this is a law \nenforcement issue.\n    The Chairman. Well, I think the Ranking Member raises a \nvery important question. As I said, we think it is something \nthat William Webster ought to look at, and we all ought to look \nat. Subsequently, if it seems appropriate, we can, in the \nfuture, invite the Attorney General."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Well, all right."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    I appreciate, Mr. Chairman, your response. \nBut the dilemma, of course, is that we are about to consider \nchanging the law. The Attorney General has the responsibility \nof doing the enforcement effort of the IRS and all this stuff \ngets referred to her people.\n    The Chairman. Well, I would point out that yesterday there \nwere people on your side wanting to raise it earlier, now today \nthey want to delay it. There is no perfect time. I think we \nhave----"
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    But, Mr. Chairman, could we not leave it \nthat we will get in touch with Attorney General Reno and see \nwhat she thinks and we will pass it on to you?\n    The Chairman. All right. We will leave it that way."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Thank you.\n    The Chairman. Thank you.\n    It is my understanding that there is a vote beginning in \nthe next several minutes. So I think what we will do, is recess \nuntil the end of that vote."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Thanking Mr. Warren.\n    The Chairman. Yes. That is the next thing, is I want to \nthank you for being here today, Mr. Warren. It is very much \nappreciated and very helpful to this committee. Thank you very \nmuch.\n    Mr. Warren. Thank you.\n    The Chairman. The committee is in recess.\n    The Chairman. The committee will please come to order.\n    A question has been raised as to a waiver by the taxpayers \nheard this morning, whether the IRS can comment on their cases. \nLet me remind the panel that the IRS has already made an effort \nto make their case against these taxpayers and could not \nsustain any criminal action. The taxpayers were not found \nguilty of anything.\n    Let me say that I am aware of no mitigating circumstances \nthat would excuse the type of treatment of taxpayers that we \nheard about this morning. As to the waivers, that is between \nthe taxpayer's counsel and themselves. I certainly would not \nrecommend giving the IRS a second shot at destroying \nreputations after the compelling testimony that we heard here \ntoday.\n    Let me point out that Commissioner Rossotti and I agreed \nthat we would not seek waivers, nor did Commissioner Rossotti \nwant to be questioned on specific cases.\n    Now it is my pleasure----"
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Mr. Chairman, I want to alert you that I \ndisagree with the decision on the request for a waiver. I have \nno desire to retry those cases, actually, to the innocence or \nguilt of the witnesses. I do not want to drag them through \nthat. I quite agree with you, no taxpayer should be treated in \nthis fashion. I do not take the side of the IRS in this matter. \nBut we are making a determination about what the law should be.\n    It is going to be very difficult for us to make a \ndetermination about the law unless Commissioner Rossotti, who \nhas the authority only the witnesses can grant him, can talk \neither generally or specifically about the cases.\n    So I respectfully disagree with the ruling and I will ask \nat some point, if it is not changed, for a roll call vote to \nenable us to at least approach the witnesses and see if they \nwill allow a waiver to be granted so Mr. Rossotti, who will \nalso, I am quite certain, say that he does not condone this \nkind of behavior. He does not condone behavior that harasses \ntaxpayers, that bust down the door, and so forth.\n    I would say, further, Mr. Chairman, no drug kingpin or \nmoney launderer has a big, flashing neon light on their \nforeheads saying, I am a drug kingpin and a money launderer; \nthey wear dark suits and red ties and they look normal. They \nhang out. They live in the neighborhoods.\n    So Attorney General Reno, we have tasked her with a \nresponsibility. We have passed legislation, after legislation, \nafter legislation saying, go get those drug kingpins. I do not \nhear an awful lot of concern about Fourth Amendment rights on \nthe floor of the Senate when these things are being debated.\n    So what we do, is we give her the authority to go after it, \nand we need to hear from her in order to be able to determine \nwhether or not a change in the law might actually result in her \ncoming back 2 years from now and saying, congratulations, \nSenator Kerrey, you just made it possible for money launderers \nand drug kingpins to survive in this country.\n    So I hope, whether it is in written testimony or some sort \nof solicitation, Mr. Chairman--I appreciate very much what you \nare trying to do and I am not trying to be a thorn in your side \non this issue, but I know we are going to come to the floor of \nthe Senate and debate this law relatively soon, thanks to your \nleadership.\n    I just hope that we are prepared to consider not that these \nindividuals should be drug out again, but to consider that our \naction could make matters worse, not better.\n    The Chairman. Well, I would point out that everything that \nwas discussed this morning is in the public realm so that there \nis no confidential information. But in any event, what we are \nlooking at is the process and we think that there is adequate \nopportunity to discuss that. But, as we said, as far as the \nAttorney General is concerned, we would look at that."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    We would look at that. Mr. Chairman, I \nwonder if the staff could not meet with some of the IRS staff \nand just talk about this matter and bring you their judgment?\n    The Chairman. That would be fine."

"","","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Ms. Long. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, we \nwelcome this opportunity to inform you about two serious \nproblems that have plagued the Criminal Investigation Division \nof the IRS for many years.\n    The first problem concerns the CID's systematic inability \nto keep track of the work of its 3,352 criminal investigators, \nmen and women who, under the law, are among the most powerful \nof all Federal enforcement agents.\n    The second problem concerns the inexplicably erratic way \nthe Nation's tax laws are enforced throughout the U.S. While \nthese two problems at first seem unrelated, we believe they \nare, in fact, directly linked, that the lack of accountability \ninherent in the CID's faulty bookkeeping system undermines the \nability of this important investigative force to enforce the \nNation's tax laws in an effective and fair way.\n    Mr. Burnham. Before presenting the evidence that supports \nour conclusions, we would like to make one general observation. \nDistrict to district variation in the enforcement of any \nFederal law is natural and to be expected. The United States is \na vast country. Sioux Falls, South Dakota, after all, has \nnothing in common with Miami, Florida, and no one would expect \nFederal enforcement in the two cities to be similar. But the \nvariations that emerge from a careful examination of data that \nwe have obtained from the Justice Department and the courts \nappear to go way beyond such natural occurring outcomes.\n    It is fair to ask, for example, why for the last five years \nthe per capita number of IRS convictions in Memphis, Tennessee, \nin Ashville, North Carolina, in Charleston, West Virginia, \nMobile, Alabama, are at least twice that racked up in important \nfinancial and business centers like Texas, South Houston, like \nin Boston, or in Los Angeles.\n    Two questions present themselves about the erratic \nenforcement patterns of the CID. First, mindful of the \nconstitutional mandate that government must work to assure the \nAmerican people equal protection under the law, is the IRS \ntreating similarly situated citizens in similar ways?\n    Second, at a time of scarce government resources is the IRS \neffectively targeting its criminal enforcement activities in \nthe areas and against the individuals and organizations where \nthey are most needed?\n    We believe that one reason the IRS has shown a lack of \nconcern about these and other hard-to-explain regional patterns \nof criminal enforcement, it is a surprising fact that the IRS \nis unable to accurately track what its own criminal \ninvestigators are doing.\n    As suggested above, this is not nearly a question of \nexpecting the IRS to meet some decidedly minimal bookkeeping \nstandards, although there is great irony in its failure to do \nso. When the senior managers of an enforcement force with the \npowers of the IRS's Criminal Investigation Division are unable \nto keep track of the activities of their agents to even provide \nCongress and the public an accurate count of the number of \npeople its investigators have convicted or sentenced to prison, \nsystematic supervision is impossible.\n    Lacking effective internal oversight, genuine abuses by \nindividual agents can go easily unnoticed. Outside oversight by \ninstitutions like the Treasury Department's Inspector General, \nthe General Accounting Office, or this committee, is \nproblematic. More broadly, we are confronted by an agency that \nis outside the required boundaries of a working representative \ndemocracy.\n    Ms. Long. We understand that these are serious allegations, \nbut we believe that the longstanding failure of the IRS to \nprovide the American people with an accurate accounting of this \ncritical enforcement function is a serious problem. There are \ntwo related points.\n    First, in addition to being unable to track the work of its \nCID investigators, there is strong evidence that the IRS is \nengaged in an active public information campaign intended to \nsubstantially exaggerate its effectiveness in this area. Put \ndirectly, the IRS has been hyping the numbers.\n    Second, there is no question that for several years the IRS \nhas refused to examine the compelling evidence regarding the \nexistence of this problem that it, in fact, has worked to avoid \nthe accurate balancing of its checkbook.\n    Mr. Burnham. What is the basis for our finding that the \ncriminal enforcement counts of the IRS, the numbers that have \nlong been relied upon by the Office of Management and Budget, \nCongressional committees, the GAO, news organizations, and the \npublic are inaccurate and misleading?\n    As you know, TRAC is a data gathering, data research, and \ndata distribution organization associated with Syracuse \nUniversity. For the last 9 years, under the Freedom of \nInformation Act, TRAC has obtained data tapes from the \nexecutive office of U.S. Attorneys. According to Justice \nDepartment manuals, these tapes contain a detailed record about \nevery occasion when an investigative agency has recommended the \nprosecution of a criminal matter.\n    In which of the 90 judicial districts was the matter \nreferred? When was the matter referred? Which agency made the \nreferral? What was the most important criminal charge? Which \nmatters were declined for prosecution; why? Which referrals \nresulted in the prosecutors bringing formal charges, in winning \nconvictions, in sending individuals to prison?\n    From this matter-by-matter information, TRAC has developed \ncounts and batting averages for several investigative agencies, \nincluding the IRS. According to the Justice Department data, \nthe IRS, from 1992 to 1996, referred about 23,000 investigative \nmatters to the prosecutors that the IRS had determined should \nbe prosecuted.\n    During that same period, again, according to the Justice \nDepartment, Federal prosecutors went forward with about 12,400 \nprosecutions and won conviction in 9,350 convictions, and sent \n4,800 individuals to prison. These counts cover all IRS \ncriminal enforcement actions, those for tax fraud as well as \nthose considerable number of cases aimed at special areas such \nas drugs and money laundering.\n    In its annual report covering the same 5-year period, \nhowever, the IRS presents a very different picture of its \ncriminal enforcement activities. While accounts of the number \nof referrals are about the same, when it comes to prosecutions, \nconvictions, and prison sentences the Justice Department and \nthe Tax Agency seem to be living in very different worlds. The \nIRS, in fact, claims about 50 percent more prosecutions, 70 \npercent more convictions, and twice as many individuals sent to \nprison as does the Justice Department.\n    The simple fact that the counts of the two institutions are \nso very different is surprising by itself, but the inconsistent \nnature of these numbers concerning a closely-linked \nadministrative process is almost impossible to explain. How can \nit be that the IRS claims 50 percent more prosecutions than the \nJustice Department, but then reports twice as many people sent \nto prison?\n    In response to a series of inquiries going back more than 2 \nyears and an extensive discussion with a senior CID official \nlast week, the IRS has been unable to explain the astonishing \ninconsistency of its claims. There is additional evidence \nsupporting TRAC's findings that the IRS counts are \nsubstantially incorrect.\n    This evidence has emerged in connection with TRAC's belief \nthat our mission does not end with the simple collection and \ndistribution of data. Equally important, we believe, are our \nefforts to ensure that the information is as accurate and \ncomprehensive as possible.\n    In this connection, we compare the counts that emerge from \none agency's records with those developed by another about a \nparticular government function. The point here is, when two \nindependent bodies come up with the same answers the confidence \nin the accuracy of these answers is greatly enhanced.\n    That is why TRAC spent considerable time comparing the \nenforcement counts that emerge from the Justice Department data \ntapes with similar information developed by the administrative \noffice of the U.S. courts.\n    We decided to focus our examination on the core \nresponsibility of the CID, tax fraud. Because of definitional \ndifferences and other such problems relating to any two large \ndata systems, exact matches in such counts are rare.\n    Ms. Long. But when we examined the numbers of the Justice \nDepartment and the courts about the tax fraud activities of the \nCID, we found that the 5-year counts were in substantial \nagreement. According to the Justice Department data tapes, for \nexample, Federal prosecutors charged 4,854 individuals with tax \nfraud. According to the courts, there were 4,654 such charges.\n    When it came to convictions, the counts of the two \nindependent organizations again were quite similar, 4,139 to \n4,187. Considering individual who are sentenced to prison, \nJustice recorded a total of 1,690, the courts 1,662. The \nsimilarity in these key performance numbers is striking and \nlends credence to their general reliability.\n    But when the very similar tax prosecution numbers of the \nJustice Department and the courts are compared with the tax \nprosecution numbers of the IRS, we found surprising disparities \nand inconsistencies. Here are the actual numbers. As just \nnoted, from 1992 to 1996, records of the Justice Department and \nthe courts indicate that a total of about 4,100 individuals \nwere convicted for tax fraud. The IRS, on the other hand, \nclaims 6,030 convictions on such charges.\n    The gap for individuals sentenced to prison for tax fraud \nis even more glaring. While Justice and the courts count about \n1,600 of these unfortunates during the 5-year period, the IRS \nboasts of sending 3,595 such individuals to prison, more than \ntwice the number.\n    Thus, the impressive success rates claimed by the IRS in \nits official annual report, the data relied upon by the General \nAccounting Office in its investigative reports to this \ncommittee and the rest of Congress about the CID is totally \ncontradicted by the information compiled by two institutions \nwith much less immediate interest in the outcome, the Justice \nDepartment and the courts.\n    Mr. Burnham. There, thus, is strong and disturbing evidence \nthat an important arm of the IRS has been unable to accurately \ntrack its work product, the prosecution of tax violators, and \nthat it has routinely hyped its enforcement achievements.\n    Almost as distressing, however, is the evidence that the \nCriminal Investigating Division has for the last two years \nrefused to balance its checkbook. While individuals citizens \nare free to keep their cash balance in their heads and pay \npenalties when this easygoing accounting system results in a \nbounced check, this option is not appropriate for an arm of the \nIRS.\n    This is especially true when, under the mandate of the \nGovernment Performance and Results Act, all Federal agencies \nare now required to establish specific goals and explain how \nwell they are achieving them.\n    The evidence regarding the IRS's active disinterest in \nbalancing its checkbook has emerged in connection with a unique \neffort by TRAC to provide all American citizens with detailed \ninformation about the performance of the IRS and three other \nFederal agencies.\n    TRAC has pursued this goal by mounting special web sites. \nComplete with colored maps, graphs, tables, explanatory \nmaterial, and the text of relevant laws, these sites gives \ncitizens a unique way to obtain authoritative information about \nthe district patterns and long-term trends in how the IRS, FBI, \nthe DEA, and ATF are enforcing the law.\n    The sites are based on data TRAC has obtained from the \nJustice Department, the Office of Personnel Management, the \nagencies themselves, the courts, the GAO, the Census Bureau, \nand other sources.\n    Ms. Long. From the very beginning of this effort, we were \ntroubled by the obvious problems in the accuracy and \nconsistency of the criminal enforcement information available \nin the annual data publications of the IRS.\n    In 1997, after determining that the information from the \nJustice Department and courts conflicted with the contradictory \nclaims of the IRS, we added a prominent segment to the IRS web \nsite stating that our investigation had determined, ``The \ninformation now being provided the public by the IRS about its \ncriminal enforcement activities is substantially misleading and \ninaccurate.''\n    Before detailing our criticism on TRAC's web site, we had \nwritten the IRS a series of letters outlining the serious \nproblems we had uncovered and requesting the Agency for Public \nRecord Information that might have allowed us to determine why \nthe agency was unable to track its own activities.\n    One specific request was for a district by district list of \nall IRS defendants, along with relevant docket numbers, \nprocessing dates, and specific statutory codes, who was \nprosecuted, convicted, or sentenced to prison from 1992 to \ndate.\n    The IRS has resisted our inquiries, flatly denying that its \ndata system was seriously flawed, and not producing the list of \ndefendants and other information we had requested.\n    On August 2, 1996, for example, Tad Brown, the Assistant \nCommissioner for Criminal Investigation responded to TRAC's \ncriticism by writing that the IRS was ``satisfied with the \ntracking of this information through our own data bases,'' and \nthat the agency did not ``see the need to reconcile or verify \nthe records with those maintained by the executive office of \nthe U.S. Attorney.''\n    In a letter on March 31, 1997, Brown wrote that, ``We \ncontinue to stand by our statistics and cannot assist you in \nreconciling our data with that of other agencies.''\n    Mr. Burnham. But what makes this mess truly discouraging is \nthe fact that it is not new. In fact, more than 15 years ago \nthe problems were publicly identified by two expert studies \nsupported by the Federal Government. One was completed in 1978 \nby a panel of the National Academy of Public Administrators, \nthe second, commissioned by the Justice Department in 1980, was \nwritten by Susan Long.\n    However, the IRS's head-in-the-sand attitude about the \nshortcomings we have documented may be coming to an end. We are \nencouraged by Commissioner Charles Rossotti's concern about the \nreliability of the agency's information system and the \nimportance of such information to effective management.\n    The United States pays a lot of lip service to our system \nof checks and balances to the theory that we are a government \nof public laws and not of whimsical bureaucrats. But unless the \nactions of a powerful government agency like the IRS are \naccurately and carefully monitored, our celebrated checks and \nbalances are a sham.\n    John Adams said it well in a letter he wrote to Thomas \nJefferson 180 years ago. ``Power,'' Adams said, ``must never be \ntrusted without a check.''\n    Thank you very much. We would love to get your questions.\n    First of all, let me thank both of you for a very \ninsightful report, a very shocking report, I might add. I was \njust looking at some of the statements you made. ``IRS is \nunable to track what its own Criminal Investigation agents are \ndoing; lacking effective external oversight, genuine abuses by \nindividual agents can easily go unnoticed.''\n    Then you go on to say, ``More broadly, we are confronted by \nan agency that is outside the required boundaries of a working \nrepresentative democracy.''\n    I wonder if you would explain exactly what you mean by \nthat.\n    Mr. Burnham. We give police agencies, enforcement agencies, \na lot of power. That power is needed. We need a New York City \nPolice Department, we need an IRS, we need enforcement. It is \npart of our system of assuring that society complies with the \nrules.\n    But we also must insist that these agencies live within the \nlaw. We established a very complicated system for doing that, \nthe Congress and the courts. And if the Congress and the courts \nare unable to get good information about how many arrests the \ncop is making in a precinct or what the CID is doing, you get \nthe horror stories that you have heard today, and the horror \nstories that I uncovered in my book 10 years ago. We have to \nhold them more accountable.\n    The Chairman. Ms. Long, would you have anything to add?\n    Ms. Long. Well, without information you do not know what \nthey are doing, and the managers within IRS cannot effectively \nmanage if you do not have accurate information about what your \npersonnel are doing.\n    The Chairman. I have here a copy of the IRS so-called fact \nsheet. As you know, the IRS recently released the sheet that \nprofiles its Criminal Investigation Division. Your group, TRAC, \nis, of course, an expert on IRS. Both of you are well known for \nthe excellence of your work.\n    How would you describe the so-called facts contained in \nthis report, accurate reporting, inaccurate, wishful fiction?\n    Ms. Long. Well, the report covers a lot of ground so I do \nnot think you can summarize it in that simple fashion. But as \nto the numbers it presents, as to the number of cases that it \nrecommends for prosecution, the number that are prosecuted, the \nnumber of convictions, the number sentenced to prison, those \ndata do not at all correspond with those kept by the Justice \nDepartment or by the Federal courts.\n    The Chairman. Well, let me get a little more specific. The \nIRS says, of roughly 5,000 cases its CID initiated last year, \nthe conviction rate of these adjudicated was 93 percent. Is \nthat correct?\n    Ms. Long. Well, basically, if you look at the Justice \nDepartment figures for the 5-year period for 1992 to 1996, it \nshows a conviction rate of about 82 percent, not 93 percent. If \nyou just focus on tax fraud, the number is around 88 percent.\n    But this does not include those cases that IRS recommends \nfor prosecution and are never prosecuted. If those are \nincluded, then the figure falls to something like 44 percent \nfor all cases, and about 58 percent for tax fraud cases.\n    The Chairman. It falls to 44 percent, and 58 percent.\n    Ms. Long. Fifty-eight percent. But that, of course, is \nincluding those that are never prosecuted."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    The U.S. Attorney just decides not to \nproceed.\n    Ms. Long. He does not prosecute. So the conviction rate I \nbelieve that IRS was referring to at 93 percent was looking at \nthose that were prosecuted, how many were convicted. It is \nhigher than the Justice Department figures, but depending on \nyour base of 82 percent versus 88 percent, something in that \nrange.\n    The Chairman. Do you have any idea how those percentages \nstack up against other Federal law enforcement agencies?\n    Mr. Burnham. Because the Federal agencies like the FBI, \nDEA, and the INS investigate very different kinds of cases, \ncomparing the success rates can be misleading. However, when \nthe IRS's performance is compared on charges of a similar \nnature, such as money laundering, for example, just taking \nmoney laundering statutes, the agency's record appears to be \ncomparable with that of the FBI. Not better, not worse, but \nabout the same. Of course, that contradicts with their claim \nthat they are superior to all other agencies.\n    The Chairman. Now, the IRS fact sheet maintains that, \n``convictions may result in substantial prison sentences, as \nwell as payment of fines, civil taxes, and penalties.'' Can you \ngive us a more concrete explanation of the results of these \nefforts?\n    Ms. Long. Yes. Obviously, prison can result from those \nkinds of efforts. The IRS's annual report usually claims \nsomething on the order of 75 to 80 percent of those that are \nconvicted end up with prison sentences.\n    If you look at the Justice Department and court data, it is \nreally quite different. It is more like around half, 51 \npercent. If you look just at tax fraud cases, it is more like \n37 percent. So, there is just a huge disparity here.\n    The Chairman. You made some passing reference, and both \nSenator Moynihan and I have also, referring to the fact that \nthe Commissioner has set up a new organization headed by \nWilliam Webster to review the CID. I think that is an excellent \nmove. I wonder what advice each of you would have for Judge \nWebster as he starts to undertake this review.\n    Mr. Burnham. Well, Judge Webster should not rely on the \nIRS's internal management data. He must obtain data from the \ncourts, the Justice Department and the Sentencing Commission. \nHe must put them together, look at them, and then examine the \nperformance of the IRS.\n    The Chairman. Ms. Long, would you like to add?\n    Ms. Long. I just echo those comments. I think they would be \nhelpful.\n    The Chairman. Senator Moynihan?"
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Just to thank two exceptionally gifted \ninvestigators. Not everybody can do the work that you have done \nwith just a couple of computers and a Xerox machine. It is \nreally remarkable.\n    The GAO has told us that a problem for the IRS in this \nregard is that they do not have the technology. We keep running \ninto that problem all over this organization. Would you think \nthat is likely?\n    Ms. Long. Everything I know suggests that IRS's information \nsystems are in a dreadful shambles."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Yes. Yes.\n    Ms. Long. But this goes beyond that. This goes beyond that, \nI would say.\n    Mr. Burnham. Senator Moynihan, we asked for a list of \npeople that they were indicted as a result of their \ninvestigations or were convicted. That is not very many people."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    It is not an overwhelming number.\n    Mr. Burnham. No.\n    Ms. Long. Or very complicated.\n    Mr. Burnham. Or very complicated."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Yes.\n    Mr. Burnham. They have not produced that. I cannot believe \nthat is a computer problem, that is a will problem."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    That correspondence you had was not \nexactly consumer friendly.\n    Mr. Burnham. No."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Yes. Yes. Well, sir, another matter to be \nraised. We are much in the debt of these two academics and \ncitizens. You are kind of both in these regards, are you not? \nWe much appreciate it.\n    The Chairman. We do, indeed.\n    Senator Kerrey?"
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Mr. Chairman, I have actually had an \nopportunity to hear Ms. Long and Mr. Burnham's testimony before \non the issue of examinations, where we have a similar problem. \nI would say that I think one of the things we ought to consider \ndoing, is to examine the bill.\n    I say to Ms. Long and Mr. Burnham, that in the bill that \npassed out of committee, Section 3709, I believe, helps Section \n1103, which is a new section, the independent IG for Tax \nAdministration will help. Then Section 3503 deals with \nexamination data and I asked earlier Ms. Long and Mr. Burnham \nto examine that to make sure we have that language right."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Good."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    We may want, Mr. Chairman, to look at the \npossibility of putting language into Section 1101, which is the \nduties of the new Oversight Board. I mean, all of us understand \nthat you get different interpretations of data.\n    If I am presenting data to you I may want to skew it in my \nfavor. I may want to say I am taller, I do not weigh as much, I \nam younger than I look. I mean, we skew data to our benefit. I \nam a lot faster than I look, and so forth.\n    So we understand that data can sometimes get skewed as a \nresult of my desire to impress you, but that is not what we are \ntalking about here. We are talking about just the availability \nof reliable data that IRS says they agree it is good, we agree \nit is good.\n    It may be, Mr. Chairman, and I would say, Senator Moynihan, \nin your longstanding interest in getting good data from \ngovernment, maybe we ought to look at putting some language \ninto 1101 that would make certain that this committee is \ngetting, and the public is getting, the kind of data that they \nneed to make certain that the best oversight of all in \nrepresentative democracy occurs, which is the public's ability \nto get the information, and we then respond to that information \nas it is being analyzed by the public.\n    Now, Ms. Long actually has a permanent injunction right \nnow. She went through a lengthy Freedom of Information Act \nprocess in order to get the examination data. It is a \nremarkable story all by itself, and indicates why we need to \nchange the law so that the public, and we as their \nrepresentatives, can try to figure out what is right and what \nis wrong.\n    The Chairman. Well, I think we all agree that accurate \ninformation is essential to effective oversight, so we will be \nglad to work with you on that, Senator Kerrey.\n    I just want to again express my thanks to both of you for \nbeing here today. It is very helpful to have available the kind \nof information you accumulate and investigate. It gives us a \ngreat deal of help. I just want to publicly say how indebted we \nare to both of you for the excellence of your work.\n    Thank you very much.\n    Mr. Burnham. Thank you very much.\n    Ms. Long. Thank you very much."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Mr. Chairman, if I may just, on an \natavistic attachment to Syracuse University, note that this \nyear in the U.S. News and World Report, I believe, they listed \nthe 20 best universities for the study of public administration \nin the Nation, and Syracuse was number one.

"","","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","STATEMENT OF MAUREEN O'DWYER, INTERNATIONAL EXAMINER, MANHATTAN \n               DISTRICT, INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE"
break,break,break,break
"","","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Ms. O'Dwyer. Thank you. Mr. Chairman and distinguished \nmembers of the committee, I am a grade 13 International \nExaminer in the Manhattan District of the Internal Revenue \nService. I joined the service in March 1987 as a grade 7 \nExaminer. My college studies were in mathematics, economics, \nand accounting. Prior to that, I was involved in art.\n    Within the service, I progressed from the office \nexamination of simple Form 1040's to the field examination of \nsmall business Schedule Cs and Form 1120's through to large \ncase, CEP, examination, and ultimately to the audit of \ninternational corporations. I have been in International for 7 \nyears.\n    In the past, I have received awards, and have also written \nan audit technique for the service.\n    When first approached to give testimony before you, I was \nreluctant to do so, as I considered it to be a betrayal of my \nfellow employees. The IRS is an easy smear. And it has been \nreviled, both justly and unjustly, in the press. From the \ninside looking out, it is easy to distinguish between which \naccusations are true and which are not. No one has risen to the \ndefense of the service against the unjust accusations. I did \nnot wish to add more fuel to the already raging fire or further \ndemoralize my fellow employees by disclosing any other \ninequitable practices of the service.\n    But our system of taxation is dependent on the taxpayer's \nbelief that the tax laws they follow will apply to everyone and \nin the belief that they will be administered impartially. I \nobserved that this impartiality does not exist--does not \nhappen.\n    Therefore, my sense of righteous indignation at the \nbetrayal of the fiduciary trust of the American public by the \nservice outweighed any personal concern that my testimony would \ndisplay a lack of loyalty toward the service. It is the average \nAmerican citizen who is my employer. And it is this citizen to \nwhom I am beholden, not the service nor its administrators nor \nmy fellow employees.\n    Thus, I am here today to discuss the uneven enforcement of \nthe Internal Revenue Service Code and Regulations by order of \nsome Internal Revenue Service managers and administrators. I am \nalso going to explain the reasons that the service does this \nand the devastating affect that it has on the morale and the \nsense of morality of its employees.\n    My discussion begins with the case of my recent past. The \ntaxpayer was a sophisticated, international corporation, well-\nschooled in international and tax law. My examination of this \ntaxpayer led me to believe that it had aggressively pursued tax \navoidance.\n    I had orally proposed adjustments to this taxpayer on \nissues which involved transfer pricing, reorganizations, \nmergers, and consolidations. The dollar amount of my proposals \nwere in excess of $42 million and had tax effects in excess of \n$12 million. Penalties and interest could double the tax effect \nto over $24 million.\n    The taxpayer had agreed on the issues proposed, but was \nnegotiating as to the numbers and was preparing a pricing \nstudy. My manager after reviewing the case asked me to call the \ntaxpayer and get a response date from their on their pricing \nstudy. The taxpayer requested two more weeks. The two-week \nextension was given.\n    The following day a memorandum listing overage cases was \ncirculated by the International District Program Manager. My \ncase was on that list.\n    When my manager received the memorandum on overage cases, \nhe called me into his office and ordered me to immediately no-\nchange the case. He said it was not necessary to write an \ninternational examiner's report. He ordered me to purge my work \npapers, to simply hand in the tax return stamped no-change. \nTherefore, there will be no record of any audit work on the \nissues considered in this case.\n    He informed me that he had the absolute authority to do \nthis and that he had the full support of his branch chief in so \ndoing and that if I did not do this that I would be held as \ninsubordinate. It was only when I threatened to go to \ninspection about being ordered to purge my work papers that I \nwas allowed to hand them in and write ``the international \nexaminer's report, no-change as ordered''.\n    I was not, however, even granted the two weeks promised to \nthe taxpayer in an attempt to close the case agreed. Nor was I \nallowed to write the case up as unagreed in an attempt to \nprotect the revenue base of the service.\n    That this was an egregious and capricious misuse of \nauthority by my manager can be seen by the fact that an \ninternational examiner's report is always written up in the \nsame format. It takes no great or lesser amount of time to \nwrite a case unagreed, agreed, or no-change.\n    All the time I spent developing the issues was wasted. The \nmanager violated the mission of the service to collect the \nproper amount of the tax revenue at the least cost.\n    In that report, I wrote of the issues of the taxpayer's \ncounter proposal and of the order by my manager to no-change \nthe case.\n    Administrators and managers, while they bear the ultimate \nresponsibility for the disposition of cases which are worked by \nexaminers who are under their supervision, do not have \nunqualified authority. This means that there must be a sound \nand legal basis for the disposition of all taxpayer cases.\n    These administrators are not granted such absolute \nauthority as they usurp, either through position descriptions \nor under the Internal Revenue Manual. They are sworn in as \nservants of the public to uphold the law.\n    The Assistant District Program Manager International keeps \na file of these reports on closed cases. My file on that case \nis missing. It was removed because the case was closed no-\nchange without basis in tax law and proper IRS procedure and \nwhen a taxpayer was agreeing. And that report contained my \nprotest.\n    If that report was ever accessed under the Freedom of \nInformation Act and the information on that action got out, the \nIRS would be badly embarrassed. The only defense of the IRS for \nits action of no-change would be poor audit techniques and lack \nof issue development by the examiner. This the IRS could not \ndo. Not only because it was not so, but because of the tax \nsophistication of the taxpayer that was agreeing.\n    This decision by my manager to no-change the case was based \non his desire for advancement in the Manhattan District. The \nManhattan District was and still is statistics driven. The \ndistrict is very self conscious about having the oldest cases \nin the service. And its administration continually monitors the \nstatistics, not the issues on aging cases.\n    A manager who has an aging case in his group will not \nreceive an evaluation that will merit him a monetary award and \nhelp him carve out a career path within the service.\n    When my manager no-changed that case, he betrayed the trust \nand confidence of the American people and his own sworn duty to \nperform in a matter warranting the highest degree of public \nconfidence in his integrity, efficiency, and fairness. My \nmanager through ambition, incompetence, and lack of integrity \ngave up a potential tax deficiency which could have brought in \nas much revenue as $24 million in exchange for his vain hope of \na monetary award in the amount of $2,000.\n    There are managers in the Manhattan District who hold their \nintegrity in higher esteem than their careers and who will \nargue for the merits of issues on such cases. These are usually \nthe more intelligent and technically competent managers.\n    Throughout the Manhattan District, the technically weaker \nmanagers consistently ordered cases closed, no-change as they \nbegin to age. In large case, CEP, it is standard practice to \ndrop an issue that will delay the closing of the case. Large \ndollar amounts on major taxpayers are routinely zeroed out in \nthis manner.\n    It matters not that there appears to be an egregious tax \nabuse nor that the complexity of the issue requires time to \ndevelop. What matters is the manager receive a performance \naward for having met the case-closing deadline timely.\n    When questioned as to why the issue was dropped, a \npraiseworthy although obfuscating answer that is often given in \nresponse is, it was good taxpayer relations.\n    I am cognizant that there are cases which should be no-\nchanged because there are no issues. However, this recognition \nthat there is no issue and the decision to no-change a case is \none that is made early in the audit cycle.\n    The cases that begin to age ordinarily have outstanding \nissues which have gone unresolved due to the complexity of the \nissues involved and the difficulty of their development or due \nto the deliberate procrastination and lack of cooperation on \nthe part of the taxpayer.\n    Therefore, it can be seen that the cases which are closed \nno-change under the statistically-driven cosmetic deadline are \nusually large and wealthy taxpayers who have the means to \nconsistently contend and dispute with the IRS.\n    The Internal Revenue Service has often expressed the \nconcern that an adjustment would bankrupt Wall Street, but it \nhas never expressed any concern about bankrupting Main Street.\n    I am personally aware of similar cases handled by other \nmanagers in the same manner can verify the above statements. \nDue to time constraints, I cannot describe them all.\n    However, I would like to recount just one case. The \nexaminer in this case had proposed a unique and seldom-\nconsidered adjustment in international. The adjustment placed a \nspecial tax on the foreign shareholders of an American \ncorporation. The examiner had researched the foreign tax treaty \napplicable to the foreign shareholders and found no exemption \nto the tax. The adjustment was strictly statutory, highly \ntechnical, and ordinarily placed only against American \nshareholders.\n    Even the taxpayer's highly qualified and highly paid \nrepresentative agreed that it was a viable issue. But because \nthere was no case law on point for the application of this \nissue to foreign shareholders, the representative requested \nthat the examiner secure a tech advice from Washington counsel \nin order to clarify and resolve the issue.\n    To do so would age the case. Therefore, the examiner's \nmanager ordered the case closed no-change. The amount of tax \nrevenue given up by this malfunctioning manager was about \n$500,000. And if an audit was extended to the later years, as \nis required by the Internal Revenue Manual, the amount of tax \nrevenue would probably have been over $1 million.\n    But all taxpayers are not treated to a no-change by a \nmanager as a case ages. The aging returns of small taxpayers \nare written up unagreed and penalties are assessed. The \ntaxpayer will receive a stat notice, that is it must respond \nwithin 90 days. If the taxpayer does not respond within this \ntimeframe, it will automatically lose its appeals right and the \nright to petition Tax Court.\n    Understanding these procedures is difficult for the \nunknowledgeable small taxpayer. Without representation, the \nsmall taxpayer is vulnerable. The results can be costly.\n    Stat notices are routinely done to small taxpayers through \nservice centers in correspondence audits and through agents in \nfield and office exam. The service does this because it has \nover loaded the working inventory of examiners in order to pump \nup closed-case statistics.\n    While this may be an example of what drives the IRS, \nperhaps a more defining example of what drives a career \nmotivated IRS administrator is an account of how two similar \ntax cases were handled by one manager.\n    The examiner under the manager on both tax cases was the \nsame. Unreported income and/or false deductions which would \nincur a fraud penalty had been found in succeeding years on \nboth tax cases by the examiner.\n    Both taxpayers were professionals. The first taxpayer was \nvery cooperative. He went through alone represented by neither \nan accountant nor lawyer.\n    When it became apparent that there would be unreported \nincome, the examiner asked him to bring in his accountant. The \nman declined. He was embarrassed and could not bear to have his \naccountant think that he had these charges leveled against him \nby the IRS.\n    His tax deficiency without penalties for 2 years was about \n$45,000. With interest and penalties, especially the civil \nfraud penalty, this amount increased to over $100,000. The man \nhad no bank account and no assets other than his cooperative \napartment which he was arranging to sell in order to pay for \nthis IRS assessment.\n    The examiner asked the manager to remove the fraud penalty, \nexplaining that although this man could not substantiate all of \nthe money which passed through his bank account, the audit \nrevealed that the man had sold some possessions and that he had \nreceived the return of some money which he had lent to friends. \nBoth of these accounted for some, but not all of the unearned \nincome deposited in his account.\n    Perhaps, a more comprehensive investigation would find \nadequate explanations for the balance of the unreported income.\n    The examiner also explained that if this man had \nrepresentation, refused to agree, and his case went to appeal, \nthat the civil fraud penalty would probably not be upheld. \nDeliberate intent would be difficult to prove, especially when \nassessing the character of this man.\n    During the audit years, the man had successfully raised two \nchildren as a single parent, paid for medical expenses of \nfriends who could not afford to do so, and had altruistically \ndonated money to impersonal charities without thought of any \npersonal gain. The manager simply responded, no, he's guilty. \nThis taxpayer without an advocate was callously condemned.\n    The other taxpayer never appeared for the audit. He was \nrepresented by a CPA attorney and also by a former IRS Criminal \nInvestigation Division employee.\n    The previous 3 years of this taxpayer's return had been \naudited by another examiner. The taxpayer had agreed to the \ndisallowance of personal items which he had deducted on those \nreturns.\n    Both of his representatives were uncooperative, cited IRS \nharassment of their client, procrastinated, held back \ninformation, and consistently attempted to intimidate the \nexaminer.\n    Despite this, the examiner persisted and found \nsubstantially large deductions that were false, as well as the \nsame personal deductions that had been disallowed in the \nprevious 3-year audit.\n    The deficiency not including penalties for this taxpayer \nwas $450,000. With civil fraud and other penalties as well as \ninterest, it would be over $1 million.\n    The moment the examiner found these false deductions, the \nrepresentatives changed their approach to the audit. Formerly \nhostile and aggressive, they now whimpered and became \nnauseatingly friendly.\n    They cited the prestige of the taxpayer and the \nrepresentative in the community and the meaning of their \nrespective positions to the community, but they offered no \nexplanation of the falsification and the repeated taking of \npersonal deductions which had been previously disallowed.\n    The examiner, on the other hand, the education and \nknowledge of the taxpayer, the contempt he displayed for the \nlaw by taking personal deductions that he knew were wrong.\n    In comparison to the first taxpayer, this man considerably \nmore wealthy lived off his tax return. He deducted his designer \ncloths, the wages paid to his housekeeper, the furnishings and \nrent of his personal apartment as well as trips abroad for both \nhim and his father. His charitable donations were to \nfoundations in his own industry, always bearing his own name, \nand designed to enhance his career.\n    An examiner has no authority to remove a penalty. A manager \ndoes under certain conditions. When exhorted by the \nrepresentative simply to be understanding and give a little to \nthis taxpayer, the manager without hesitation removed the fraud \npenalty. When asked by the examiner why----"
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Mr. Chairman, could I respectfully ask a \nquestion at this point?\n    The Chairman. Yes."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    There are two points, sir. And we know \nthe respect and affection you are held by this committee on \nboth sides. But our rules specifically require that testimony \nbe distributed to members of the committee at noon day."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    At noon of the business day immediately \nbefore the last business day."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Noon of the business day immediately \nbeforehand. And in all these hearings, we have never seen \ntestimony. It is handed out to us at the moment it begins, the \nwitnesses appear. And then, it says ``having submitted his \nwritten testimony, the witness shall be allowed not more than \n10 minutes for oral presentation of his statement''.\n    Now, we gathered here at 9:30. It is now 10:00 o'clock. And \nMrs. O'Dwyer is still going on about people who are \nnauseatingly friendly having been whimpering and such. We do \nhave rules, sir. And can we not keep to a 10-minute rule? And \ncould we hope that in order to ask so we can join in this? This \nlegislation is coming out of this committee unanimously. And we \nwant to keep it that way, but the staff is just not being very \nhelpful. Could I ask my colleagues?\n    Senator Kerrey, would you?"
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Yes, sir. I mean, not only do we have rules \ngoverning this committee and if there is going to be changes in \nthe rules, we should vote on it. I mean, I am willing to \naccommodate concerns that the witnesses might have for \nintimidation by the IRS if that is the concern."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Sure."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    But that concern should be brought to the \nfull committee. And we should vote to make an exception to the \nrules. I mean, we set the rules. Furthermore, there are \nstanding rules of the Senate that govern the conduct of the \ncommittee. And that also makes clear that this testimony needs \nto be made available to everybody on the committee.\n    The Chairman. Well, first of all, let me point out that in \nmost cases, we rarely have in advance the testimony of \nadministrative witnesses."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    It has been known to happen, yes, sir.\n    The Chairman. And before. So that this is a practice that \nhas become the general practice rather than the exception.\n    The Chairman let me point out here that one of the reasons \nwe withheld this information is because frankly the witnesses \nneeded to be protected. I think it would be a serious mistake \nto try to delay these hearings.\n    We have a number of distinguished members of the IRS who at \ngreat personal risk are coming before us to testify what they \nhave seen as long-time employees.\n    And I think it is critically important that this is not a \nmatter of being critical of this administration or any other \nadministration. As a matter of fact, many of the examples that \nare used took place under other administrations."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Oh, clearly, we have never suggested for \na moment that this administration or any particular \nadministration.\n    The Chairman. I would hope that we would agree that these \nwitnesses who are here today, who have come here at tremendous \npersonal risk and are worried about retaliation, to be \nperfectly honest, they have an opportunity to tell their \nexperiences as they see them.\n    I would remind you these are current witnesses and they are \nunder oath. I think it is important that the facts be brought \nout."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Mr. Chairman, I do as well. I would point \nout merely that prior to the enactment of the Taxpayer Bill of \nRights 1 and Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2 that Senator Grassley \nand Senator Pryor were so much involved with, there were \nsimilar sorts of hearings. And I would ask Senator Grassley in \nthe previous moments when we had other witnesses. We have had \nother IRS employees before the committee at previous times \nprior to the enactment of those two pieces of legislation.\n    I mean, we are basically enacting Taxpayer Bill of Rights 3 \nas Title III of this bill. And the only reason I want--I do not \nwant to stop the witness from testifying. I want to make \ncertain that they are protected against any kind of retaliation \nor intimidation that might occur against them.\n    But the question before us is how should we write this new \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights 3? And my presumption would be that \nwhen Senator Pryor and Senator Grassley had their hearings that \nthey distributed testimony and they followed the rules of both \nthe Senate and the committee."
"baucus","Senator Baucus","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Senator Baucus."
"baucus","Senator Baucus","baucus","Senator Baucus","    Mr. Chairman, there are really two issues \nhere. One is protection of the taxpayers, that is the witnesses \nin particular which we all do want to do. And the other issue \nis the degree to which these are going to be informative \nhearings where we as a committee get to the bottom of the \nmatter and find some ways to minimize the recurrence of the \nallegations.\n    Now, the rules, our committee rules are designed to \naccomplish both objectives. In the first place, the notice. \nRegrettably, none of us, except for the chairman and maybe \nother staff or other people, certainly no Democratic Senators \nor Democratic staff had any idea of who you are, who you were \ngoing to be until we walked in here.\n    We did not know what your testimony would be. We did not \nknow who you are. We had no idea which makes it a little bit \ndifficult to prepare. It makes it difficult for us to kind of \nwork to get to the bottom of the matter, that is work on your \ntestimony and try to find out what constructively is going on \nhere, not engage in the theatrics or demagoguery, but rather \njust constructively find out what is going on here.\n    So that is why we have the requirement and the rules that \nthe testimony be submitted a day in advance, by noon a day in \nadvance presumably so that members of the committee and their \nstaffs can look at the testimony and ask intelligent questions.\n    It is much more difficult to ask intelligent questions the \nfirst time we have seen you or know of you or seen your \ntestimony as the moment we walked in here. That is just no way \nto conduct business. That is why the rules were written that \nway I think, Mr. Chairman.\n    With respect to protection of the witnesses, there are ways \nwe can do that. We can have redacted testimony. We can meet in \nexecutive session, Mr. Chairman. I mean, we can have the \nwitnesses tell us their problems and what they faced with the \nIRS in executive session, not in public. That is another way to \nprotect the witnesses. Already have another hearing afterwards, \nafter we have had the executive session hearing.\n    That is what we do in the Intelligence Committee, as the \nSenator from Nebraska knows who is the Vice Chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee. We have many hearings in executive \nsession, closed sessions dealing with intelligence. Then, we \noften have another open hearing on the same subject, but not \ngoing into classified information because I think the public \nhas a right to know what generally we are doing and what is \ngoing on.\n    So, Mr. Chairman, I urge you to find some way to minimize \nthe politics of this. And I will be honest with you, this is \ngetting political because our side has no idea what is going on \nhere.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. Mr. Chairman."
"baucus","Senator Baucus","baucus","Senator Baucus","    No idea whatsoever. And in addition try to \ndo it in a way that does protect the witnesses. As I said, \nexecutive session of one way. Redacting their testimony is \nanother way, but at least find some way other than the current \nroad we are going down which I think is not doing the public a \ngood service.\n    The Chairman. Well, just let me make a couple of \nobservations. Then, I will call on you. As I mentioned, this \nparticular rule has more often not been followed. Frankly, as \nyou well know, in the majority of cases, the agencies, from the \nAdministration, have not submitted their testimony. And nobody, \nbut nobody has made any objections to me on that score in the \npast. This is the first time this has happened.\n    Secondly, as I just mentioned, these hearings are not \npartisan. Many of the situations and cases happened under other \nadministrations. What we are looking at is to try to make \nchanges in an agency that has some practices that are not in \nthe best interest of the taxpayer.\n    As far as going behind closed doors, as we know, we have \nsunshine legislation. And the general rule is that these \nmatters should be discussed in public. The public is entitled \nto know.\n    The reason in this particular case the testimony was not \nsubmitted earlier was frankly to protect the witnesses, who are \ncurrent employees. As they will testify, they are very \nconcerned about retaliation.\n    We are not in any way trying to indict the administration. \nAs a matter of fact, I have said time and again that we applaud \nthe appointment of the new Commissioner. We think he is an \noutstanding man. We have been trying to work very closely with \nhim, and we will continue to do so. But in the meantime, I \nthink it is important to get the facts out.\n    Again, I emphasize that each of these witnesses are long-\ntime employees. They are under oath. And it seems to me that it \nis important that the public hear what they have to say.\n    Now, Senator Moseley-Braun.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As you \nknow, particularly going through these hearings, there is has \nbeen no member on this committee that has been more concerned \nabout retribution against IRS employees than I. We had the \nconversation yesterday with the majority leader. This is a \nmatter of real concern I think on both sides of the aisle for \nall members of this committee to make sure that these people \nwho have the courage to come forward are protected.\n    Having said that, it just happens, Mr. Chairman, that I am \nsitting here. I have with me a history of the Committee on \nFinance. I do not know. I think this was authorized when Robert \nDole was the chairman of this committee. But in any event, it \nhas been made available. And I have decided that as the first \nwoman on the committee, I would read the history of the \nCommittee on Finance.\n    What this book makes very clear is that this committee has \na tradition of bipartisanship. This committee has a tradition \nof people working together without regard to partisan lines and \nthat Democratic members are treated as well as Republican \nmembers, that the rules are followed without regard to what \nparty you belong to on this committee, and that there is a \nsharing of the leadership between the chairman and the minority \nparty spokesman.\n    No one wants to not have sunshine on this process. \nEverybody wants to have sunshine. Everybody wants to hear from \nthese witnesses.\n    But I would just urge the chairman and the members to \nlisten closely to what Senator Moynihan had to say because if \nanything, he was raising I think an issue in the tradition of \nthis Finance Committee which is that we have rules and that \nthose rules are equally applied and that we all, all of us have \nequal access to the information.\n    And I probably should have mentioned the majority leader's \nname because now I have inspired him to want to say something, \nbut in any event I can tell. Oh, boy, did I punch a button.\n    Of all the committees, we should not let this committee \ndevolve or get diminished into any kind of partisanship. That \nis not in keeping with the tradition of the Finance Committee.\n    The Chairman. Senator Gramm.\n    Senator Gramm. Well, Mr. Chairman, let me yield to Senator \nLott. And then, if you will come back to me."
"lott","Senator Lott","baucus","Senator Baucus","    I will be brief. Are we listening to \nourselves here? We are talking about a rule. I did not see this \ntestimony, but I am real interested in what these three ladies \nand this gentleman have to say. For 15 minutes now, we have \nbeen arguing over two rules. We want to cut this lady off.\n    I would like to ask the witnesses to try to limit \nthemselves to 10 minutes. But I really think in a bipartisan \nway, we ought to listen to what this panel has to say."

"","","","","    [Applause.]"
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","lott","Senator Lott","    Mr. Chairman, may we have order? What is \nthat in the back? And just that I agree with the majority \nleader. And he agrees with us. If we had read this testimony \novernight, we would know more about it, but let us hear it.\n    And may I say to Ms. O'Dwyer that if you feel under any \nthreat to your life or position, you have the senior Senator \nfrom New York State here to say that it will not happen.\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. Thank you.\n    Senator Grassley. The trouble is the senior Senator from \nNew York or the senior Senator from Iowa in the case of Des \nMoines, we cannot be with these people enough to really protect \nthem from harassment."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    They have our phone numbers.\n    Senator Grassley. Well, I know it. And I know you are \nsincere, Senator Moynihan. And I know you will do what you can.\n    But these people are here. I think that we are worried \nabout ourselves as political leaders, maybe following a rule or \nnot following a rule, the extraordinary circumstances under \nwhich these people are here. And they are ruining their lives \nas a result of being here. They are no longer going to be able \nto function in the IRS the way we know the IRS. And we do not \neven know it as well as they do.\n    And I think we ought to have some sympathy for the people \nthat are before us rather than worrying about our own \nprerogatives. I think it is pretty selfish of us when these \npeople are sacrificing. We are not sacrificing one doggoned \nthing by sitting here and listening to them. But it is sure \nevident that the Congress has not been doing its job for the \nlast 20 years or we would not even have these people here.\n    The Chairman. Well, I suggest that we move ahead and hear \nthese individuals. I would say, for example, in Mrs. O'Dwyer's \ncase, we initially asked her to limit her testimony to 10 \nminutes. She felt very strongly that she had an important story \nto tell that would take longer. And so we agreed with that."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    All right. I am fine with that.\n    The Chairman. Please proceed, Mrs. O'Dwyer.\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. Thank you. When asked by the examiner why he \nremoved it, this was when the manager removed a fraud penalty, \nthe manager's response was, ``if I didn't, the representative \nwould lose him as a client.''\n    Why such an astounding and perverted response from an IRS \nmanager? Because this was a manager who was always looking for \na tax appointment outside the service. By this decision, he \nbonded a network with two men he saw as wealthy and powerful \nand in a position to recommend him for some future job opening.\n    This manager stands not alone in his behavior. Other even \nmore senior level administrations and executives do the same, \ntheir agenda and introduction into the business world. They \nnetwork and make friends in preparation for careers outside the \nservice. Their sense of morality has been eclipsed by their \npersonal ambition.\n    Many administrators have known IRS projects to be a waste \nof time and of resources immediately after the inception of \nthese projects. As those administrators were responsible for \nthese projects, the projects were pushed forward anyway because \nthey were tax trendy or because they would bring favorable \npublicity to the IRS and thus to the career of the project \nadministrator.\n    One such project was so highly visible and trendy that it \npropelled the administrator out of the service and into a \nlucrative position.\n    Another project had good public relations value. A senior-\nlevel administrator placed a lower level administrator in \ncharge of that project and requested a follow-up report on the \nproject. The lower administrator told the senior administrator \nthat the project was useless and should be abandoned because \nthe project could not achieve the goals that were expected of \nit. As the project had good public relations value, the senior \nofficial told the lower official to expand the project and to \nwrite it up as worthwhile.\n    I especially mention this in order to make the public aware \nthat many pronouncements made by the IRS are simply not true. \nThe service deliberately disseminates false information.\n    An examiner complained to me about the handling of his case \nby an IRS expert. Two issues had existed in the examiner's tax \ncase. One issue was entirely technical in nature. The taxpayer \nhad conceded this issue. The other issue fell into a gray area \nthat came under the umbrella of this man's expertise.\n    As is the custom within the service, the expert was asked \nto attend the closing conference on the case with the examiner \nand his manager. The expert took over the case completely, \ntreating the examiner and his manager as bystanders.\n    The expert relinquished the technical adjustment not within \nhis province which had been conceded to by the taxpayer. He \nthen reduced his own adjustment to a diminimus amount. He told \nthe examiner and the manager that this was necessary in order \nto get an agreed case. Actually, this man needed his issue \nagreed in order to proof the worth of his expertise.\n    The taxpayer's prominent lawyer was delighted. The examiner \nand his manager were outraged, vowing to never again invite the \nexpert to a closing conference. That evening as the examiner \nstood near a fax machine, he saw a fax come in for the expert. \nIt came from the prominent lawyer in the prominent law firm \npraising the IRS expert for his excellent expertise and invited \nthe IRS expert to speak at a prominent legal association. Weak \negos in need of acclaim are sometimes the cause of moral \ndeficiency.\n    When people, such as these experts, commissioners, district \ndirectors, executives, and lawyers leave the service, they \nreturn as representatives of major taxpayers and ignore the \nethical mandate of the service that former employees disqualify \nthemselves for a 2-year period from representing any taxpayer \nwhose cases were open and under their authority while they were \nemployed by the service.\n    They seek to intimidate examiners by asserting their former \nprestige and their still current contacts within the service. \nThey endeavor to call in markers to influence the people whom \nthey have promoted and those who they used to manage in order \nto make the adjustments just go away.\n    A former district director employed by a major accounting \nfirm shamelessly solicited work from other accounting firms \nciting his influence within the service. They bypass the \nexaminer and attempt to conduct the audit through a manager or \na more senior-level administrator.\n    An audit is conducted by an examiner. Hence, the title \nexaminer. Their purpose is to seize control of the examination \nin order to negotiate a settlement before the audit even \nbegins. They exert tremendous pressure to drop significant \nitems on the return and to convert an adjustment which would \nhave substantial tax effect into an adjustment with no tax \neffect.\n    These former administrators obstruct the path of the audit \nand never respond to much of the requests for information. They \nwhisper those magical words, time on a case, months in process, \ndollar yield, good taxpayer relations which they have heard and \nused so often in their former careers into the ears of the \nservice administrators.\n    These remarkable subliminal prompters are so effective that \nunwarranted settlements are made. Vowing to the pressure of a \nrepresentative, a manager reassigned a case that had been \nclosed and agreed for processing. It was reassigned to a junior \nexaminer to be reworked in order to ensure the flow of the \naudit toward the position of the representative, an adjustment \nof only $2 million.\n    The case had been closed, unagreed with the stamp of \napproval of Washington counsel. It is the policy of the service \nnever to reassign and rework the case except when the case has \nbeen left incomplete due to the resignation or reassignment of \nthe examiner.\n    As the lead into my next section, I have been asked to \nexpress the sentiments of a revenue officer in the Manhattan \nDistrict Collection Division. He was to appear before you \ntoday. That fear of losing his job caused him not to appear \ngives witness to the magnitude of retaliation that is imposed \nby the service upon the outspoken.\n    Again, as time limits his story, I include only his most \npoignant testimony. This collection officer had written off as \nuncollectible two taxpayer accounts. His manager threatened \ndisciplinary action against the employee if he refused to levy \nthese two taxpayers as ordered.\n    On Christmas day, this manager brutally forced the \ncollection officer to levy the salary of one taxpayer who was \nearning subsistence wages.\n    The second taxpayer was dying of cancer, was living on \nwelfare. Even though internal documents informed the IRS that \nthis man was a welfare recipient, the collection officer was \nordered by his manager to have the terminally ill and \nimpoverished taxpayer provide the service with a written \nstatement and supporting documentation that would verify his \nfinancial condition and his illness.\n    The collection officer was also instructed to make a count \nof in order to seize any and all assets that belonged to this \nsick taxpayer.\n    What would the IRS do with $50 from a piggy bank? Was it \nreally necessary for big brother to levy on Christmas eve? \nCould it not wait until after Christmas eve?\n    What was the ultimate disposition by the service of these \ntwo taxpayer accounts? They were declared uncollectible and \nwritten off. A tremendous amount of service resources had been \nutilized, time had been wasted, two taxpayers were preyed upon, \none employee was demoralized, all on the order of management in \nits attempt to achieve an improperly measured productivity \nstatistics. Before ever there is a taxpayer victim, there is \nfirst an employee victim.\n    If either of these taxpayers had had the wherewithal to \nhave filed a complaint or had the actions of the collection \nofficer somehow become public, management would have declared \nthem the actions of a rogue employee. Not so.\n    Incidents such as these occur over and over again, both in \ncollection and in examination. The employee is intimidated and \ncoerced into submission to the misused authority of \nadministrators with the resulting inequitable actions that harm \ntaxpayers.\n    While government agencies, such as the Internal Revenue \nService should be held to standards of efficiency for \nproductivity, the service can never be measured by the same \nstandards as for-profit businesses.\n    Statistics as they are used by the Internal Revenue Service \nto measure productivity can never be correct. Productivity on \ncases must be measured by the complexity of the issues \ninvolved, the complexity and cooperation of the taxpayer as \nwell as other mitigating circumstances.\n    However, the service as a number-oriented organization will \nalways regress to the safety and rigidity of statistics. Right \nnow within the service, as statistics and dollar yield are \ndisappearing, other statistics on months in process, hours per \ncase, and filed time versus office time are emerging to replace \nthem. These statistics are directly ordered by Washington and \nremanded to local districts as record keeping for enforcement.\n    Within the IRS, the power of the chain of command, line \nauthority prevails. The pressure on lower-level administrators \nto achieve these administratively imposed statistical goals is \noverwhelming.\n    Special emphasis is placed on blind obedience prompted by \nthe desire for successful careers, administrators on each \nsucceeding lower level will yield. The service acknowledges and \nrewards deference to line authority, not deference to moral \nauthority.\n    Goals must be reached. Statistics are massaged. A senior \nlevel administrator will order the justified penalties of a \nmajor delinquent taxpayer removed in order to get the case \nquickly agreed and closed into the statistics of the current \nquarter.\n    The revenue received from the deficiency was needed to \nincrease the current dollar yield of the district. Another \nadministrator will order in 5,000 cases which are known to have \npoor tax potential in order to plump productivity statistics.\n    There are other administrators who will not condone such \nbehavior, but they cannot openly condemn it. Instead, they turn \nsilently away, seeing nothing, hearing nothing, knowing \nnothing.\n    Reluctant to become the target of their powerful brethren, \nthese timid administrators close ranks to form a wall of \nprotection around the more mighty. This policy of containment \ncreates a culture of deceit.\n    I once asked a branch chief why he had lied about a trivial \nmatter concerning upper management policy. This was only after \nthe branch chief had been exposed in the lie. He responded that \nit was his program to form a buffer between baseline employees. \nProblems must never go up. Policy must never come down. In \nother words, correct information is never transmitted upward or \ndownward. And truth is never free to flow in any direction.\n    Loyal but inept employees will be protected and even \npromoted. Critical but effective employees risk harassment, \ndemotion, and dismissal. Character assassination on these \noutspoken employees is normal. Other employees who participate \nin the attack on the outspoken employee will be rewarded a \ncoveted assignment, a promotion.\n    Management has the tools and the power to get what it \nwishes. The outspoken employee will be ostracized and attacked \non all fronts. If his integrity cannot be impugned, every \neffort will be made to destroy his work product.\n    Recourse to the offices of inspection or EEO for that \nemployee are useless. Both agencies seldom act independently \nfrom but rather as arms of the service administrators.\n    If acts of alleged physical menace were charged in two \nseparate instances, one incident between two bargaining unit \nemployees and the other incident where a bargaining unit \nemployee was allegedly the victim of an administrator, \ninspection will not investigate the incident where the charges \nwere alleged against the administrator. It will investigate \nalleged charges brought against the bargaining unit employee in \nthe other incident.\n    If an EEO complaint is brought either against an outspoken \nemployee or by an outspoken employee, administration will get \ninvolved to the detriment of the outspoken employee. Strong \nefforts will be made by management to imply that the outspoken \nemployee is the offending party.\n    If the EEO complaint was leveled against the outspoken \nemployee, management will immediately reassign the outspoken \nemployee, sending out an implied signal there is truth to the \ncharges leveled against the employee.\n    When an EEO complaint is brought by an outspoken employee \nagainst a supervisor, it is usually because that supervisor has \nbeen harassing and derogating the employee for being outspoken.\n    Management will make every effort to hinder, impede, and \ndeep six the charges. The charged employee will receive visible \nsympathy and be given career enhancing assignments, implying \nhis innocence. There could be no relief to the employee victim \nof IRS harassment except to step into Federal court.\n    If the employee is not strong enough to fight retaliation \nof victimization, the consequences can be dire: dismissal, \nalcoholism, and even death.\n    A manager placed a mocking poster of a moronic character on \nhis wall which had a crude title. Onto this poster, the manager \nplaced the name of an employee whom he disliked because he was \nvocal. The manager went undisciplined. The employee so degraded \nand vilified died of a heart attack.\n    Within the Manhattan District, there has even been a \nsuicide by a bargaining unit employee as a result of harassment \nby management.\n    A dual standard is used in disciplining management \nemployees and bargaining unit employees with similar breaches \nof the rules of conduct. A joint IRS-NTEU study concluded that \nbargaining unit minority employees routinely receive harsher \ndiscipline for minor infractions of the rules of conduct.\n    A Manhattan District administrator publicly embarrassed the \nservice when arrested for violation of a civil statute. The \narrest was splashed across the media. The behavior of this \nadministrator was an enormous breach of the rules of conduct \nfor not satisfying in good faith obligations, including all \njust financial obligations that are imposed by law. That \nadministrator was never discharged and is now in a superior \nposition.\n    A bargaining unit employee would have dismissed if his \nsalary was garnished and not sent on a career enhancing detail \nto a superior position, as was another Manhattan District \nexecutive employee.\n    In the milieu that I have described, is it not easier for \nan employee to abandon critical thought, relinquish sound \nreasoning, suspend ethical judgment, and surrender to the lie? \nWithin the IRS work force, as splendid talents lie dormant, \nnovocained by the outrages of management, Stepford employees \nare arising.\n    When the service is caught in unethical acts, public \napologies will be made and lip service given to new principles \nand concepts, but the service is incapable of understanding and \nabsorbing any principle or concept that cannot be reduced to a \nstatistic, a number, or a digit.\n    Management needs to be rehabilitated. A channel must be put \nin place that will ensure that the old bureaucracy and its old \nideas are swept aside.\n    Risks must be taken for the issue oriented creativity to \nendure. If not, always there will coexist customer taxpayer \nvictims and employee victims. And there will continue a run on \nthe moral bank by the IRS.\n    Is it not a sad irony that all Nations of the world look to \nthe United States as a model of democracy for guidance in the \nestablishment of freedoms and human rights? Yet the IRS as an \nagency of that government grants its administrators such a \nliberal totalitarian hand.\n    Not long ago when Commissioner Rossotti visited the \nManhattan District, no message of his visit was sent to the \ngeneral population of employees because the district had need \nto control the image it presented to the new Commissioner. The \nimage that that district wished to show was one of focus, \nproductivity, and harmony.\n    As the Commissioner watched and listened, selected \nemployees told tales of great accomplishments. Hidden in back \nrooms was the ineptness and the discord.\n    It is not that Commissioner Rossotti chose to see the \ndistrict through rose-colored glasses. It is that Commissioner \nRossotti was deliberately led down an impoverished road where \ndecaying houses had only the sides that faced the road painted \nwhite. The Manhattan District was on a mission to sell their \npiece of real estate as prime. The Commissioner was prevented \nfrom seeing past the facade.\n    If the Commissioner would learn and understand the truth \nabout the Manhattan District, let him put on simple raiment, \nenter the district unattended, re-walk down that road, and talk \nto ordinary employees as if a fellow traveler.\n    As my testimony draws to an end, I would like to raise some \nreasonable questions. If one were to multiply the approximate \nrevenue lost due to the injudicious actions of managers to the \nbenefit of large taxpayers in the first two examples that I \ncited, $24 million and $1 million, by similarly acting managers \nin each district in each region of the country, how much lost \nrevenue would a practical person determine that to be $1 \nbillion, $2 billion, more?\n    If one were to multiply the economic hardship, emotional \ndamage and mental stress placed on each small taxpayer in each \nState throughout the Nation because unfairly forced by the \nservice into tax deficiency in order to fulfill policies and \nquotas of administrators, would a humane person even be able to \nvalue the cost?\n    In conclusion, I should like to read an excerpt from a \nrecent court case where a small taxpayer had the gumption to \nbring an action against the IRS for violation of its rights. \nThe court awarded actual damages for mental stress, emotional \ndamages, and humiliation, as well as punitive damages to the \ntaxpayer.\n    It reads, ``The conduct of our Nation's affairs always \ndemands that public servants discharge their duties under the \nconstitution and laws of this republic with fairness and a \nproper spirit of subservience to the people whom they are sworn \nto serve. Public servants cannot be arbitrarily selective in \ntheir treatment of citizens, dispensing equity to those who \nplease them and withholding it from those who do not. Respect \nfor the law can only be fostered if citizens believe that those \nresponsible for implementing and enforcing the law are \nthemselves acting in conformity with the law. By this award, \nthis Court gives notice to the IRS that reprehensible abuse of \nits authority by any one of its employees cannot and will not \nbe tolerated.''\n    May my words and the words of others testifying before you \ntoday stir you to action. May you bring to taxpayers and to \nInternal Revenue Service employees a renewed acquaintance with \nliberty. And may this century not close before democracy is \nrenewed by the remodeling of this agency and the rewriting of \nits laws. Thank you.\n    The Chairman. Well, thank you, Ms. O'Dwyer. Again, I know \nit takes a great deal of courage and dedication to come before \nthis body and testify as you have today.\n    Ms. Johnson?"

break,break,break,break
"","","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Ms. Johnson. Mr. Chairman, Senators, good morning. My name \nis Minh Thi Johnson. I have been employed with the Internal \nRevenue Service's Los Angeles District Office as a revenue \nagent since January 28, 1991. I am a certified public \naccountant and have a B.A. degree in business administration \nwith emphasis on accounting and finance.\n    I am also currently serving as a lieutenant commander in \nthe Navy reserves with the Supply Corps. My personal \nachievements include a Joint Service Commendation Medal and a \nJoint Service Achievement Medal. Prior to my employment with \nthe IRS, I worked for the Office of the Inspector General at \nthe Housing Department--excuse me--for the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development as an auditor/CPA coordinator for \nover five years.\n    As an employee of the IRS, let me assure you that if I did \nnot care about the IRS or have respect for many of my fellow \nemployees, I would not have bothered to travel all the way from \nCalifornia to be here today.\n    I appear before you today to testify about activities I \nhave personally observed as an IRS employee, activities which I \ndo--I know are not fair, not equitable, clearly not honest, and \nclearly do not serve the American taxpayer.\n    Since the committee's September 1997 hearings on IRS \npractices and procedures, IRS management has openly flaunted \nthe fact that it is not concerned with the Finance Committee \nhearings and that it will carry out business as usual when \nthings quiet down.\n    However, as a result of those hearings, one change did \noccur within the IRS. The direct communication from the chief \nof examinations regarding the circulation of dollars per hour \nto the employees has stopped.\n    However, indirectly, under the guise of what the IRS refers \nto as cycle time and adjustment size, IRS management continues \nits long-time practice of basing employee's advancement and \nrewards on the dollars per hour basis.\n    In general, IRS field agents are simply not allowed enough \ntime by IRS management to thoroughly develop case related \nissues through adequate researching of tax law, court case, \netcetera. Rather, we are ordered by our managers to propose \nadjustments, in this case increases in taxes owed without any \njustification for it.\n    It appears to many of us that aggression coupled with an \naccumulation of high arbitrary tax adjustments is the gateway \nto promotion. Is the standard for promotion based on fairness \nor accuracy? Or are we to accept a standard based on \naggressiveness to satisfy management's desire to achieve large \nadjustments?\n    If there is no quota system, why does the IRS encourage us \nto use such a heavy hand in proposing baseless adjustments, and \npromote the employees who do? I do not believe you can reform \nthe IRS without changing its standards for promotion.\n    I am aware of one branch chief who encourages his revenue \nagents to ignore the larger tax cases that typically have the \nresources to fight IRS claims and inflated adjustments.\n    Instead, that branch chief will have his revenue agents \nfocus on cases involving smaller corporations. Why? Because \nmore often than not, the smaller corporations tend not to have \nthe financial or legal means that larger corporations do to \ndefend themselves against these erroneously high adjustments \nproposed by the IRS.\n    Also of note is the fact that IRS management has hounded \nemployees so much about the time they spend on cases that \nseveral employees, including me, have had to take leave time to \nwork on them at home. By doing so, office time would not be \ncharged against these cases and the average adjustment figure \nwould remain high against the number of office hours spent on \nthem. This is outrageous.\n    While these cases result in the collection of questionable \ntax revenues, the amount collected in these case pales compared \nto what I am about to tell you. This case involves IRS \nemployees who actually recalculate taxes owed by some of the \nlargest corporations in this country in order to reduce the \nlegitimate taxes that are truly owed by these corporations.\n    I am talking about millions and millions of dollars \ndeliberately lost to the Department of the Treasury and under \nthe watchful eye of some of the IRS' own managers.\n    One particular tax case with which I am familiar involved a \ncompany enterprise that had been confronted by the IRS with a \n$70 million tax deficiency. During the time this case was being \nhandled by the IRS, the original IRS team negotiating the case \nwas replaced.\n    Now, it is important to note that at the time the case was \nbeing turned over to the new team, the company had just offered \nto pay the IRS $35 million. In fact, it is my understanding \nthat the corporation had actually made out a check for that \namount, but the IRS rejected it.\n    Because the IRS declined the payment, the company and the \nIRS entered into renewed negotiations. This time the company \nhad a former IRS district director on their negotiating team. \nAnd the new IRS team now consisted of the current district \ndirector and the IRS district counsel.\n    With these two teams in place, the new round of \nnegotiations ended up with the company paying only $22 million \nin taxes. This was $13 million less than the $35 million the \nIRS had previously rejected.\n    When I learned about the final decision, I was furious. I \nraised my concerns and demanded an investigation. However, I \nwas quickly informed by colleagues that the case was a \nforbidden subject and we were not allowed to talk about it.\n    Even as an employee of the IRS, I find it difficult if not \nimpossible to understand how, on the one hand, the IRS will go \nafter small taxpayers for arbitrary adjustments, while on the \nother hand, reduce by millions the amount of real taxes owed by \nextremely wealthy and powerful companies. I do not believe this \nis an isolated case.\n    While I have not been personally involved with other cases, \nI have become aware through other co-workers that large \nadjustments are often being eliminated when IRS management \nnegotiates with former district directors representing large \ncompanies. This is because certain members of IRS management \nhope to earn the thanks for the tax breaks they arrange for the \ncompanies in the form of future employment with those \ncompanies.\n    As a result of my objections to the resolution of the \nspecific case I previously described, I became the focus of \nharassment by other agents. Harassment has included comments on \nthe quality of my work to comments on my Vietnamese heritage.\n    When I told my group manager about what co-workers were \ndoing to me, the IRS management took no action. However, my own \nmanager joined the other agents in the verbal attacks. I was \nencouraged by a co-worker to file an EEO complaint which I did.\n    After my group manager retired, the temporary manager \njoined with a union steward and began telephoning me at home \nboth at night and on the weekends, demanding I withdraw my EEO \ncomplaint.\n    At this point, my husband came to my defense and spoke with \nmy manager about the problems I was experiencing. Shortly after \nmy husband became involved with the EEO issue, his tax return \nfrom the year before we were married was audited.\n    Senator Roth, than you for allowing me to express my \nconcerns as an IRS employee and American citizen about the \nhighly questionable conduct of certain IRS employees.\n    However, IRS management has demonstrated it will retaliate \nseverely against those employees who question its integrity, \nlegality, or the ethics of its actions. Those employees who \ndare question these action in public will certainly pay.\n    Therefore, Senator Roth, I am respectfully requesting the \nprotection of this committee from retaliation by the IRS \nmanagement in any form due to my appearance and testimony \nbefore you today. Thank you.\n    The Chairman. As I said to Ms. O'Dwyer, we appreciate very \nmuch your being here today. We understand that it takes \ntremendous courage to do exactly that under these \ncircumstances. I assure you that Senator Moynihan and I will do \neverything within our power to protect those who come forward \nto testify here. There will be no retaliation.\n    Ms. Johnson. Thank you, sir."

"","","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","STATEMENT OF MICHAEL AYALA, ANALYST, GEORGIA DISTRICT, INTERNAL \n                        REVENUE SERVICE"
break,break,break,break
"","","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Mr. Ayala. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I \nappreciate the opportunity to provide my testimony here today. \nI have a bachelor's degree from Weber College in Ogden, Utah in \ncriminology and military science, and a master's degree from \nthe University of Northern Colorado in communications. I am \nalso a graduate of the officers advanced course administered \nout of Fort Lee, Virginia.\n    I am currently an analyst with the Internal Revenue Service \nin the Georgia District and have worked for IRS for over 30 \nyears. My previous assignments have included working at the IRS \nService Center, as a collector in various districts, as an \nemployment tax examiner, as a manager, and until recently as a \ncompliance analyst on the staff of the regional Commissioner.\n    During my 7 years on the Commissioner's staff, I witnessed \na broad range of misconduct by high-level managers in both tax \nadministration and civil service practices.\n    This misconduct included mistreatment of taxpayers, \ncovering up serious revenue losses, sexual harassment, the \ncreation of false records, improper use of enforcement \nstatistics, covering up misconduct by executives and their \nhigh-level subordinates, and violations of prohibited civil \nservice personnel practices.\n    Such abuses are generally known to a large percentage of \nthe IRS work force, but are perpetuated by management's \nintimidation and punishment of anyone inside the agency who \nobjects or reports such misconduct.\n    Over the course of the last several months, we have read \nand heard about many IRS-related horror stories concerning \nsmall taxpayers and small businesses. I would like to take this \nopportunity to share with you an example of the type of \nbusiness the IRS audited at the opposite end of the scale.\n    In one case with which I am personally familiar, certain \nmembers of IRS management in a particular district actually \nforgave over $30 million of a $50 million tax liability for a \nlarge, influential business concern for no apparent reason.\n    The remaining $20 million was allowed to be paid over a \nfive to six year period. The arrangement which was approved by \nthe IRS, also we waivered the requirements for this same \nbusiness to provide documented justification for its not paying \nthe total amount of liability due. The IRS is also protecting \nit from levies and full tax liens being filed against it.\n    My assignment on this case was literally to stand vigil \nover the 15 State area of the southeast region on behalf of \nthis business to ensure that other IRS employees did not \ninadvertently file liens or levies on the company.\n    It was my job to make certain that this case never got into \nthe hands of unknowing Federal agents who could potentially \ntake enforcement action against it.\n    Such action was actually initiated on several occasions. \nAnd I was required to contact the district involved and stop \nthe pending action.\n    I also believe I have counterparts in the three other \nregions of the country who were assigned similar \nresponsibilities relating to preferential treatment of other \nlarge corporations.\n    To me, this was a clear example of unequal treatment of \ntaxpayers depending on their financial strength and influence. \nIt was also clear to me that those benefitting from such \nsignificant savings are not going to come running to Congress \nto report that the IRS is illegally saving them millions of \ndollars.\n    I am left wondering though about certain members of IRS \nmanagement who have left the agency and were hired at extremely \nhandsome salaries by these large prestigious companies or other \naccounting firms.\n    In another matter, I reported that the district improperly \nclosed 83,621 taxpayer cases. In other words, they simply \nclosed the books on over 80,000 cases without completing the \nprocess of collecting taxes owed on any of them. This was done \nat a cost of many millions of dollars to the public through a \nloss of uncollected revenue.\n    In addition, I was able to report that this same office was \nalso improperly closing over 4,000 taxpayer cases in a project \nthe IRS referred to as the Low Dollar Study.\n    This project was approved by my own manager as well as the \nIRS national office in order to create a statistical advantage \nby improving the district's closure rate. Yet, these actions \ncreated another situation that permitted inconsistent and \nunfair treatment of taxpayers.\n    I will add the following to my report that the \ninvestigation by internal audit found that these cases had \nindeed been closed improperly and should be reassigned for \ncorrective action.\n    In another case, I learned from a number of female \nemployees in the Georgia District that their male manager was \nsexually harassing his female subordinates and rewarding those \nwho accepted his advances and punishing those who rejected him.\n    One case of rewarding behavior involved a female employee \nwith whom he was having a relationship. She allowed a $320,000 \ncollection statute to expire and her manager helped to cover it \nup. When she allowed the expiration of the collection date to \noccur, the IRS lost the ability to collect the $320,000 due the \nDepartment of Treasury. The manager, however, was able to and \ndid make this almost one third of a million dollar mistake \ncompletely disappear.\n    As the acting manager of these employees, I reported this \nmisconduct to both the regional and district executives and the \ndistrict EEO officer. Following my action, the same female \nemployees began their own formal complaints with EEO regarding \ntheir manager and charging him with discrimination and sexual \nharassment. The manager's superiors refused to take any action \nto protect these women from his retaliation or the hostile work \nenvironment he created.\n    In another case, I reported the presence of a striptease \nperformance in the Atlanta Regional Office during office hours \nto the regional EEO officer. Instead of responding to my report \nin a reasonable and concerned manner, the EEO officer actually \nreported my contact with herself to my supervisor and attempted \nto discourage me from pursuing the matter.\n    When I persisted, the regional Commissioner's response was \nto subject the entire regional staff to sensitivity training. \nHowever, the person responsible for having a stripper in the \noffice and the high-level executive manager who approved it, no \naction was taken.\n    The two individuals responsible for this are GS-15 \nexecutive assistants and the EEO officer are still in their \npositions today despite the reported improper conduct.\n    Currently, the Southeast Region is tracking the number of \nseizures made from October 1995 through 1998. They are ranking \nthe districts and are comparing the number of seizures made in \nthe Southeast Region between the respective districts and \nbetween the revenue officers.\n    This is being done in blatant disregard for Policy \nStatement P1-20 and the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. This seizure \ntracking report is titled ``Seizures Southeast Region fiscal \nyear 97'' and it was prepared in January of 1998.\n    It contains pages showing charts with the number of \nseizures made in each district and graphs illustrating the \nnumber of seizures made per revenue officer in each district. \nThe report clearly evaluates each district as improved when \nmore seizures are made and slipped, failed, or disappointing \nwhen fewer seizures are made.\n    This is the second such seizure report issued by the region \nwithin the last year. As long as enforcement comparisons, such \nas seizures, levies, and summons, etcetera continue to be \napplied and used as performance measures for revenue officers \nas well as districts, abuses in this area will naturally \nfollow.\n    In light of the recent scrutiny of the IRS by your \ncommittee, I believe this is not a simply a challenge on the \npart of IRS, but a blatant disregard for recent Congressional \nactions taken to protect taxpayers.\n    Mr. Chairman, after I reported the improper closure of \ntaxpayer cases and sexual harassment, I personally began to \nfeel the pressure of management.\n    After 29 years of excellent service to the agency and being \nthe recipient of awards and high ratings, I am now the \nrecipient of various forms of retaliations, including a \ndemotion. I have no doubt that I have been labeled as a \ndisgruntled employee for reporting the abuses I have witnessed. \nAfter my appearance before you today, I firmly believe this \nretaliation will continue.\n    Mr. Chairman, no IRS employee should fear coming before \nthis committee to testify, although I do. I am here because I, \nlike so many of my colleagues, want so strongly to serve the \ntaxpaying public with honesty and integrity absent the fear of \nmanagement retaliation for doing the right thing. Thank you.\n    The Chairman. Well, thank you very much for being here \ntoday, Mr. Ayala. We appreciate your taking the time and having \nthe courage to testify.\n    And now, I will, call on Ms. Jarvis.\n    Ms. Jarvis. Thank you.\n    The Chairman. Please proceed."

break,break,break,break
"","","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Ms. Jarvis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, \nSenators, Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee. My name \nis Ginger Jarvis. Thank you for the invitation to address you \ntoday.\n    In the interest of time, I am prepared to present a \nsummary. However, I respectfully request that the text of the \nspeech be admitted into the record in its entirety.\n    To briefly summarize my personal qualifications for you, I \nhave earned the following degrees: a degree in business, a \ndegree in accounting, master of science in taxation. I became \nenrolled to practice before the Internal Revenue Service in \n1978. And I have 23 years combined tax experience in both the \nprivate and the public sectors.\n    Even the IRS has recognized by competence by selecting me \nas one of four agents from the Manhattan District to receive \nspecialized training in partnership taxation.\n    Currently, I am an acting team coordinator for large case \nexamination in the Manhattan District. As such, I am \nresponsible for the coordinated examination program which \nexamines the income tax returns of multi, multi-billion dollar, \nmulti-international companies.\n    To effectively execute tax examinations of this magnitude \nrequires a major team effort and expertise of economists, \nengineers, computer audit, international audit, domestic tax \nspecialists, to name just a few.\n    Senators, I appear before you today to inform you of what I \nconsidered to be outrageous abuses that flourish within the \nManhattan District. These offenses are committed by IRS own \nmanagement. And I truly believe the policy is more widely \nspread than I have personally witnessed in Manhattan.\n    At the sole discretion of individual managers, millions, \neven hundreds of millions of tax revenues owed to the U.S. \nTreasury by some of the largest taxpayers in the country are \nliterally forgiven, zeroed out. This is an outrage predicated \non the need of certain managers to improve statistics, to gain \npersonal awards, or who seek solace in careers outside the IRS.\n    The Manhattan District is a haven for this type of \nbehavior. And I will describe situations that I have personally \nwitnessed during my tenure in this office.\n    As a member of an audit team, I was recently brought in to \nreview the tax returns of an extremely large consolidated group \nof companies. My analysis strongly suggested that several \nhundreds of millions of dollars have been laundered. In \naddition, income from an installment sale in the range of \nseveral billion, that's B as in boy, billion dollars does not \nappear to have been reported for income tax purposes.\n    On numerous occasions over the 14 months that it took to \ndevelop these extraordinary findings, I attempted to discuss \nthe issues with the IRS case manager. Without exception, each \nand every time I addressed the subject, he refused to look at \nmy work papers, he refused to discuss the technical merits with \nme, and he just basically dismissed me.\n    Out of sheer frustration, I turned to the team coordinator \nand described what appeared to be a multi-billion dollar money \nlaundering operation that was unreported for tax purposes.\n    The team coordinator then addressed my findings to the case \nmanager, the same one who had previously refused to discuss the \nmatter with me. The IRS manager's reaction to my raising these \nconcerns was to throw me off the case.\n    Is it reasonable to assume that this manager's judgment may \nbe impaired? He manages a professional prize fighter, teaches \npart-time, and operates what appears to be a tax law practice \nfrom a private office provided to him by the taxpayer. I ask \nyou, at what cost?\n    Today, I implore each of you initially to initiate an \ninvestigation into this matter. I believe that I am imminently \nqualified to raise the specter of money laundering and tax \nevasion to which I now add collusion.\n    Another image that will remain indelibly engraved in my \nmind is the time that I witnessed three agents as they emerged \nfrantically from a meeting in which that very same large-case \nmanager had commented to the taxpayer, and please understand I \nam paraphrasing here, for a stated sum of money he might be \nable to make the specialist adjustment go away. If that remark \nhad even remotely been made in jest, the agents would not have \nbeen quite so upset.\n    However, in that instance, the specialist ultimately \nprevailed in assessing a tax adjustment in the range of a few \nhundred million dollars primarily because he had received the \nfull backing and support of his own manager and his own branch \nchief. In addition, that specialist proposed a penalty in the \ntens of millions of dollars.\n    A few years ago, I discovered an abusive tax scheme where \nnearly $400 million of taxable income was potentially \nunreported. I worked closely with IRS attorneys to develop the \nfacts of the case over a two-year period.\n    Eventually, the Manhattan District counsel dropped the \nissue. And hundreds of millions of dollars literally went \nuntaxed. It is important to understand that the participating \ntaxpayers in that study were not limited to the Manhattan \nDistrict. And as circumstances would have it, a related case \nwas taken to court in another district where my position, as \npresented by the government, was upheld and is now considered \nto be a landmark case.\n    I am aware of many cases that have been ordered closed as \nno-change, a term describing the status assigned to a case \nwhere the Internal Revenue Service has determined that there \nwill be no change to the figures as originally filed on the tax \nreturn.\n    Other cases have had huge adjustments drastically reduced \nas a result of what I believe to be improper influence within \nthe district.\n    Another highly questionable activity that is taking place \nin the Manhattan District, and I believe is occurring around \nthe country, is the return of former IRS senior managers who \nhave elected a second career as tax advisors. Many of these \nretirees have elected to remain in or around the Manhattan \nDistrict. And as such, they now represent taxpayers before the \nIRS.\n    Since many of these former senior executives and managers \nhave only recently separated from the service, many of their \nformer colleagues and friends are still actively employed. As a \nresult, I believe the newly-established tax advisor can take \nhis or her client before the former colleague with the \nexpectation of receiving decisions favoring their clients.\n    One particular case comes to mind where I was prohibited by \nthe case manager from proposing a $6 million adjustment to the \ncompany under examination. Earlier, that case manager had \nboasted to the team that he had gone to school with the owner.\n    The team later discussed the expectations that I would \nexperience great resistance from him in enforcing the \nadjustment that I had spent months developing. As was \npredicted, the case manager refused to discuss the tax issues, \nrefused to look at the work papers, and refused to permit the \n$6 million adjustment to be proposed.\n    Beginning with my current branch chief----\n    Senator Mack. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if I might ask a \nclarifying question here. Was that the same case manager that \nyou referred to earlier in your testimony?\n    Ms. Jarvis. Yes, Senator Mack, it was.\n    Senator Mack. All right. Thank you.\n    Ms. Jarvis. My current manager--excuse me, not my current \nmanager. Please, she is an exception. My current branch chief \nmaintains monthly statistics of dollar yield per hour per agent \nby agent name. I believe the statistic is used as a tool to \nassign tax returns to agents they wish to control or demote or \ndowngrade or to promote those who do their bidding.\n    There are executives without college degrees who have \nattained the levels of at least grades 14 and 15. Last Sunday's \nNews Day quoted Senator Moynihan in regard to the line item \nveto. And I quote, this is a formula for executive tyranny. End \nquote.\n    I believe the Senator's analysis is applicable to the \nsituation I have just described. This is not said with \nmalicious intent to disparage anyone. And there are exceptions \nto the rule. But the very nature of the job exceeds the limited \ncapabilities of the executives without college degrees.\n    In stark contrast, there are agents stuck in the lower \nlevels of grade 13 and below who have earned MBAs, CPAs, JDs, \nLLMs, are licensed attorneys. These highly qualified \nindividuals appear to be deliberately held down and back \nbecause of their technical ability.\n    By virtue of simply opening their mouths to ask a question \nor express an opinion, they expose the weaknesses of those \nabove them.\n    In one particular case, a $10 million adjustment was never \nassessed against the taxpayer because the statute of \nlimitations ran out while the case was languishing in the \nprocessing department.\n    In its own self defense, the processing department claimed \nit was waiting for district counsel to obtain an extension. \nCounsel's response was that it was waiting for the processing \ndepartment to secure the statute.\n    This internal squabbling took place under the nose of \nunfocused and inattentive management, rendered several years' \nworth of investigative work by a team of revenue agents a \ncomplete waste of time and caused $10 million of tax revenue to \nsimply vanish in thin air.\n    Senators, at this time, it is worthy of note the Manhattan \nDistrict is the lowest revenue raising district in the country.\n    A few years ago, an organization was established by several \nretired IRS senior executives from Washington. The stated \npurpose is to act as liaison between the service and its member \nbody of large companies under the guise of the spirit of \ncooperation.\n    Remarks passed by IRS agents at meetings are reported in \nthe organization's newsletter accompanied by photos of the \nagents. Profiles as to the agents' strengths and weaknesses are \ncirculated among the membership. I believe the organization is \nintended for the purpose of spreading among its membership \ntechniques to design to frustrate an audit.\n    The IRS has placed into practice in the spirit of \ncooperation a policy whereby at the completion of the \nexamination of a company, the service is now requesting that \nthe taxpayer under audit provide detailed evaluations of the \nagents assigned to the case.\n    Those evaluations are then returned to upper management for \nreview. It is grossly unrealistic to expect the non-compliant \ntaxpayer to return a survey thanking the agents for showing \nthem the error of their ways.\n    Eventually, the surveys cascade down where they affect the \nagents' performance evaluations. Ultimately, the evaluation \nimpacts negatively on work assignments, promotions, salaries, \netcetera.\n    I believe the salaries in the New York IRS area are below \nthat of other Federal agencies in the New York area. In \nManhattan, we are no longer paid to do a job, but to take \nabuse.\n    Commissioner Rossotti has announced plans to restructure \nthe IRS based on responses compiled from the survey feedback \naction. However, the results are flawed. Many of the agents and \nstaff have not responded truthfully because the surveys were \npresented to their managers for review immediately upon \ncompletion.\n    I personally have experience reprisal as a result of the \nSFA. And I am aware of several others who have been castigated \nby management for their responses to the SFA as well.\n    On several occasions, I witnessed what I believe is the \noperation of a private tax law practice out of an audit site by \na case manager. To this day, it is my understanding that he \nstill avails himself of the taxpayer's facilities and the \ngovernment staff to provide secretarial services for his own \npersonal gain.\n    It is an openly discussed topic among agents that this \nmanager has previously conducted his private tax law practice \nfrom the second floor of the IRS office building for several \nyears before relocating to the taxpayer's facility in an \nupscale Manhattan area. The unreconcilable question is, at what \nprice?\n    I really never had an alternative other than to blow the \nwhistle regarding my concerns of money laundering, tax evasion, \nand collusion. I was simply doing my job.\n    Nevertheless, since reporting my findings, I have been \nsubjected to a continuously pervasive, hostile, and often \nintimidating work environment.\n    Initially, I reported the facts to the regional inspection \nand provided them with copies of my work papers. I then \nnotified the branch chief, the chief of exam, the union, the \nOffice of Special Counsel, and several members of the House and \nSenate. I have circulated in excess of 100 memos.\n    In the final analysis, inspection division routinely \nreports back to the district they could not become involved in \nthe case where the IRS manager refused to assess the \nadjustments because that type of complaint is not within their \njurisdiction.\n    The branch chief looked back two weeks, reclassified leave \nas AWOL, and stopped my salary without notifying me. AWOL is an \noffense subject to termination. At the time, I had a \nphysician's letter and I had accumulated a reserve of 250 hours \nof unused annual leave.\n    The district director did not answer my memos. And I am \nstill waiting for a response to any one of the eight detailed \nreports that I have filed with the Office of Special Counsel.\n    The offices of several legislators responded to the effect \nthat they regarded the subject matter of my letters to be \ncovered under the Hatch Act and therefore were prohibited from \nintervening in the matter.\n    At this time, I respectfully request that those offices \nreview the intent of the Hatch Act in light of the facts that I \nhave just presented. I do not believe the Hatch Act was \nintended to protect management in the commission of a crime.\n    Senators, I fail to comprehend how the IRS is able to \nconduct a thorough investigation into any issue, an issue an \nIRS employee raises involving collusion, money laundering, and \ntax evasion without someone in IRS management being compelled \nto interview the employee.\n    There are others within the IRS with the same knowledge \nthat I possess regarding this case. However, I am the only one \nwilling to come forward. It has been nearly two and a half \nyears. And IRS management still has not questioned me about it. \nAppearing before you today as I am is my final resort.\n    There is an adage at the IRS: if you cannot attack the \nissue, then you attack the agent. I am not alone when I say \nkill the messenger mentality pervades the service on a country-\nwide basis.\n    Since blowing the whistle, I have been subjected as many \nothers have to a continuously pervasive, hostile, and often \nintimidating work environment. I was suspended without pay \nbecause I blew the whistle. The assistant district director has \nnotified me in writing and I present the letter here.\n    The assistant district director has notified me in writing \nthat he is withholding the decision to rescind the January 1997 \nsuspension without pay, and I quote, pending the results of the \nongoing investigation. I ask, what does one have to do with the \nother? Justice delayed is justice denied.\n    Mr. Chairman, I could continue to list instances I have \nwitnessed and personally experienced that parallel those I have \nalready described to you today. I could also describe \nadditional actions taken against me personally because of my \nreporting what I believed to be abuses committed by colleagues.\n    I have revealed what I believe are some very serious abuses \noccurring behind the one-way mirrors of the IRS. When our hands \nare tied by intimidating management and flawed practices, we \nare prevented from doing the job we were hired to do, that is \nferret out the non-compliant.\n    The IRS must no longer conduct business in the same old way \nthat turns a blind eye on the suspect and the blatantly \ndishonest actions of its own management. I ask for your help in \nshattering this one way, self-serving attitude of so many \nwithin the IRS management.\n    Senators, Senator, Mr. Chairman, quite frankly, I believe \nthat I will experience further retaliation for appearing before \nyou today. Therefore, I respectfully, Mr. Chairman, request \nthat the guarantee of protection from reprisal be extended to \ninclude my small circle of family and friends.\n    The Chairman. Are you finished?\n    Ms. Jarvis. No, sir. I am asking for a response.\n    The Chairman. I say this to each of you on this panel, will \ntake steps to ensure that you are not retaliated against.\n    Ms. Jarvis. I do not want my family's returns being \nexamined or harassed or my friends as well.\n    In conclusion, I would like to express my gratitude for the \nopportunity to address this distinguished panel. Thank you, \ngentlemen, and have a good day. And I would be willing to \nentertain any questions that you may have.\n    The Chairman. Well, thank you for being here today. As you \nknow, the purpose of these hearings is to help ensure that the \nkind of problems raised by you do not happen again.\n    The Chairman. And I want to express my appreciation to each \nof you for being here to discuss some of your experiences. I \nwill note again that each of you testified under oath. And I \nknow it is not easy to do what you did. And you are all \nconcerned about retaliation.\n    On your charges of money laundering, a very serious charge, \nwe will take steps to see that that is investigated further, \nbut thank you again for being here today.\n    During our hearings this week, several members have raised \nconcerns over revenues lost to the government that should have \nbeen collected. In your testimony, you each described the \nzeroing out or arbitrary reduction by the IRS of monies owed \nthe government. I would like to ask you, each of you, in your \nopinion, does this practice result in significant amounts of \nrevenue lost to the U.S. Treasury because of uncollected taxes?\n    Ms. O'Dwyer.\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. It does. Yes, it does.\n    The Chairman. Ms. Johnson.\n    Ms. Johnson. Yes, it does, sir.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Ayala.\n    Mr. Ayala. Yes, Senator, it does. There are no special \nrules for managers at any level to deviate from our laws, \nregulations, and standards of treating taxpayers fairly across \nthe board. But this does happen. And sadly, the result is a \nlack of public confidence and trust for the service.\n    The Chairman. Ms. Jarvis.\n    Ms. Jarvis. Yes, Mr. Chairman, I believe that it does, \nparticularly in the Manhattan District. It may account for the \nreason that Manhattan is the lowest revenue raising district in \nthe country.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Ayala, you somewhat touched on my next \nquestion, but again, I would like to ask each of you. When an \nIRS auditor finds a large tax deficiency and decides to zero \nout or reduce that deficiency, what checks and balances exist \non the auditor to ensure that their action is appropriate, or \non managers? Mr. Ayala, do you want to answer?\n    Mr. Ayala. Sure. I am not aware of any checks or balances. \nI think there are some government checks and balances that are \nsupposed to work that are in place that do not work.\n    The upper-level management to do various things, they have \nabsolute power. There is nobody that is going to challenge \ntheir powers to do what they want to do as they want to do it.\n    I, too, have been the special counsel and written them a \nnumber of times for protection. And they have not responded or \nresponding that it is just not whistle blower type things that \nthey are going to protect employees from.\n    I do have, I brought with me a copy of a 1996 report to the \nCongress from the U.S. Office of Special Counsel. And it shows \nthat in the thousands of complaints that they got from Federal \nemployees in 1996, they ordered three stays of protection. And \nit shows in the past five or 6 years that they have issued 16 \nstays of protection for Federal employees. And that is about an \naverage of three a year of the thousands that are filed.\n    This is adequate to protect employees and to keep some of \nthese things that are going on in check or in balance.\n    The Chairman. If I could please interrupt. I appreciate \nwhat you said. But the question I was really trying to get at \nis where there is a deficiency. What checks and balances are \nthere, on either the auditor or the supervisor to ensure if \nthey are waived, that the action is appropriate? Is there any \ndollar limit, for example?\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. No.\n    The Chairman. Ms. O'Dwyer.\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. There is no dollar limit, no. It is actually \nan examiner does the examining of the case. The manager can \nreview the case, discuss the adjustments with the agent. And he \nshould generally go along because the examiner is the person \nwho has the technical competence.\n    In my particular case, the manager just did it to meet a \ndeadline. I cannot answer for the other cases. And the other \ncase I quoted was also just to meet a deadline. They did not \nwant overage cases. And there was no absolute reason other than \nthat.\n    The Chairman. But you would agree that the supervisor has \nsome responsibility for using independent judgment? It is just \nnot to endorse whatever comes up?\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. You mean, the supervisor is supposed to have \nan awareness of the case. The examiner, a good manager always \nhas the knowledge of a case. We get reviewed constantly. They \nlook at the cases. They ask questions on a case. They are fully \naware of what is going on in the case.\n    If there appears to be no audit issue or if it will take an \nexcessive amount of time to develop, you will get diminimus \ntax. That is when you decide to withdraw the issue. And you do \nnot do it.\n    The responsibility for the case basically is the agent, but \nultimately the manager assumes the responsibility for the case. \nIt depends if it is a large case or small case also. It is \ndifferent.\n    The Chairman. Ms. Johnson, did you want to comment?\n    Ms. Johnson. No, sir, because she states it correctly. And \nthat is the same in the Los Angeles District, sir.\n    The Chairman. Well, the time is growing late. I think I \nwill turn to you, Senator Moynihan."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    I have no questions, sir. I have learned \na great deal. And I want to say to Ms. Jarvis, repeat what \nSenator Roth, the chairman, said that no one is going to \nretaliate against you. Or if you think that is happening, you \njust call us up.\n    The Chairman. Senator Grassley.\n    Senator Grassley. First of all, I might owe Senator \nMoynihan an apology because it may have sounded like I was not \nsupporting what he said about the fact that he would do what he \njust said he would do. And I believe that he will do everything \nhe can to do what he said he would do. And I compliment him for \nthat. And I would do the same thing for Iowa constituents.\n    The point I was trying to make is that this bureaucracy is \nso massive and the subtle ways in which people can be \nretaliated against, it is sometimes just practically impossible \nto keep on top of it all. So I want to apologize to Senator \nMoynihan."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Let me thank my colleague and friend for \nmany years.\n    Senator Grassley. I would like to get something straight. \nAnd it is repetitive. I suppose it is so obvious, I should not \neven repeat it. But you witnesses are telling us that millions \nand at least millions of dollars in taxes due are being \nforgiven by IRS managers each year. This is done, I think I get \nthe impression, to boost careers, to make statistics look good?\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. Correct. To meet a deadline, to meet \ndeadlines.\n    Senator Grassley. To meet deadlines.\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. At one time when I first went into \ninternational, basically there was no deadlines. And that is \nwhat we were informed. And then, the deadlines became 36 \nmonths, then 24 months and then down to 18 months.\n    And managers have been called on the carpet if they have \naging cases within the group. And the manager will take the \nbrunt of it. Then, it will come down to the agent. And then, \nthey will--if anything will delay a case.\n    And all managers do not do this. We are not saying all \nmanagers do this, but a manager basically who is more insecure \nwill then order the case closed and no-change. You can have \nno--there is no protest. There is nothing you can do.\n    Senator Grassley. So it is done just to make the IRS look \ngood and the individuals at the IRS to look good. And who is \nreally paying for this? It seems to me that the American \ntaxpayer is paying for this. The constituents pay for it.\n    It seems that we hear from and I hear from the little guy. \nI hear from the taxpayer who works hard to make ends meet, ends \nup with a tax liability. And the IRS goes after his house, goes \nafter his bank account. And if the tax is due, obviously they \nshould. But the extent to which there is a harassment of the \nlittle guy and at the higher end, taxpayers, you are indicating \nto us, they get away with it.\n    My point is that the IRS always seems to be after the \nlittle person. We even had testimony on this I think back in \nSeptember from one of the agents that said, we were told to go \nafter the little guy. They do not have the resources to fight \nit.\n    And so we heard yesterday about how the IRS can threaten \nand seize and ruin lives in order to get less money, much, much \nless money than the millions that are owed by the larger \ntaxpayers that you are talking about.\n    So the IRS seems to be squeezing the little guy to get the \nmoney while this set of four witnesses are telling us that the \nbig tax liability is often forgiven. And the cause of this, of \ncourse, I think, and it is basic unfairness is the lack of \naccountability.\n    There is an environment within the IRS of intimidation of \nthe little guy and within the top management, as you tell us, \nfor careers to look good, for advancements to be made. It is \nokay to wink at the larger taxpayer basically is what is being \ndone.\n    So I think it is an appalling situation, but one that I \nthink that we can do something about. I think our legislation \nwill do something about it. And I think future, ongoing \noversight that the chairman of the committee has promised will \ndo something about it.\n    And as I said in my statement that I was partially \napologetic--or that I was apologizing to Senator Moynihan \nabout, I went on to say earlier this morning that it is partly \nwe tend to blame the IRS, but there is an awful lot of fault \nthat rests with Congress, not only for this bureaucracies that \nwe do not do the proper job of oversight that we ought to do.\n    So I thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    I thank you. And once again, I thank my \nfriend and colleague. No apology was in order. I in fact knew \nwhat he meant.\n    Senator Kerrey, I believe you and Senator Grassley have \nbeen working together on this subject. And you are next on \nSenator Roth's time sheet."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, let \nme reference Senator Grassley. And he is very much involved \nwith the development of changes in the law, the Taxpayer Bill \nof Rights 1, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2 that I think has \nchanged.\n    I think we have gotten a substantial number of improvements \nin the operation. And I just want to stipulate that. I think \nCongress has not been just sitting on its hands. We have \nresponded in two very precise occasions. And this is an attempt \nto further take action.\n    I want to also inform my colleagues that the restructuring \ncommission that was started in 1995 had interviews with over \n300 IRS employees, many of which were conducted in public \nhearings.\n    I want to stipulate there is one area that we did not hear \nthat I want to comment on. But a lot of things we heard today \nhave been incorporated both into the House and the Senate bill.\n    And I want to make sure that our witnesses have the \nopportunity. And I will just give you the copies of the \nlegislation. And if you will take special note of the Titles \n1101, 1102, and 1103.\n    Those are the titles that reference the problems that \nattempt to create a resolution were the problems that you \nbrought to us today that other employees have also brought to \nus are being addressed, in addition, in Titles 1204, 3421, \n3701, 3706, and 3709.\n    And I urge you do not be intimidated by writing laws \nbecause some of you may not be lawyers. You say, well, I cannot \ndo this. I am not a lawyer either. Senator Gramm is not a \nlawyer. We do just fine in writing laws. I urge you to give \ncareful consideration to these things. And I will get it to \nyou.\n    I will call to my colleagues' attention that I asked in a \nprevious hearing, Mr. Epstein who is here, he is a tax \npractitioner, I asked him the same question. And I reiterate, \none of the problems that I have with these hearings is that we \nare not asking the witness to comment on law that we have \nalready reported out of the committee. And Mr. Epstein has \nidentified two or three I think very, very good changes that \nwould improve the legislation.\n    So I hope that you will take my offer in good faith, even \nthough the time may be short. We have until next week when it \nis likely we will be taking this up on the floor.\n    If you, as a result of your personal experience with this, \nhave some suggestions to us that would enable us when we pass \nthe law to do something more than just to issue a press release \nsaying we have fixed the problem. We hope that the law will \nshow the same kind of progress that we have seen with Taxpayer \nBill of Rights number 1 and number 2.\n    I will also point out to colleagues, I mean, we just sort \nof get whipsawed on this deal. And the witnesses yesterday said \nwe are doing too much. What you are saying to us is we are not \ndoing enough.\n    And I want to, Ms. Jarvis, accept your offer. I would \nintend, unless persuaded otherwise, that I should send a letter \nto the Inspector General asking to investigate the situation \nthat you have described because the situation that you have \ndescribed borders on fraud where individuals are essentially \nsaying that I am going to give a hair cut to a claim as a \nconsequence of believing that I might get employment out in the \nprivate sector. I have a special relationship of some kind.\n    And that is the one area in the restructuring commission. \nWe hear none of this kind of an allegation. That is a very, \nvery serious issue as far as I am concerned. And I accept your \noffer to follow up either with you directly or through the \nInspector General's office.\n    And finally, Mr. Chairman, I would ask that approximately, \nI think it is 13 cases that we heard, there are some complaints \nabout the Criminal Investigation Division, actually 14 cases, \nagain, I call my colleagues' attention to these as well, 14 \ncases the Criminal Investigation Division handled. And I think \nthey handled it quite properly and in all cases.\n    I mean, one guy runs Big John's Restaurant and Recreational \nCenter in Jackson, Mississippi. No doubt, he could come before \nthe committee and say he was abused, not according to the U.S. \nAttorney. He was laundering money.\n    No doubt, in the Middle District of Florida, the individual \nwas running the Inner Circle Lounge would say that his rights \nwere abused, not according to the U.S. Attorney. He was \nlaundering money and involved with drugs. No doubt as well, all \nthese other individuals would say that they have problems.\n    And I would urge my colleagues as we move to the floor to \ndebate this and we are talking about making changes in the law \nto remember that in addition to some very good examples of \nabuse of power, we have some very good examples where the power \nwas applied exactly as we intended it to with laws that we \nenacted in 1986, 1988, and 1994 to make certain that this \nproblem of fighting the war on drugs is fully engaged.\n    And I would ask consent that all 14 of these be included as \npart of our record.\n    The Chairman. Without objection.\n    The Chairman. Senator Moseley-Braun.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. \nAt the outset, I want to thank Senator Gramm for allowing me to \ngo ahead. I have a meeting to go to, but I did want to ask a \ncouple of specific questions, if not to these witnesses, then \nto the witnesses who will come tomorrow.\n    I am very concerned about some of the procedural issues \nthat have been raised by these witnesses. It is my \nunderstanding it is already against the law for agents to have \ndual employment.\n    And if indeed they are holding down second jobs and \nmoonlighting and the like, I think we need to have some report \nfrom the department about this. I mean, IRS needs to respond to \nthe level of enforcement on that score in terms of dual \nemployment. That seems to me to be a terrible, terrible \nproblem.\n    The second issue that I would like to have some responses \nto has to do with the issue of failure to respond to EEO and \nemployment complaints. Mrs. Jarvis testified that she had not \nheard back on eight different cases that have been sent to the \nchief counsel's office. And that I do not understand why \nemployees are not getting their specific issues addressed by \nmanagement. And so I would like very much to get some responses \nto that.\n    A third area where I am very concerned and I would like \nsome kind of analysis, and this seems to come through a number \nof our hearings, has to do with the notion that more time, \nenergy, and money is put in chasing little guys, if you will, \nthan going after the big tax cheats, the big corporations who \nare not paying their fair share. And I think that will \nobviously just undermine the confidence in the system overall.\n    I would like very much to know whether or not anyone in the \nIRS can tell us if there is any kind of cost benefit analysis \nin terms of what it is they do, how much time gets spent on the \nsmaller taxpayers vis-a-vis the amount of time that is spent on \nthe really big taxpayers.\n    Ms. Jarvis, you wanted to say something?\n    Ms. Jarvis. Yes, I do, Senator. The upper management \nmaintains record on hourly rate of return per agent by agent \nname. So it is in the control, it is in the hands of \nmanagement.\n    They can selectively choose tax returns that either will \nhave no potential to give to a more qualified agent if they \nwant to keep down or they can selectively choose a return \nbefore examination to give to someone who is technically more \nlight just to get someone that might do their bidding so that \nthey can promote that individual. That is in the choices, the \nfreedom of the management.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. Well, that is a very--that is yet \nanother issue. And that is very important follow-up. And I \nwould like again tomorrow some response to the frequency in \nwhich that practice takes place.\n    Ms. Jarvis. That is done on a monthly basis. The hourly \nrate of return per agent per name by agent name is d1 monthly.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. But the selective assignment to \norder to hold back one employee versus another, that kind of--\n--\n    Ms. Jarvis. Oh, that is done with inventory.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. Right. Yes, Ms. O'Dwyer.\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. I was just going to agree and say that is done \nconsistently. And when she is done, I would like to answer each \nof your three questions.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. All right. Well, I do not know that \nwe--I hope that we will have a chance to.\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. I want to correct some statements then.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. All right.\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. That is what it is.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. All right.\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. When you are ready.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. All right. Then, why don't you do \nthat right now? I mean, I am ready.\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. You said that you thought that employees are \nallowed to hold outside employment.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. No, no, are not. It is already the \nlaw that they are not allowed to hold. I have been advised it \nis already the law that employees are not allowed to hold \noutside employment.\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. No. We have been informed that we are. And we \ncannot do anything that leads to tax, anything that will go, \nappear on a tax return. We will be kept away from doing \nfinancial accountings. If you wanted to sell shoes part-time on \nSaturday, you could do that.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. Right.\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. There are lines of employment that we are \nallowed to do, but there must be permission to do it. That is \nthe first thing.\n    And then, the other thing you said, was there more time and \nenergy spent on going after the little guy? I would say, no. He \nis much easier to do and it goes much faster. You spend a lot \nof time on large cases. And you spend a lot of resources, a lot \nof hours. And then, it is zeroed out. In that period of time, \nyou could do 30, 40 or 50 little people.\n    And little people can be sometimes--little cases can be \ndone quickly. If you are doing a certain project, like I \nmentioned the hobby loss project, that can be just done in 24 \nhours, 24 hours spent on it. You just go and just keep doing \nit.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. Right. I appreciate that.\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. That is what I wanted to say.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. Well, I thank you for the \nclarification, Ms. O'Dwyer. I guess my question that I would \nlike the Service to respond to tomorrow in terms of dual \nemployment has to do with Ms. Jarvis spoke to someone who \nactually had a tax practice outside of the agency.\n    Ms. Jarvis. I have witnessed that.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. Right.\n    Ms. Jarvis. And law practice.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. And that is illegal.\n    Ms. Jarvis. Yes, correct.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. All right. So that is what I would \nlike to have again tomorrow if the service can respond to that.\n    And your point is very well taken about the time spent on \nthe little guy.\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. Not necessarily. It can go very quickly.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. Right. Right. Right.\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. And another thing, I would just like to say on \nthe failure to reply to EEO or grievances, that is consistent. \nYou can have grievances that are outstanding for 2 years. They \nwill deep six them. They will ignore them. I have an EEO \ncomplaint I filed years ago. I never got an answer. I knew I \ndid not have the time to continue. It was deep sixed because it \nwas against an administrator.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. Right.\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. I never expected to hear from it again. And \nthere are grievances right now out for two years, EEO \ncomplaints. They do not bother to answer them. They just think \nif they ignore it, it will go away.\n    Senator Moseley-Braun. Well, I just want in closing to say \nthat someone, one of your testimony said it is going to be \nbusiness as usual when these hearings are over. That was you, \nMs. Johnson.\n    I do not think so. I think if anything the fact that the \ncommittee has taken up its oversight responsibility. And the \nfact that there is public attention on this issue, and with Mr. \nRossotti coming, I think we are going to see some real changes.\n    And certainly, everybody here is determined that you guys \nwill not have to suffer any retaliation by virtue of your \ncooperating. This is just, you know, citizenship at its best \nwhat you are doing. And we are certainly going to see to it \nthat you do not suffer as a result of it. Thank you very much. \nThank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Senator Gramm.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Moseley-Braun."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Mr. Chairman, can I just quickly ask to \nbe excused? As I told you earlier, I am required to be on the \nfloor at noon to offer an amendment on NATO expansion. So I \nwill not be able to hear Senator Gramm, but I will look forward \nto an account of what he has said. And thank you for this very \nilluminating panel which the morning has only begun.\n    The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator Moynihan.\n    Senator Gramm.\n    Senator Gramm. Well, Mr. Chairman, I have to go over and \noppose Senator Moynihan's amendment. [Laughter.]\n     But he has plenty of time to give a speech before I get \nthere. I do not have any questions. I just want to make three \ncomments that I move to make as a result of other points that \nhave been made.\n    First of all, I think it is very important we do not get \ninto this business of little guys and big guys when we are \ntalking about tax cheats. I have no sympathy for little guys \nwho cheat on their taxes or big guys who cheat on their taxes. \nThey are all criminals. They ought to be pursued.\n    And quite frankly, if I had my way, I would be willing to \nmarginally lose money pursuing tax cheats because that rewards \npeople who comply with the law and it encourages people to \ncomply with the law.\n    So I do not want to get into this business where, you know, \nwe decide, we do not go after the little guy because we are not \ngoing after the big guy. Tax cheats are tax cheats. And we \nought to be vigorously pursuing them.\n    I also want to thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, you \nlisten to these things. And every once in awhile you get ideas \nrelated to our bill. I think one of the conclusions, for \nexample, yesterday I reached is it ought not to be legal for \nthe IRS to force somebody to sign a legal document that \nprevents them from suing the IRS as a result of what they have \ndone.\n    What we are letting them do is to legally intimidate people \nby saying we will stop making your life miserable if you will \nsign an agreement that you will not make our life miserable. I \nwould like to see that illegal. I think it ought to be banned \nfor the IRS to enter into this agreement and force other people \nto do it. I think people ought to always preserve their right \nto sue the government and the Internal Revenue Service.\n    I would like to say finally what continues to bother me and \nit is clear through all of your testimonies is that we have in \nIRS a system which is basically a closed system where people \nare or they act is they are above the law and above the rules \nthat apply to everybody else.\n    We hear over and over that complaints are made. I do not \nhow you judge the quality of these complaints. I do not know \nwhether they are valid or they are not valid, but I think it is \ninteresting that nothing ever seems to happen.\n    We have people who steal 20 cars and they retire with their \nfull benefits. We have people who commit or are substantially \nalleged to commit sexual harassment and they get promoted to \nEEOC officers. And then, they are released for sexual \nharassment.\n    I mean, it seems to me that one constant pattern here is \nabuse of power. And it all goes back to the point that is so \neasy to raise and I do not know the solution to it. And that is \nthis agency has too much power. There are no checks and \nbalances within this agency. There is no consistent review of \nwhat they do.\n    We had two of the senior Inspector General officials of the \nTreasury Department here yesterday just holding up their hands. \nWell, you know, we ask these questions. Nothing ever seemed to \nhappen. We do not know what happened to these people. It seems \nas if no one has the power to hold this agency accountable.\n    And in each of your cases with threats of reprisal, people \ncalling you up in the middle of the night, and Ms. Johnson.\n    Ms. Jarvis. Yes, sir.\n    Senator Gramm. Somebody might get killed calling my wife up \nin the middle of night to harass her, you know. Where I come \nfrom, we do not put up with that stuff.\n    And let me just finally add that I am not sure you are not \ngoing to have retaliation against you. And I just add my voice \nto people who are concerned about it. And I am not convinced \nthat these people are not so arrogant that they think they can \ndo it and get away with it. And it is hard to measure it.\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. And it is easy for them to do.\n    Senator Gramm. And see, we do not know, you know. We do not \nhave a way of judging your competence. We do not, you know. It \nis going to be very difficult for us to protect you. And we \nwant to try to do it, but it is a very difficult thing. And \nagain, I would just like to thank you for coming forward.\n    Yes, Ms. Jarvis.\n    Ms. Jarvis. Senator, I would just like to say that there is \na way to measure my competence. The particular situation that I \nspoke of with the hundreds of millions of dollars of money \nlaundering and the billions of dollars of unreported income \nfrom a sale, that statute is still open. Anyone can go in and \nlook at those tax returns. They are under examination now under \nthe supervision of that same case manager.\n    Senator Gramm. Well, I appreciate that. And we should \neither do it or have staff look at it. I mean, these are the \nkind of things that we need to follow up on and try to find out \nexactly what is happening. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Senator Mack\n    Senator Mack. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And to each of you \nwho testified to us this morning, it is hard for me to even \nimagine what anxiety each of you has gone through in \npreparation for your testimony this morning. Just preparing the \ntestimony under normal circumstances is a difficult thing.\n    Being here before the Senate is not an easy thing to do. \nAnd then, when you layer on top of that the fear of retaliation \nto yourselves and to your family, that is very, very difficult \nthing to do. And I commend you for making the effort and being \nhere this morning.\n    We will do our best. As both Senator Moynihan and Senator \nhave said, we will do our best to protect you from that.\n    There are a couple of questions I do want to ask. And let \nme start with Ms. O'Dwyer.\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. Yes.\n    Senator Mack. In your testimony, you talked about I guess \nformer members of the service who come back?\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. Yes, I did.\n    Senator Mack. Are you personally aware of any instances in \nwhich former IRS employees improperly represented taxpayers \nbefore the IRS in matters that they were involved in while at \nthe IRS?\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. I personally have not had that when I dealt \nwith them. I have dealt with representatives who have come \nback, but they have--they were not in that position, but they \ndid attempt to intimidate. I was told by one.\n    When we conclude a case or we make an agreement, it is \ncalled a revenue agent's report or a 5701 proposed adjustments. \nThey were dictating to me what I should put in it. And I said I \nam not beholden to you. I am doing what I should do. They would \nattempt, they will try to bypass you. They will go to the \nmanger.\n    But there are other cases, including right now that have \nbeen in progress. Where former administrators, there is a two-\nrule they cannot come back.\n    Senator Mack. Right.\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. They have come back. And they have attempted \nto do it. I am not involved with anything like that. But, yes, \nI do know it. And then, they attempt to intimidate the examiner \nor to claim that when the examiner will make a protest, they \nwill go after the examiner. And they make phone calls to the \nbranch chief and his manager and higher. These things do occur.\n    Senator Mack. And the intimidation that you experience is I \nguess, what, the understanding of the personal relationship \nthat that individual has from his previous experience with the \nmanager or the case?\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. Oh, they do. They will make phone calls. They \nwill go to your manager. They will go to your branch chief. \nThis is a very common practice.\n    Senator Mack. Let me go next to Mr. Ayala, is it?\n    Mr. Ayala. Ayala.\n    Senator Mack. In your testimony, you talked about a study \nranking property seizures.\n    Mr. Ayala. Yes, that is correct.\n    Senator Mack. And I understand that that study, that should \nnot be done. Is that correct?\n    Mr. Ayala. Yes, it is a violation of a Policy Statement P1-\n20 which states that enforcement statistics, such as levies, \nseizures, summons cannot be used to rate performance of any \nkind.\n    Senator Mack. Do you have a copy of that?\n    Mr. Ayala. Yes, I do. I have a copy of that here.\n    Senator Mack. Senator Roth, do we already have a copy of \nthat for the record? Or if not, I would like to have it \nincluded in the record.\n    The Chairman. Without objection."
break,break,break,break
"","","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Senator Mack. All right. And what is the date of that? Is \nthat something that has been done since September of last year?\n    Mr. Ayala. The graphs showing the number of seizures per \nrevenue officer and per district are dated January 12th of \n1998. Some of the statements in there talk about the district's \nrange from a low of 1.2 seizures per revenue officer in the \nsouth of Florida to a high of 2.47 in Georgia, Delaware, and \nMaryland. The district improved from the lowest number of \nseizures per revenue officer in fiscal year 96 to seventh in \nfiscal year 97. In Georgia, they exceeded the regional average \nfor all fiscal year 97 and finished the year at 2.47 seizures \nper revenue officer.\n    Senator Mack. And that would substantiate in a way Ms. \nJohnson's comments that IRS management has openly flaunted the \nfact that it is not concerned with the Finance Committee \nhearings. Would you agree?\n    Mr. Ayala. I would say it is business as usual. They will \ncome up with some excuse of why this was done. However, it does \nattach evaluative measures and compare performance-wise. And it \nis a violation of Policy Statement P1-20 and the Taxpayer Bill \nof Rights.\n    Senator Mack. I thank you.\n    If I may, Mr. Chairman, ask just one?\n    The Chairman. Please.\n    Senator Mack. Ms. Jarvis, I want to ask you some questions \nrelated to the case that you referred to on your first page. \nAnd you say, ``At the sole discretion of the individual \nmanagers, millions, even hundreds of millions of dollars of tax \nrevenues owed to the U.S. Treasury by some of the largest \ntaxpayers in this country are literally forgiven, zeroed out.''\n    Ms. Jarvis. Yes, sir, that is correct.\n    Senator Mack. Is that, do they have sole discretion to do \nthat?\n    Ms. Jarvis. Yes, sir, they do. As a matter of fact, I \nwitnessed a branch chief comment the other day, well, I guess \nit was about two weeks ago to an agent.\n    Senator Mack. Help me for a minute, because----\n    Ms. Jarvis. Oh, we are agents.\n    Senator Mack. I need to get a sense of this organization. \nWhere does this individual fit into this thing? How much power \nis that?\n    Ms. Jarvis. Two levels up.\n    Senator Mack. Okay.\n    Ms. Jarvis. I have a direct manager. Then, this other \nperson is my current branch chief commented to another agent \nthat management has supreme authority.\n    Senator Mack. I can respect that somebody has to, you know, \nultimately make the decision.\n    Ms. Jarvis. Above that is an assistant chief of exam, a \nchief of exam, a district director, and assistant district \ndirector.\n    Senator Mack. All right. So where does this person fall?\n    Ms. Jarvis. About four levels down.\n    Senator Mack. Yes. All right. So that individual four \nlevels down has the sole discretion about whether to zero out \nor not?\n    Ms. Jarvis. It goes below. It goes to the immediate case \nmanager, my manager.\n    Senator Mack. All right.\n    Ms. Jarvis. On that particular case.\n    Senator Mack. Can you appeal that?\n    Ms. Jarvis. Yes, sir. I have written letters. And I have \nspoken to the branch chief of the section. I was thrown out of \nthat, off the case. I was thrown out of that group. And I was \nthrown out of that branch which is a tremendous disgrace.\n    Up until all of that had happened, I had received awards, \nspecial act awards for the work that I had done, and for my \ncontribution to my duty. Another branch chief had commented \nthat my manager was in collusion with the taxpayer.\n    And no one will discuss it with me, no one. They all say to \nme it is someone else's responsibility. There is no place for \nus to turn. And I feel great compassion for regional inspection \nbecause they report right back to the people that I am \ncomplaining about.\n    Senator Mack. I thank you very much. Again, I appreciate \nthe information that all of you have given us.\n    I wonder if it would be appropriate if I just direct a \nthought or a question to my colleague, Senator Kerrey. You have \ndone great work in this. You have been a lot more involved in \nit than I have.\n    But this concept of zeroing out, I have a sense that when \nthat individual makes that decision to zero out, somewhere \nalong the line, somebody else has to approve that. I mean, I \ncannot imagine that much authority rests in such a low level I \nguess is what I am saying without some kind of oversight. Are \nyou familiar with it at all?"
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    I am not familiar with it.\n    Senator Mack. All right. I think we ought to look at that I \nguess. When I was a lending officer in a bank, each of us has, \nis given authority as to how much, how large a loan we can make \nwith anybody else's approval. Eventually, they actually run \npast the board and the board has to approve it, but on a day-\nto-day basis, we have certain authority.\n    And it would seen to me that there ought to be, if there is \nnot, some formal process, some formal identification of the \nauthority of the individual to make decisions up to whatever \nlevel that we want to design."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    I can tell you, Senator, one of the things \nthat we did hear from both employees and from management is \nthat there is an attempt, not just for the IRS, but in most \nother public and private organizations to push the \ndecisionmaking authority further out along the lines so that \nyou do not get into a situation where a decision cannot be \nmade. It has to be going back up the line. It is very \nfrustrating to have somebody say, I cannot make a decision.\n    Indeed, one of the earlier restructuring plans that the IRS \nhad was pulling more and more of the decisionmaking back up \ninto----\n    Senator Mack. I am not suggesting that we push the decision \nback, but I am saying that we be very clear in the authority, \nwho has the authority to do what, how large a case can they \nzero out.\n    So again, if you would be willing to work with me on that, \nI would like to.\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. Excuse me."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Yes, sir.\n    Senator Mack. Yes.\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. Doesn't there have to be a reason for zeroing \nit out?\n    Senator Mack. Well, I would think that would come with the \nauthority, yes.\n    Ms. O'Dwyer. Yes, but see, it is done to meet a deadline \nand for statistical goals. In my particular case, he said he \nhad the authority of the branch chief behind him which he did. \nHis branch chief was his very good friend. And upper management \nbecame aware of it and over him, over the branch chief. And the \nresponse was, my, even if we--why did this happen? Even if we \ngot a portion of the tax, it would have been something. That \nwas the only comment.\n    Senator Mack. All right. Thank you.\n    The Chairman. Well, let me say this discussion does raise a \nvery serious question of checks and balances, one that has to \nbe addressed. I am so pleased that Commissioner Rossotti is a \nmanagement expert, and he can certainly help address these \nproblems.\n    This is a problem of not only writing the law, but a \nproblem of creating the kinds of checks and balances over \nmanagement that are needed to ensure propriety of actions and \naccountability for said actions.\n    Let me say to this group again that I want to thank you for \nbeing here. It outrages me that each of you have to come here \nfearing retaliation. It is your responsibility as an employee \nand as a citizen to come forward and tell it as it is and as \nyou see it.\n    And I applaud you for what you do. Again, like Senator \nMoynihan said, if you have any problems, please call us. I \nrealize that is not a total answer.\n    I think Senator Gramm is right. I recognize that in many \ncases, some IRS officials over there say, well, just wait, you \nknow, commissioners come and go. Senators come and go. And so \nthat is a problem, but I applaud you for what you are doing. \nAnd please, if you have problems, let us know. Thank you all \nvery much.\n    We will now proceed to the next panel."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Yes, sir."
"kerrey","Senator Kerrey","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Yesterday, I raised the issue of waivers of \nwitnesses. And since that time, I do not know who sent it to \nyou. The Chief Counsel, Stuart Brown sent you, Mr. Chairman, \nand Senator Moynihan a letter detailing why that waiver would \nbe difficult to grant. In other words, why Mr. Rossotti would \nhave trouble talking about it tomorrow when he comes forward.\n    And I just want for the record to say this satisfies my \nconcerns. I think it is important for the public to understand \nthat there is a law called section 6103 that not only says a \ntaxpayer can come and talk about the return, but the IRS cannot \nunless there is a right of waiver granted.\n    And in this case there was multiple taxpayers. There is \nalso rules of grand jury secrecy that is referenced in this \nletter. And I do accept what the chief counsel of the \nDepartment of Treasury is saying. And I will not press this \nissue further.\n    The Chairman. We will now proceed to the next group of \nwitnesses. These witnesses include current and former employees \nof the Criminal Investigation Division of the Internal Revenue \nService. They will testify before us today about the serious \nabuses they have witnessed taking place both within CID as well \nas publicly involving taxpayers.\n    These witnesses will also address the unfair treatment they \nhave experienced in the hands of their own colleagues while \nthey struggled to deal honestly and fairly with IRS employees \nand the taxpaying public.\n    In addition, they will also provide us with testimony \ndisclosing an actual case when an entire IRS story was a \nfabrication of lies to entrap an innocent but highly public \nfigure in order for an employee to gain improved performance \nratings on the job.\n    It is our practice in these hearings to ask each witness to \nbe sworn.

"","","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","   STATEMENT OF TOMMY A."
break,break,break,break
"","","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Mr. Henderson. Thank you, sir. Mr. Chairman, my name is Tom \nHenderson. And I have been a special agent with the Criminal \nInvestigation Division, Internal Revenue Service, IRS for over \n25 years.\n    I graduated from the University of West Florida in \nPensacola, Florida in June of 1972 with a degree in economics \nand began my career as a special agent in Orlando, Florida \nimmediately after graduation.\n    I was also a group manager for the Criminal Investigation \nDivision, CID, in Knoxville, Tennessee from 1983 until 1989.\n    I would like to share some of my experiences as a group \nmanager in the Knoxville office with you today. But, first, I \nwant to say that most of the employees and many of the managers \nwithin the Internal Revenue Service are hardworking Americans \ndoing a very difficult job under adverse conditions.\n    Their job is complicated by an IRS management which is out \nof control and operating under a separate set of standards from \nthe vast majority of the employees. The arrogance, \nvindictiveness, incompetence, and lack of ethics by certain \nmanagers and management officials and management in general are \na major detriment to IRS employees as well as American \ntaxpayers.\n    IRS management does what it wants, to whom it wants, when \nit wants, how it wants with almost complete immunity. Each \ndistrict director and chief appears to operate his own little \nkingdom and in some instances with little regard for the law \nand/or government rules and regulations.\n    Management then uses the unlimited resources of the Federal \nGovernment, that is taxpayer funds to cover up its acts and to \ndestroy its opponents whether they be employees or taxpayers.\n    The greatest problem within the IRS today is that \nmanagement has no accountability. When an IRS manager makes bad \ndecisions, violates government rules and regulations, and/or \nviolates the law, that person is usually promoted or the \nsituation is covered up.\n    Shortly after being selected as the acting group manager in \nKnoxville, Tennessee, I arrived to start my new job. I arrived \nin Knoxville late in the evening at the same time the agents \nand chief of the Criminal Investigation Division were having a \nparty at a local hotel.\n    Everyone was completely intoxicated. And my initial \nconversation with the chief occurred in his motel room with him \nso intoxicated he could not stand. This should have been a sign \nof things to come. However, I was young, naive, and \nenthusiastic. This would soon change.\n    I learned that the chief for the Criminal Investigation \nDivision for the Nashville District which included all of \nTennessee frequently showed up at outlying posts of duty like \nKnoxville with a car load of liquor in the trunk of his \ngovernment car. He would then insist that the agents and \nmanagers join him in his motel room where significant amounts \nof alcohol were consumed.\n    The gathering would then adjourn to a local bar. However, \nthat bar had to have facilities to serve food so the agents \ncould justify driving their government cars to that location. \nThe eating, drinking, dancing, and whatever would continue \nuntil the late evening. I found that some of my agents on \nseveral occasions were so drunk they could not find their \ngovernment cars.\n    It should be noted that the chief was famous throughout the \nSoutheast Region for this behavior. And it was also well known \nby the upper management circles. I was eventually able to put a \nhalt to this practice while simultaneously contributing to my \nown demise.\n    I quickly learned that the chief ran the district like his \nown private police force. There are numerous instances that I \ncan relate which demonstrate corrupt practices within the \nInternal Revenue Service. However, one experience in Knoxville \nstands out about all the rest. This experience ultimately \nresulted in my leaving IRS management and confirmed my distrust \nof management and the entire IRS system.\n    As the months passed, I began having some serious problems \nand misgivings concerning one of the senior agents assigned to \nmy group. He was a close friend and drinking buddy of the chief \nof the Criminal Investigation Division and had been in the \ndistrict for a number of years.\n    For more than 2 years, I had consistently expressed my \nconcern to the chief of the Criminal Investigation Division \nthat the senior special agent had a problem with alcohol and \nwas allegedly disclosing tax and grand jury information in \nlocal bars in and around Johnson City, Tennessee area.\n    I also reported that he had conducted an authorized \ngambling and undercover investigation where he made bets after \nbeing told not to do so. I learned of this unauthorized \ninvestigation when he attempted to get reimbursed for his \ngambling losses from the IRS impress fund.\n    He was also arrested for driving while intoxicated while \noperating a government vehicle which resulted in the suspension \nof his driver's license. His conduct was covered up at the time \nby the chief of the Criminal Investigation Division.\n    In May of 1989, the agent's conduct reached intolerable \nproportions. He was intoxicated on the job for at least a week. \nDuring this period, the agent called me with information that a \nsitting U.S. Congressman and former U.S. Senator were involved \nin a bribery and money laundering operation.\n    I immediately called the chief of the Criminal \nInvestigation Division with that information. According to the \nagent, the sitting United States Congressman and former U.S. \nSenator were both receiving $300,000 to $400,000 in currency \nevery month for a period of seven years from a well-known \nnational company for favorable legislation and/or political \nconsiderations.\n    The agent without authorization transmitted the information \nto the United States Attorney's office in Greenville, Tennessee \nand to the FBI. As a senior IRS special agent, he was \nattempting to establish a grand jury investigation without any \nauthorization.\n    Before disclosing any information, the authorization to \nnumber the investigation was needed from the group manager, \nchief of the Criminal Investigation, and the national office in \nWashington since the investigation would involve a sitting \nUnited States Congressman.\n    Had it been true, this obviously would have been an \nenormous case of national importance and a tremendous boost to \nthe agent's career. After I had some time to review my notes \nand consider the situation and the performance of the agent, I \nhad another senior special agent verify the information with \nthe alleged informant. From that I learned that all the \ninformation was bogus.\n    What I had uncovered was an attempt to create an unfounded \ncriminal investigation on two national political figures for no \nreason other than to redeem the agent's own career and \ningratiate himself with his superiors.\n    Incredibly, this entire situation was also covered up by \nthe chief and assistant chief of the Criminal Investigation \nDivision and later by the district director.\n    On June 1st, 1989, after I had discovered the agent's \nactivities, I informed the assistant chief that the agent was \nout of control, that I believed him to be dangerous to himself, \nto the public, and to the Internal Revenue Service.\n    I recommended that we take his gun and credentials and \nplace him on leave until he could receive professional help. I \nhad seen this happen once before to a prominent political \nfigure when I was a new agent and I was not going to let it \nhappen again.\n    This time, I was the immediate supervisor and it was my \nresponsibility to take action. However, I was told by the \nassistant chief to say and do nothing. I was then informed that \nI was the one in trouble and was refused any information from \nthe assistant chief.\n    This was the second time in my career that I had discovered \nwhat appeared to be criminal conduct by a special agent. And \nagain, for the second time, I was being threatened for doing \nwhat was right.\n    On June 2nd, 1989, I had a conversation with an FBI \nsupervisor who was familiar with the situation. The FBI \nsupervisor stated that the agent was, and I quote, a 110 \npercent alcoholic and a security risk.\n    On June 5th, 1989, I was called to the chief's office and \naccused of numerous things. I was told that the entire \nKnoxville group had lost faith in my management, the whole \ngroup wanted me removed as group manager. I realized that the \nchief and assistant chief were going to again cover up the \nagent's activities.\n    I decided to resign my position as group manager because I \nwas afraid that anything less could subject me to both criminal \nand civil liability. I had previously discussed in theoretical \nterms my possible liability with an attorney.\n    I was angry and hurt by management's lack of ethics and \nsupport and resigned from the position of group manager with \nthe understanding that I would be transferred back to Florida. \nI knew that if I did not get out of the Nashville District, I \nwould be fired or forced to resign on some trumped up charge.\n    I later learned that the chief and assistant chief had lied \nand that the whole situation was being orchestrated by the \nagent in question, along with the chief and assistant chief. \nThe chief of the Criminal Investigation Division then created a \ncover story for my resignation from management in which he \nincluded praise during the announcement to the Knoxville group.\n    Shortly after my resignation, the chief and assistant chief \nwith the help of others began a harassment campaign against me \nwhich I now know to be standard operating procedure within the \nInternal Revenue Service.\n    First, I was isolated from my group. I was not even allowed \nwithin my own group's office space. Secondly, I was ostracized \nby my fellow employees at the direction of the chief and \nassistant chief. Third, and the most devastating of all, my \ncase inventory and ability to work as a successful special \nagent were destroyed.\n    Management creates a self fulfilling prophecy where an \nemployee cannot succeed and is either forced to resign or be \nfired. The only relief for an employee or a taxpayer at odds \nwith a corrupt IRS management is the Federal district court. \nUnfortunately, most of us have neither the time nor the money \nto fight the United States Government.\n    It seems that almost overnight a senior agent and former \ngroup manager can no longer do anything right. I had violated \nan unwritten law. I had exposed the illegal actions of another \nagent. What I had indeed done was break up a false criminal \ncase against two national political figures that would have \nbeen disastrous for them as well as the Internal Revenue \nService.\n    After resigning as group manager, I started doing what I \nknew best, finding and working significant criminal cases. I \ndeveloped two significant criminal cases in Gatlinburg, \nTennessee while I was waiting to be transferred to Florida, \nthis pursuant to my agreement with the chief of the Criminal \nInvestigation Division.\n    I developed both cases to the point that I needed \nassistance in conducting surveillance and executing search \nwarrants. As soon as the chief realized that I had developed \ntwo significant cases, the first case was reassigned to a \nfellow agent in the Knoxville office and the second was \ndropped.\n    The first case was completed by the new agent. And the case \nwas written up in the Criminal Investigation Digest with other \nsignificant cases. My participation was never mentioned.\n    I considered the second case which required more work the \nmore significant of the two. I had obtained information for the \nsecond case from the FBI espionage files. It related to a store \nbeing operated by an alleged Iranian intelligence cell in \nGatlinburg, Tennessee which was allegedly funneling money to \nIranian terrorists.\n    I had determined their method of skimming funds from the \nbusiness they were operating. In addition, one of the subjects \nof the investigation was allegedly one of the Iranians \nresponsible for holding the Americans hostage in Iran.\n    I could not believe that the IRS management was so \ndesperate to destroy my credibility that they would drop this \ninvestigation. I now know that investigations, specifically \nones conducted by agents no longer in management's favor \nregardless of their importance or how much money, taxpayer's \nmoney have been invested or the ethics involved mean absolutely \nnothing.\n    I was subsequently detailed out of the district to Tampa, \nFlorida. There I spent numerous weeks on what I can only \ndescribe as a vacation at government expense since I was \nneither required or expected to do much work. Meanwhile, my \nfamily was being threatened. And the Internal Revenue Service \nrefused any assistance.\n    It was after my resignation as group manager that I learned \nthat the agent who conducted these illegal investigations had \nbeen involved in numerous other activities which had been \ncovered up by the chief and assistant chief.\n    These included sexual harassment of a female special agent, \nattempted rape of another female special agent, unauthorized \ndisclosure of tax and grand jury information, allegedly being \ndrunk and pointed out FBI agents to criminal elements, \nthreatening fellow agents, burglarizing a mini storage \nwarehouse to obtain drugs, illegal electronic monitoring, \nbragging in bars that hew as going to get a U.S. Congressman \nand a Tennessee State district attorney, and association with \nknown criminal elements.\n    Both the United States Congressman and the State district \nattorney were well aware of the agent's activities. And I had \nan opportunity to discuss the situation with the Congressman \nafter my resignation.\n    I do not believe that the retired United States Senator \nuntil recently was aware of the attempt to investigate him.\n    The agent who generated all these problems and more was \nsubsequently fired, no, not because of all the previous acts I \nhave outlined. He was eventually fired only because he was \narrested on a cocaine charge by the sheriff's office. And being \npublic knowledge, it was impossible to cover up.\n    I managed to secure my transfer back to Florida where I \nagain became a productive special agent. However, two employees \nleft behind were not so fortunate. The first was Barbara \nLatham, my former assistant at the time and a tax fraud \ninvestigative aide.\n    Her only crime was that she refused to ostracize me at the \ndirection of the chief and assistant chief and new group \nmanager. She subsequently was literally railroaded out of her \njob and both her physical and financial health destroyed. \nHowever, Barbara can best describe what happened to her.\n    The second was special agent Patty Gernt. She made the \nmistake of turning the agent into the Inspection Division as \nrequired under the code of conduct. I believe she was harassed \nand ultimately railroaded out of her job simply to set an \nexample for anyone else who even thought about crossing \nmanagement.\n    After my resignation, I learned that special agent Gernt \nwas being threatened, assaulted, and abused by this agent. The \nabuse continued at the hands of the chief, the assistant chief, \nand new group manager after my return to Florida. Patty can \nbest describe her treatment and what happens to you when you go \nagainst the IRS power of structure.\n    The three of us were dedicated, hard working government \nemployees who could not tolerate the terrible abuse of power \nagainst innocent people. Barbara and Patty have paid a terrible \nprice for their honesty and convictions.\n    I am testifying here today at personal risk for all my \nfellow employees and taxpayers. It is imperative that \nsituations like the one I have described never ever happen \nagain. And everyone within the Internal Revenue Service, \nespecially its management abide by the same rules, ethical and \nlegal standards that govern and guide us all. Thank you, sir.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Henderson.\n    Ms. Gernt."

break,break,break,break
"","","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Ms. Gernt. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, members of this \ncommittee, my name is Patricia Gernt. I am a former special \nagent out of the Nashville District Criminal Investigation \nDivision of the Internal Revenue Service. I graduated from East \nTennessee State University with concentrations in accounting, \nbiology, and chemistry. In 1987, I became an employee of the \nIRS.\n    At that time, for me the job was a dream come true, an \nopportunity to work for my country. I believed I would be \ncarrying out the duties and mission of the Internal Revenue \nService in enforcing the tax laws of this country.\n    However, as an employee of the IRS, I was also witness to \nincidents of extreme fraud, abuse, and waste of the taxpayer's \nhard earned money. I soon learned that abuse of these revenues \nwas considered general operating procedure and certainly a way \nof life within the Criminal Investigation Division.\n    Before continuing, I want to be very clear in noting the \ndevotion and loyalty of many IRS employees who are hard workers \nfulfilling the public's trust in performing often difficult \njobs.\n    But I as well as other employees found out far too quickly \nthe IRS management operates under a separate set of standards \nand is virtually untouchable because it is not simply held \naccountable for its actions either by the national office or by \nCongress. I make this declaration with specific knowledge of \nincidents and further state that it is more the rule than the \nexception.\n    Members of management foster an atmosphere of retaliation, \nsexual harassment, fear, and arrogance in its employees to \nassure loyalty to themselves. Regrettably, there is little \nconcern at all about the application of the taxpayer's dollars \nin funding the agency or indulging their own behavior.\n    Early my career, a former special agent who was my on-the-\njob instructor, an OJI, became involved in an extremely serious \nmisconduct. He was arrested for driving a government vehicle \nwhile intoxicated, this according to the local Johnson City, \nTennessee police department.\n    Although I am now personally aware of my former group \nmanager Tommy Henderson's efforts to control this agent's \nrenegade behavior, no other IRS administrative action was taken \nagainst him.\n    This agent was well known for his repeated outbursts \ndisclosing protected tax and grand jury information in local \nbars in and around the Johnson City, Tennessee area. He was \nnever once reprimanded by management for this outrageous and \nclearly career ending type of behavior.\n    Specifically, it was this same agent who threatened a \nseated Congressman, a former Senator, and a local Tennessee \ndistrict attorney with criminal prosecution, publicly labeling \nthem as, quote, crooks.\n    While he continued as my mentor, this special agent \nrequested me to perform activities clearly outside of the IRS \ncode. Among these demands on me were demands for sexual favors. \nHe would often apologize later, but that was always followed by \nhis telling me, you know, I can make you or break you in this \njob. I feared him because of his constant sexual harassment and \ncertainly due to his position as a senior special agent.\n    I did not know at that time that I was not alone in this \nfear. I later learned that he had attempted to rape another \nfemale special agent just a few years prior to my arrival with \nthe agency.\n    You may be wondering if things were so bad, why didn't I \nsay anything to anyone? Why didn't I complain? Well, therein \nlies the heart of the problem.\n    To begin with, I was still a new employee with little \ninfluence or authority. I knew that management had been \ninformed of that earlier incident involving a special agent and \nhad chosen not to take adversary action against him for the \nassault.\n    In fact, the only relief provided this woman was from the \nnew group manager, special agent Tommy Henderson. He was able \nto secure an assurance that the agent would never be allowed to \nwork along with her on future cases.\n    Because the Nashville IRS management clearly ignored the \nwidely circulated reports about this special agent, including \nhis drinking problems, revoked driver's license, misbehavior \naround female co-workers, and dipping into IRS funds to \ncompensate for his personal gambling losses, management had set \nthe stage where I then found myself standing dead center and \nalone.\n    Certainly, this agent had serious personal problems. And I \ntook the brunt for much of it. However, I want to be very clear \non one point. And it is a major one. This agent needed help.\n    He had serious personal problems. Yet his own managers \npreferred to ignore the situation and sweep these breaches of \nprofessional conduct under what was becoming a very large rug.\n    By far the greater breach in professionalism was committed \nby a management that was clearly less interested in dealing \nwith poor conduct than with the possibility of this agent's \nactually pulling in the big case.\n    By avoiding having to admit to a potential agency mess with \nthe agent, management inadvertently chose to let him take a \nroad that would ultimately lead to his tragic final fall.\n    In 1989, I broke my silence and shared my problems with \ngroup manager Tommy Henderson. Surprisingly, when he made my \nconcerns relative to this renegade agent known to management, \nan investigation was instituted. However, of even greater \nastonishment was that the agent was not to be the target of \nthis investigation, Tommy Henderson and I were.\n    For nearly 1 year, I was the target of an unrelenting \ninternal investigation by the IRS management. My neighbors were \nquestioned about me. I was followed by co-workers, incidentally \nwho were also special agents acting outside the scope of their \nauthority. My college transcripts were even pulled along with \nmy tax returns and my divorce transcripts. I was even followed \nto the restroom.\n    It was during this investigation of Mr. Henderson and me \nthat I became so stressed that for the first time in my life I \nsought professional counseling. All during this ridiculous and \nunproductive investigation, I continually tried to reassure \nmanagement that all I wanted was an equal chance in the work \nplace, but absent sexual harassment and threats of retaliation \nor retribution, not too much to ask for I thought.\n    What eventually happened to the special agent, my former \nmentor, was indeed pitiful. He was never fired by IRS \nmanagement for sexual harassment nor for verbal threats against \ntaxpayers nor for creating false cases against a Congressman, \nformer Senator, or a Tennessee district attorney.\n    It ultimately took a local police agency catching the agent \nand his cousin outside of the IRS domain with cocaine, scales, \nand other drug paraphernalia to get the IRS management to \nterminate him. The agent's behavior was now in the public eye. \nAnd the IRS could no longer cover for him. Management's hands \nwere finally tied, but only by the scrutiny of the public's \nknowledge.\n    For me, the final blow came in 1993. An incident occurred \nwithin the Knoxville Criminal Investigation Division office \nwhere a special agent had lost her service weapon. She had \nreported it missing on February 5th, 1993 from a storage safe \nto which only she had the keys. However, days after she \nannounced the weapon was missing, it was reported recovered \nfrom bushes located next to a restaurant that she and \ncolleagues had frequented while conducting a search warrant.\n    Of paramount interest is that the particular search had \nbeen conducted on New Year's Eve over 1 month prior to her \nannouncement that the weapon was missing. Although it was \nfound, all Criminal Investigation Division employees including \nme were questioned about its disappearance.\n    However, for 2 days in March, I was interrogated by my \nmanager and was then informed I had to, quote, clear myself of \npotential charges of theft or complicity. Although I explained \nthat I worked over 120 miles away from the scene of the missing \nweapon, I did not have keys to either the Knoxville building or \nthe CID premises, all reasons I felt were strong indicators of \nmy innocence. I was now clearly the scapegoat to relieve the \nspecial agent of blame in losing her weapon.\n    As a result of having to clear myself, I obtained a \ncriminal defense attorney. Prior to meeting with the IRS in \nKnoxville, Tennessee, my attorney and I agreed we would both \ncarry recorders into the meeting.\n    When we arrived, both devices were in plain view. As we \nattempted to enter the CID offices, the group manager became \noutraged at my attorney's presence and physically shoved him \ntwice.\n    When I attempted to leave their office, the same group \nmanager came after me and struck me in the stomach. It was \ncrystal clear to me at that point that management was going to \nprotect its own and I was on my own. I was now branded a self-\nserving whistle blower by management and colleagues.\n    In 1993 having blown the whistle numerous times on a number \nof matters, I summoned the courage to drive seven hours in my \nown vehicle to Washington, DC hoping against hope I could get \nsomeone to listen to me at the national office.\n    What I ran up against was an IRS Commissioner who refused \nto see me and a head of CID who deflected me to one of his \nassistants. The assistant appeared unmoved about what he was \nhearing from me. I received no help that day.\n    To me the national office clearly had no interest in \nknowing about the chaos in Knoxville, Tennessee. But then again \nperhaps, all this was not at all new news to them.\n    I soon became seriously ill, both physically and \nemotionally. I assured management that I truly cared and wanted \nto get past all this and continue a career with the agency, but \nI could not endure the untenable conditions they had created in \nthe work place.\n    With no consideration of the quality years I worked, their \nresponse to my request was termination with retirement just 4 \nyears ago this month. Finally, just last year after 4 years of \nlegal battling, a suit that I initiated against the Internal \nRevenue Service in 1994 was resolved in an out-of-court \nsettlement.\n    Before I conclude my testimony, I would like to take this \nopportunity to mention another practice within the IRS that is \nof significant concern to me.\n    While not directly related to the main subject of my \ntestimony, I would appreciate having a moment to address it.\n    The Chairman. Please proceed.\n    Ms. Gernt. In many situations when CID numbers or opens a \ncase on an individual, they will also number family members, \nsuch as a spouse, son, daughter, etcetera.\n    Often in the end as part of a plea agreement with the \nprimary subject, the IRS will negotiate to drop cases on the \nother family members if the primary target will plead to all \ncharges at the initiation of the negotiating phase.\n    Or in other instances, CID may threaten at the initiation \nof an investigation to number family members. Threats of \nspouses are most common. And then, because these threats \ninvolve innocent parties, the primary taxpayer will negotiate a \nplea.\n    In addition to this, the number of other related cases \nboasts the IRS' statistics and CID. So by numbering the primary \nindividual, the spouse, son, daughter, uncle, etcetera, the \nagent shows a hefty inventory of cases. We refer to these as \nrelated or spin-off cases.\n    The agent gets accolades and the manager has a full case \nload inventory which boasts his evaluations. CID looks on a \nnational or district level as though it is bursting at the \nseams with cases when in fact most of those cases numbered will \nbe dropped or referred to another division of IRS, but never \nworked to the end with a report of prosecution by the Criminal \nInvestigation Division.\n    We have all read that the new IRS Commissioner is \nattempting to pursue a newly corrected course for this agency. \nThere are many dedicated and honest employees who are looking \nto him for his straight and unimpeded guidance.\n    They simply want to know they can count on him for support \nwhen they do their jobs the right way, the honest way, and when \nthey defy the abusive behavior of so many in management \npositions. On the other hand, there are employees who do not \nappreciate his efforts to correct the business as usual \nmentality.\n    I hope that what I have shared with you today will shed \nsome light on what I believe are egregious conditions in which \nhonest, public servants of the Internal Revenue Service are \nforced to endure in executing their jobs. I greatly appreciate \nthis opportunity to appear before you today. Thank you.\n    The Chairman. And we greatly appreciate your being here. \nThank you.\n    And now, I will call upon Ms. Latham."

break,break,break,break
"","","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Ms. Latham. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name \nis Barbara Latham. I was an employee of the Nashville, \nTennessee District of the Internal Revenue Service for almost \n17 years, 12 of them in the Criminal Investigation Division as \na tax fraud investigative aide. It was a job that required me \nto render assistance to 12 special agents and a group manager \nin the investigation and persecution of cases of tax fraud.\n    There is a long history of dishonesty, chaos, and abuse of \ngovernment time and funds in the CID work place among both \nmanagement officials and employees. The waste and abuse is out \nof control.\n    During my career with the IRS, I witnessed many incidents \nof extreme fraud and abuse and waste of the taxpayer's money in \nthe operation of this division of IRS. They operate under a \ndifferent set of standards than other IRS employees.\n    The Criminal Investigation Division applies scant control \nover special agents, many of whom will not work under any \ncircumstances. The special agents focus their investigations on \nsmaller businessmen with smaller tax liabilities because they \nrequire less work than investigations involving larger tax \ndeficiencies or serious criminal offenses.\n    They frequently increase statistics for work load \ninventories by opening five or six related investigations and \nclosing them at the same time for lack of resources or \ninsufficient personnel to work the cases.\n    The Criminal Investigation Division does not need more \nmoney. They need to use the money they have more wisely. They \nhave all the investigative tools they need and unlimited funds \nof the taxpayers' hard earned dollars, but they fail to collect \nmillions of dollars in delinquent taxes and manipulate those \nstatistics to reflect otherwise.\n    When a number is used as an indicator of success, everyone \nwill try to inflate that number as much as possible. Tommy \nHenderson from whom you have just heard became group manager of \nthe Knoxville, Tennessee IRS Criminal Investigation Division in \n1983.\n    He was excellent supervisor, well liked, and respected for \nhis fairness to his subordinates. A conspiracy to remove group \nmanager Tommy Henderson began in 1989 after he attempted to \nhave a special agent under his supervision disciplined for \nmisconduct.\n    Rather than risking embarrassment to themselves by \nprosecuting his allegations of sexual harassment, alcoholism, \ndrugs, and fraud that had been so long repressed, IRS officials \npressured Tommy Henderson into resigning from management.\n    After his resignation, Henderson was subjected to a \ncampaign of ostracism, harassment, and retaliation intended to \nforce him out of his job. When I refused to obey a direct order \nfrom the CID chief and Henderson's replacement to shun \nHenderson, I began to suffer different treatment which I \nmanaged to ignore out of fear for the safety of my job.\n    In January 1993, I suddenly found myself a middle-aged \ngrandmother with an exemplary work record and impeccable \nreputation caught up in a patronage scheme to protect one \nimmoral female when she reported that her service weapon had \nbeen stolen.\n    The truth was she had lost it, but preferred to accuse a \nco-worker, special agent Patricia Gernt who worked at a post of \nduty more than 120 miles away. Just days after the gun was \nreported missing, it was recovered under mysterious \ncircumstances.\n    It was found by an employee of a fast food restaurant in a \nwet and rusted condition more than 100 miles from the IRS \noffice. It also happened to be next door to a business where \nthe special agent had assisted in a search warrant a month \nbefore.\n    It was simply not credible that the gun had been stolen. \nAll evidence pointed to the gun having been carelessly lost. \nNot even Houdini himself were he alive today could have removed \nthe gun from the locked cabinets with no signs of forced entry.\n    After the gun had been recovered, IRS officials set out on \nwhat can only be described as an after-the-fact witch hunt \nunder the guise of an investigation. It seemed more important \nto conduct this type of investigation against employees than it \nwas to pursue persons who may defraud the government out of \nlegitimately owed tax dollars.\n    Patricia Gernt and I became the targets in the ensuing sham \ninvestigation. These pseudo investigations resemble a court \nmartial in that they are basically closed proceedings, not \nsubject to outside scrutiny. The catalyst for my involvement \nappeared to be my refusal to falsely implicate Patricia Gernt \nin any act of misconduct.\n    For my refusal, I was forced to work in a hostile and \nabusive work environment. I felt like I was being punished \ndaily. My physical and mental health deteriorated. I endured 3 \nyears of what can only be described as IRS hell.\n    I was even expected to participate in raids along side \nheavily armed agents wearing protective vests. The only \ndifference was I given no vest, no weapon, or any other \nprotection. This was clearly against IRS policy and was not at \nall what I had envisioned I would be doing in my career at the \nage of 60. I got the message and opted for early retirement in \nSeptember 1996.\n    It is the practice of the IRS Inspection Division to use \nGestapo-type tactics to intimidate and harass the targets of \ntheir investigations. They coerce them into giving false \nevidence and then offer them immunity in exchange for it. These \nemployees are forced to provide false evidence of criminal \nmisconduct against innocent colleagues included on the IRS hit \nlist.\n    As a pretext to an investigation, the IRS Inspection \nDivision subjected Patty Gernt and me to polygraphs and \nhandwriting analysis. They also conducted interrogations during \nwhich they tried to get me to implicate her in the theft of the \ngun.\n    Monitoring devices were placed on my telephone at my home \nand in my work place. My activities were monitored both in and \naway from the work place. And anonymous phone calls were made \nto the Office of the Inspector General accusing me of tax \nfraud.\n    Both of us were denied access to documents. And files were \nshredded so that no paper trail existed of this harassment and \nretaliation.\n    The fiasco of the missing gun grew out of proportion and \nbecame a nightmare. Special agents were diverted from their \ncases and other employees kept from performing their jobs.\n    The controversy surrounding the investigation continued for \nmore than 3 years and cost the taxpayers close to $1 million, \nincluding more than $100,000 in legal fees paid to two private \nattorneys hired to defend the supervisor, 3 years of lost \nmanpower for more than a dozen employees and hundreds of \nthousands of dollars to settle employee complaints.\n    In the end, the total cost of this case to the taxpayers, \nincluding the resulting personnel disputes and all of the \ncoverups of unethical conduct in the work place was in the \nmillions of dollars.\n    There is no one in our society more powerful than the IRS. \nThey assume they are above the law and do not have to obey the \nlaws applied to private individuals. They have the power over \nthe lives of citizens that is theirs by virtue of their \nintimate knowledge of every single one of us.\n    Not even employees are immune from attack. Workers are \nafraid to voice concerns for fear of reprisal. Employees should \nbe allowed to voice their opinions and to make those in power \naware of what is happening to them and how their constitutional \nrights are being violated. It is time that the IRS is held \naccountable for their actions and performance.\n    Senator Roth, thank you for this opportunity to appear \nbefore your committee today.\n    The Chairman. Well, first of all, let me thank each of you \nfor being here. I apologize for the kind of treatment you \nreceived as dedicated public servants. It should not have been.\n    And I would now like to introduce the three targets of the \nIRS investigation: former Senator Majority Leader Howard Baker, \nformer Congressman James Quillen, and the District Attorney \nGeneral for the First District of Tennessee, Mr. David \nCrockett.\n    I welcome you gentlemen. Please be seated. I would like to \nstart out by publicly apologizing as to what happened to you. \nIt should happen to no American. It should happen to no public \nfigure. And I am outraged that it did.\n    I do want to point out that this did not happen during this \nadministration.\n    It was back in the 1980's. We are concerned about an agency \nthat is too often out of control. And I just want each of you \nto know we do feel outraged by your treatment. And we \nappreciate the fact that you are here today.\n    With that, I would like to call on you, Senator Baker, for \nany comments you may care to make."

"","","kerrey","Senator Kerrey","    Senator Baker. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I \nthank you very much for the opportunity to be here. I commend \nyou for having these hearings. My name is Howard H. Baker, Jr. \nI have had the honor of serving in the United States for 18 \nyears beginning of January 1967 until January of 1985. And \nduring that time, I had the privilege of serving as minority \nleader for two terms. And then, the last 4 years, my final \nterm, I served as majority leader.\n    On leaving the Senate in 1985, I returned to my profession \nas a lawyer and have practiced law since then, except for a 16-\nmonth period in 1987 and 1988 when President Reagan asked me to \nserve as his chief of staff.\n    Mr. Chairman, a few weeks ago, I was visited in my law \noffice here in Washington by a member of this committee's staff \nand was told that as a result of the committee's inquiry into \nIRS activity, it had learned that I was at one time the target \nof an investigation by an agent of the IRS criminal division, \nan investigation that based on totally fabricated facts.\n    I knew nothing of that investigation either before, during, \nor after the time it was terminated. I knew nothing of it until \nI was informed by this committee's staff. I must repeat, Mr. \nChairman, that the allegations were absolutely and totally \nwithout foundation and did not occur.\n    The Chairman. Inexcusable.\n    Senator Baker. Mr. Chairman, I find it very disturbing \nindeed that the criminal division agent attempted to frame me \nand reported his bogus allegations to the FBI and to the \nJustice Department.\n    I may say that I am grateful in the extreme that others in \nthe service, particularly including these three IRS employees \nwho are here today were able to terminate this malicious plan.\n    And I regret, however, that apparently the three IRS \nemployees who challenged another employee's fabricated criminal \ninvestigation themselves suffered retaliation. They should not \nhave been retaliated against. They should have been commended.\n    I would like to express my profound appreciation to Special \nAgent Henderson, Ms. Gernt, Ms. Latham for standing up for \njustice and for my rights as a taxpayer and citizen really at \nthe expense of their own career and for them to know that I am \ngrateful.\n    Had this matter proceeded, I am confident that I would have \nbeen in a position to employ the best lawyers and accountants \nand to demonstrate the fallacy of these allegations. But Mr. \nChairman, I am deeply troubled that others who are perhaps less \nfortunate but who might find themselves in a similar situation \nwith such charges leveled against them might not have the \nresources. They might not be in a position to defend \nthemselves.\n    And it is for that reason more than any that I commend this \ncommittee for inquiring into these matters, for ventilating \nthese facts and to protect those American citizens who might in \nthe future be subjected to such indignity and humiliation.\n    Mr. Chairman, may I add that I am not nor have I ever been \none who sets out to savage government. I have enormous respect \nfor public servants, members of the House and Senate, the \nbureaucracy, the executive department. It is the very essence \nof our Nationhood.\n    And I commend you, but I also commend in advance Secretary \nRubin because I am confident that he will do what needs to be \ndone or the new director of Internal Revenue. I have high \nconfidence that he will undertake the measures that are \nnecessary to rectify such a situation.\n    And I also express my admiration for other members of the \nIRS. They are by and large like other Federal employees and \nservants, dedicated, loyal, and honest people.\n    But I must tell you, Mr. Chairman, I have never been so \ninfuriated about an event such as this.\n    The Chairman. With good reason.\n    Senator Baker. Some may say, well, nothing happened. You \ndid not know about it. So why are you concerned about it? This \nmatter was referred to the Justice Department. There is an FBI \nfile. That is a record in this government, notwithstanding that \nit is totally false. I have seen too many raw files of the FBI \nto think that those allegations are now totally obliterated, \nnotwithstanding that I sit here and tell you there is not a \nscintilla of truth. There are still in somebody's file some \nplace.\n    So that is the real danger, not that I could not defend \nmyself, I think I could have. Not that I was not damaged \nfinally because nothing happened. Regrettably because of the \nsystem in a pernicious, evil way victimized me in a way that \ncannot be totally eliminated.\n    I commend you, Mr. Chairman, for having these hearings. I \ncommend the members of the committee on both sides of the aisle \nfor their patience in going into this matter at this time.\n    The Chairman. Well, let me say again, Senator Baker, you \nhave brought great honor by your service to the term ``public \nservant''. And to me, it is unbelievable that a man of your \ndistinguished background could be the victim of this kind of \nfalse investigation. And if they would dare do it to you, what \nabout the average American citizen who might be targeted? What \nchance do they have to protect themselves? This is not \nsomething that should ever happen in the United States of \nAmerica. And I apologize.\n    The Chairman. Congressman Quillen, we welcome you as one of \nthose most distinguished members of Congress. It is good to see \nyou here, but I apologize for the circumstances.\n    Senator Chafee. Mr. Chairman, unfortunately due to a \nlongtime commitment, I cannot stay throughout all of this. But \nI just wanted to join in your commendation of Senator Baker and \nto say when you have a person of the towering integrity of \nSenator Baker being attacked in one of these schemes, it just \nshows you the peril that an ordinary citizen would be subjected \nto because they do not have the known reputation of Senator \nBaker. And thus, that citizen could suffer terribly.\n    And I share in the indignation that Senator Baker voiced in \nwhat took place. I am sure Congressman Quillen will reiterate \nthat indignation. But this has been very powerful testimony. \nAnd I want to thank everybody."

I did not have the honor of serving with \nyou in the U.S. Senate, but I can tell you your reputation is \nwell known. And it is truly an outrage that anybody set out to \nframe you and to diminish your reputation based on totally \nfalse accusations. That is absolutely outrageous.\n    We have heard during these hearings a number of outrages. \nAnd I think the most important thing we can say to you and \nothers who are similarly victimized we are going to bend our \nbest efforts to stop it so that it is not permitted to ever \nhappen again to anyone.\n    Senator Roth said so well, if it could happen to a Howard \nBaker, it could happen even more easily to an average American \ncitizen, and as you said in your statement, Senator Baker.\n    But I do want to say on behalf of Senate Democrats if I \ncould be permitted to speak on their behalf, Senator Roth, I \nthink it is appropriate that your honesty and your integrity \nare without question. And we appreciate deeply that you have \ncome here today to express your outrage.\n    I think it will help that we move the legislation necessary \nto correct this agency, but it is going to take more than \nlegislation. It is going to take a change of attitude. And we \nhope that that helps in that regard as well.\n    Senator Baker. Senator, I thank you very much.\n    The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator Conrad. I \nappreciate those words. And as I noted, this is something that \noccurred back in the 1980's.\n    I would now return to you, Congressman Quillen. I would \nappreciate any comments you may care to make."

"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Congressman Quillen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate \nthe opportunity of being here with such a distinguished group. \nYou do a great job as do the members of your committee.\n    I am James H. Quillen of Kingsfort, Tennessee. And I \nretired from the U.S. Congress as a member of the House of \nRepresentatives after 34 years of continuous service. I am one \nof the three targets referred to in this testimony you have \njust heard.\n    Earlier on in my Congressional career, a prominent \nbusinessman had been sued by the IRS. And he won the case. \nHowever, he had to pay the legal fees even though he won.\n    When this was brought to my attention, I introduced a bill \nwhich stated specifically in the event the IRS lost a case \nagainst a taxpayer, the government had to pay the legal fees of \nthat taxpayer. Following this, the IRS sent a team in to audit \nmy personal tax returns.\n    Later on in my Congressional career for reasons unbeknownst \nto me, I was targeted by a special agent of the Criminal \nInvestigation Division of the IRS. He would often visit several \nlocal bars and after a few drinks would loudly state my name \nsaying, ``We're going to get that crook Congressman Quillen.'' \nThis happened not just one time, but many times.\n    As a result of those verbal assaults, the IRS group \nmanager, special agent Tom Henderson felt it was necessary to \nput the special agent's alleged charges to rest. As a result \nspecial agent Henderson conducted a preliminary investigation \nto determine there was absolutely no basis of the fact in the \nspecial agent's claim.\n    That, however, did not stop him. Not only did he not lose \nhis job, but continued to boast that he was still going to \nbring me down.\n    I so greatly appreciate the efforts of special agent Tom \nHenderson on my behalf as well as those of former IRS employees \nPatty Gernt and Barbara Latham for having the courage to stand \nup against what they knew was wrong despite the considerable \ncost to their own careers and future livelihood.\n    Special agent Henderson, Ms. Gernt, and Ms. Latham, I would \nlike to express my utmost respect for you and for the values \nyou uphold.\n    Mr. Chairman, I know there are other agents who have the \ncharacter and integrity of those three fine people. I hope and \ntrust that with the Senate Finance Committee's continuing \noversight of the IRS that these employees will prevail.\n    Mr. Chairman, experiencing that dramatic charge against me \nas a former businessman before I came to the Congress and \nbefore I served 8 years in the State legislature was very, very \nshocking indeed.\n    I cannot believe that a branch of this government which we \nall respect would stoop so low to have an employee like the one \nin Johnson City who criticized me and tried to bring me down.\n    It was a feeling inside. And it has not gone away. It \nprobably never will. But the courage of those IRS individuals \nwho stood by me is a shining example of what could happen.\n    I often hear from former constituents and friends, why not \nabolish the IRS and go to a flat tax? I think the IRS needs \nsomething done, if not abolish it altogether, abolish what has \nbeen happening in the past to individuals like Senator Baker \nand those of whom you have heard today. Thank you for the \nopportunity of being here.\n    The Chairman. Well, again, let me thank you for being here \nand apologizing for the ordeal you were forced to endure. I had \nthe honor and pleasure of serving with you. And you, too, bring \ngreat honor to the term ``public servant''.\n    I would just like to echo what you said to these three \nindividuals. They characterize the best in public service. And \nI am a believer that the vast majority of employees in the IRS \nare dedicated, well meaning, hard working citizens. And we are \nall here because we want to make sure that these kinds of \npractices do not happen in the future.\n    So thank you for taking the time to join us.\n    Congressman Quillen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman\n    The Chairman. And now, it is my privilege to call upon \nDavid Crockett who is, I believe, District Attorney General for \nthe First Judicial District."

"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Mr. Crockett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is good to be \nhere. We appreciate your interest in our problems. I am David \nCrockett, named incidentally after a distant relative of mine \nwho once served in Congress from Tennessee.\n    The Chairman. We are impressed. [Laughter.]\n    Mr. Crockett. Well, the voters at home seem to like it."
break,break,break,break
"","","","","[Laughter.]\n     I have served as District Attorney General of the First \nJudicial District in the State of Tennessee for the past 16 \nyears. I am presently engaged in a campaign seeking my third \nconsecutive term in that office. Prior to that time, I served \nfor 10 years as an assistant district attorney. I am a graduate \nof East Tennessee State University, the University of Tennessee \nCollege of Law. I served 4 years during the Vietnam conflict as \na captain in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the United \nStates Army, concluding my service as the Chief of Military \nJustice at Ft. Jackson, South Carolina.\n    I, like Congressman Quillen and Senator Baker, was a target \nof an IRS agent who was assigned in East Tennessee in the mid-\n1980's. I first became aware of this particular agent when his \nautomobile hit another car as he came out of a bar onto North \nRoan Street in Johnson City. The agent was charged with DUI.\n    He refused a breathalyzer test and with the testimony of \nother Federal employees and some other agents who swore that he \nwas not under the influence when this hit this lady head on was \nsuccessful in defending his DUI case. But a member of my staff \nat my direction had prosecuted him in this case.\n    And this agent apparently at that time included me in a \nplan that he had formulated apparently for revenge directed at \nme and perhaps career advancement as to Congressman Quillen and \nSenator Baker.\n    Shortly after his acquittal, he became proclaiming publicly \nin local bars and restaurants that we were tax cheats. That is \nCongressman Quillen, Senator Baker, and I were all tax cheats \nand were somehow defrauding the Federal Government and that he \nwould see that he got us.\n    Frankly, being the least in that crowd certainly \npolitically and powerwise, I was somewhat flattered to be \nincluded with those allies. [Laughter.]\n     I thought that if worse came to worse, I had some pretty \nstout support. See, after this agent made these repeated \nallegations and this was done frequently when he was drinking, \nit eventually led to an investigation of me that dragged on for \nseveral years, first by the IRS and then later by some of his \nfriends with other Federal agencies.\n    No charges were ever placed against me. No action was ever \ntaken for any alleged wrongdoing. In fact, the investigation \njust simply died without anyone ever formally advising me that \nit did in fact occur.\n    I knew it had occurred because this agent would frequently \ngo to local sheriff's offices or other places and proclaim that \nI was about to be indicted as the district attorney in the \nFirst District by Federal grand juries and I was under \ninvestigation and it was only a matter of time before I was \nremoved from office.\n    And even though nothing was done, the damage even today \nremains. It still lingers, particularly around election time. I \nwould make the observation, Senator, that reputations are \ndelicate things and once lost or tarnished are very difficult \nto ever totally regain.\n    I know now that these courageous agents who have been here \ntoday and testified did in fact intervene or attempt to \nintervene. And some sacrificed their careers to stop this \nparticular rogue agent.\n    To them, I want to today formally say thank you and express \nmy deepest appreciation to them for what they did for us.\n    As for this IRS agent, this particular agent, his drinking \nseemed to get worse. Yet, he continued on his job until one \nnight in Knoxville, Tennessee early in the 1990's, he and a \nrelative were caught with a quantity of cocaine in their \nvehicle.\n    The agent tried to bluff his way out of trouble by telling \nthe local deputy who had stopped him that his relative who was \na nephew, as I recall, were engaged in some kind of an \nundercover operation for the IRS. And that was the reason they \npossessed the cocaine. The local deputy persisted and contacted \nthe agent's superior who knew nothing of such an operation that \nhe was maintaining.\n    And so after that episode, the agent's friends in the IRS \nand his supporters there could no longer protect him. And he \nwas subsequently fired from his position. Somehow, he did avoid \nprosecution for the cocaine possession charge in Knoxville \nwhich incidentally is not within my judicial district or I \nthink the result would have been different. [Laughter.]\n     In any event, I can say this, this agent's ambition to get \nsome big people to advance his own career was wrong and the \nfailure of those in management to keep him in check was \ndisgraceful, particularly when that management turned their \nanimosity upon the few agents of integrity who tried to bring \nthat particular agent to their attention. These agents of honor \nare in my opinion the true heroes of this story.\n    If anything can be learned from this episode it is that we \naverage Americans who work every and pay our taxes still fear \nthe IRS agents who can by virtue of their positions destroy \nlives and ruin careers. If our story can help prevent others \nfrom being targeted unjustly and help ensure better supervision \nof IRS field agents, then our time here today will be well \nspent.\n    I sincerely hope this committee will set aside partisan \ndifferences and partisan politics in an effort to craft \nlegislation to bring in check the abuses of power that so many \nof us have endured. Thank you for having me here.\n    The Chairman. Thank you very much for being here today, Mr. \nCrockett.\n    Let me make just one additional comment that, as shocking \nand unbelievable as this whole incident is, I also find it \nunbelievable that the agent involved and responsible for this \nwas in no way punished by the IRS for his misdeeds. Rather than \nhe suffer, those who tried to do what was right were the \nvictims. And that was wrong.\n    Now, we will go to the questions we have of the three \nwitnesses. Let me be very clear about the three IRS employees \nwho have testified here today. Is it your testimony that a \nspecial agent of the IRS framed these three gentlemen seated \nnext to you in a completely false criminal case?\n    Mr. Henderson. Yes, sir.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Henderson.\n    Mr. Henderson. He attempted to do it.\n    Ms. Gernt. Yes, sir, that is correct.\n    Ms. Latham. Yes.\n    The Chairman. And is it also true that the three of you \nexperienced severe retaliation for your efforts in breaking up \nthat false criminal case?\n    Mr. Henderson. Yes, sir.\n    The Chairman. Ms. Gernt.\n    Ms. Gernt. Yes, sir.\n    Ms. Latham. Yes.\n    The Chairman. Do any of you have any fear of retaliation \nfor your testimony today before this committee?\n    Mr. Henderson.\n    Mr. Henderson. Absolutely.\n    The Chairman. Ms. Gernt.\n    Ms. Gernt. Certainly.\n    The Chairman. Ms. Latham.\n    Ms. Latham. Yes.\n    The Chairman. Ms. Gernt, you stated that you came here to \nWashington to inform the IRS leadership about this case and \nothers. Do you feel you received retaliation for that effort?\n    Ms. Gernt. Yes, sir, I did.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Henderson, I have to assume that the case \nyou described was a work of a single agent who was out of \ncontrol. However, you said in your statement that you had seen \nsomething like this case earlier in your career. Please \nexplain.\n    Mr. Henderson. Yes, sir. When I was a brand new special \nagent, I ran across what appeared to be a bribe from a \ndefendant to another special agent who was working a prominent \npolitical figure at that time.\n    I turned that information over as we were required to do \nit. And again, I was placed under investigation and lived under \nan investigation for almost a year until they finally decided \nthey had better cover the whole thing up. And I was allowed to \ntransfer out and to another POD. And the whole affair was \nquietly swept under the rug.\n    The Chairman. Have you ever been aware of CID agents who \nhave created other false cases against either taxpayers or \nemployees? Would you say this has happened with some frequency?\n    Mr. Henderson. Yes, sir, it has happened with frequency.\n    Ms. Gernt. Yes, sir.\n    Ms. Latham. Yes, sir.\n    The Chairman. Have you ever been made aware of agents \nconducting illegal wiretaps or surveillances against either \ntaxpayers or employees, Mr. Henderson?\n    Mr. Henderson. Yes, sir, in Knoxville, Tennessee, the chief \nof CID used the agents in our group to pull surveillance on \neach other. They pulled surveillance on Patty. They pulled \nsurveillance on Barbara. They pulled surveillance on me. They \nused their badges and credentials and government cars all \nillegally. And it is well documented.\n    The Chairman. Have you ever been aware of the destruction \nof evidence that may have benefitted a defendant, Mr. \nHenderson?\n    Mr. Henderson. Yes, sir, in the same case, the handwriting \nexemplars that inspection took from Barbara and Patty were \ndestroyed. This was evidence that they destroyed. That is what \nthey are talking about, about not leaving a paper trail so that \nthey could not prove using the same evidence what happened. \nYes, so they did destroy evidence. That is unprecedented. You \ndo not destroy evidence in a criminal case of any kind like \nthat.\n    The Chairman. Ms. Gernt.\n    Ms. Gernt. That is correct, sir. They did destroy the \nquestionnaires. And contrary to the Internal Revenue Code, when \nI left my position in 1994, I was allowed to take personal \nitems from my office. And in a very short time, special agents \nwere sent to Johnson City from the Knoxville, Tennessee office.\n    And my cases, including tax cases which should normally be \nkept for a period of 7 years were shredded by two special \nagents over a matter of days with continually running the \nshredder to shred any information that I had collected, any \nnotations, and therefore potentially destroying evidence \npossibly of an exculpatory nature.\n    The Chairman. Ms. Latham.\n    Ms. Latham. Yes, sir, this evidence was destroyed by the \nIRS Inspection Division. And they did this to cover up any \nevidence of harassment and retaliation against us.\n    The Chairman. This will be my last question on this round. \nAre you aware of any instances where the IRS has lied in court, \nMr. Henderson?\n    Mr. Henderson. No, sir.\n    The Chairman. Ms. Gernt.\n    Ms. Gernt. Yes, sir, I am.\n    The Chairman. Ms. Latham.\n    Ms. Latham. Yes, sir, I am.\n    The Chairman. Senator Grassley.\n    Senator Grassley. I do not think I am going to make any \nstatements. I think that I need to applaud these three very \nbrave IRS employees who are willing to do what is right. And \nobviously, I cannot say it better than Senator Conrad or \nSenator Roth did, the very strong statements of apologies to \nour colleagues and to Mr. Crockett for what has happened to \nthem.\n    And I would follow up on what Senator Baker said to the \nthree of you, his commendation to you for being brave and for \nhelping him personally, but also for standing up for what is \nright which is even more important, and the problems that you \nface as a result of this, the problems you have faced as a \nresult of this.\n    And Senator Baker's commendation reminds me to repeat \nthings that I have said in the past about whistle blowers that \nnobody has ever followed my advice. And maybe, it is not as \ngood advice as I think it is.\n    But I work hard in the false claims bill, for instance, to \nprotect whistle blowers. There was a whistle blower protection \nact. It was the first bill that President Bush signed in his \nnew presidency to protect whistle blower. And I know you do not \nhave a lot of confidence in this legislation, but it still is a \nbetter climate than it was before there was some protection for \nwhistle blowers.\n    But I do not think any amount of respect we show in our \nstatement for whistle blowers or any laws we pass to protect \nyou is going to do the good when a President of the United \nStates be he a Republican or Democrat, and I have said this in \npresidencies of both parties, until we have a rose garden \nceremony honoring whistle blowers from time to time.\n    As Senator Baker said, you are truly patriotic. And that \ndoes not apply just to you. That applies to other people who \nhave done more and less than you have done because you are \nconsidered within the bureaucracy as an outlaw, as a skunk, at \na picnic would be respected.\n    And when are we going to admit that whistle blowers are \ngoing to help us do our job of oversight, to make sure that the \ntaxpayer's money is used wisely, to see that the rule of law is \nrespected?\n    We in Congress and prosecutors around the country cannot do \nthe job without the help of people like you who know where the \nskeletons are buried and what closets they are in and to help \nus find them. And I hope some day, some president will honor \npeople like you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Grassley.\n    Senator Nickles.\n    Senator Nickles. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I want \nto thank all of our panelists, especially the IRS agents.\n    And Mr. Henderson, you are still employed by the IRS?\n    Mr. Henderson. That is correct.\n    Senator Nickles. Ms. Gernt, are you still employed?\n    Ms. Gernt. Retired.\n    Senator Nickles. Retired. And Ms. Latham.\n    Ms. Latham. Retired.\n    Senator Nickles. Retired, both of you are retired. I have \nbeen reading your statements. And I apologize. I was not here \nwhen you presented them. I had to step out. I very much \nappreciate our friend and colleague, Senator Baker and \nCongressman Quillen for their statements and also for the \nAssistant Attorney General.\n    I am bothered by this kind of abuse. And I am bothered I \nguess in reading the statement. We had one really bad agent, \nbut you all complained. And so I am bothered that justice was \nnot brought about to this person until I guess he was found \nwith cocaine in the car.\n    Mr. Henderson. That is right.\n    Senator Nickles. But what really bothers me is why didn't \nhis supervisor do something? What has happened to the \nsupervisor when those complaints were made, and this was in one \nor two of your statements that you had alluded to.\n    So when these allegations were made against this one person \nthat obviously had a gambling, a drinking problem, maybe a \nsexual harassment problem and so on, when complaints were made, \nwhy didn't they do sometimes? What has happened to the \nsupervisor in this process?\n    Mr. Henderson. I was his immediate supervisor. And I tried \nto stop him when I found out what was going on. And I went to \nmy chief and assistant chief and wanted to take his \ncredentials, his gun, and actually get him professional help. \nBut at that time, I did not know the extent of what he was \ndoing. And I was told to sit down and shut up, that I was under \ninvestigation.\n    And I subsequently was put in a position where I had to \nresign as group manager or face possible criminal and legal \nproblems of my own because it was obvious that the people above \nme, no matter what I said would lie, just flat out lie. And I \nwould sitting betwixt and between a rogue agent and a \nmanagement that would not cough up the truth.\n    And you have to understand that when I got to east \nTennessee as group manager, this agent had been there a long \ntime. Everybody knew what he was doing. I was just the only \nmanager that tried to stop it. And that is what got me into \ntrouble.\n    Senator Nickles. Well, let me ask you a question. So you \ntook this to your supervisor?\n    Mr. Henderson. That is correct.\n    Senator Nickles. And they, he or she refused to do anything \nabout it?\n    Mr. Henderson. I took it to my supervisor. The agent went \naround me. And they got together. And I assume and I can only \nassume this because of all the things that I had heard that had \nhappened in that district prior to me becoming a manager, there \nwere a lot of skeletons in the closet that they just could not \nallow to come out.\n    And of course, when I tried to stop this agent, I assumed \nhe threatened them with those skeletons.\n    Senator Nickles. Well, let me ask you. I am interested. \nYour immediate supervisors, are they still employed by the IRS?\n    Mr. Henderson. One of them is. I might add, he has a \nmanagement position with no real position in the Nashville \nDistrict today.\n    Senator Nickles. And what is his name? You can write it out \nto me. You can give it to me in a minute. I am meeting with the \nCommissioner shortly. And I am concerned about a bad apple, but \nI am concerned about the fact that once it was brought to the \nattention of the higher ups that they were not willing to take \naction.\n    Mr. Henderson. Let me add something here. During this \nprocess, after I had left Tennessee--and I got out of Tennessee \nbecause I knew what was coming. I had a little more experience \nand I guess a little more savvy as to what will happen. And \nBarbara and Patty did not. And they did not make it out.\n    But Patty called me and was just horrified that the group \nmanager who was in the process of railroading her and Barbara \nout of their jobs at the time was using a government vehicle on \ngovernment time going to the Holiday Inn with his secretary on \na regular basis. And inspection would not investigate it.\n    So she was just horrified, what can I do? Here is this guy \nrunning me out of my job and my career. And every day, he is \npicking up his secretary in a government car, every other day \nor so, and they are going to the Holiday Inn for two or three \nhours.\n    So I told her hire a private investigator. I think it took \na second day. They have--we have a videotape of it.\n    Senator Nickles. He is still an employee?\n    Mr. Henderson. Oh, yes. They created a grade 14 position \nfor him in Atlanta. That is where he is at today.\n    Senator Nickles. If you would give me that name and \ninformation, I would appreciate it.\n    Mr. Henderson. Glad to.\n    Senator Nickles. Let me ask on kind of a related subject, \nMs. Gernt, you are no longer employed. Did you have to retire \nor you retired as a result of this?\n    Ms. Gernt. I retired as a result of it.\n    Senator Nickles. When did you retire?\n    Ms. Gernt. 1994.\n    Senator Nickles. And Ms. Latham, when did you retire?\n    Ms. Latham. I retired in 1996 after reaching an out-of-\ncourt settlement of a lawsuit that I filed in 1994 and opted \nfor early retirement.\n    Senator Nickles. Related to these events?\n    Ms. Latham. Oh, yes, because of those events, I spent 3 \nyears there that destroyed my mental and physical health.\n    Senator Nickles. And Ms. Gernt, when you retired, you \nmentioned it was a result of the conflicts I guess you were \nhaving with superiors?\n    Ms. Gernt. That is correct.\n    Senator Nickles. In reading your statement, including \nsexual harassment as well.\n    Ms. Gernt. It runs rampant. This was--these were a series \nof events that occurred frequently. They are not or were not \nisolated incidents. In 1993, as I said, when I--and I believe \nthe constitution says I have a right to an attorney in a \ncriminal situation. But when I attempted to bring my attorney \nto the CID office to lay things out, let us find out what is \ngoing on and why, we were not allowed to enter the Criminal \nInvestigation Division.\n    And this manager at the time physically struck my attorney. \nAnd I become so upset and ill that I attempted to leave the \nCriminal Investigation Division. And the group manager struck \nme in an attempt to hold me back, thus separating me from my \nattorney. That is the incident that Ms. Latham referred to.\n    The government attorney's were not good enough for this \nmanager. And in an attempt to cover up numerous lies, numerous \nlies that we now have in my possession and the possession of my \nattorney through the discovery process in my litigation \nregarding these matters, the government hired two, not one, but \ntwo private attorneys for its own manager.\n    The events that followed were that we were able to work out \na settlement agreement in which I was instructed not to \ndisclose the terms of the settlement and to never relate to \nanyone the reasons for the lawsuit, but according to what I \nknow Mr. Rossotti has waived that, the nondisclosure clause. \nAnd I am able because of him and his help to discuss this \ntoday. Otherwise, I would not be permitted to discuss anything.\n    Senator Nickles. The settlement, did you agree not to sue \nthe IRS or those agents in the future, either of you as part of \nyour settlement?\n    Ms. Latham. We both had to agree to that.\n    Senator Nickles. We learned of that yesterday. Let me just \ntouch on one other thing, Ms. Gernt, that you mentioned in your \nstatement. You mentioned that in several cases, the Criminal \nInvestigation Division would open a case not only on an \nindividual, but maybe several family members?\n    Ms. Gernt. Yes.\n    The Chairman. And then, use that as leverage? Let me ask \nyou, when you were trying to draw these cases to a close, if \nthe person that CID had the complaint against would settle, \nthen CID might be willing to drop the cases on other family \nmembers? Did that occur frequently?\n    Ms. Gernt. That occurs frequently.\n    Senator Nickles. You think that is an abuse or intimidation \nin the process?\n    Ms. Gernt. It is all of those.\n    Senator Nickles. I concur. But it is a frequent occurring \nevent?\n    Ms. Gernt. Yes, we have had one agent who had numbered so \nmany cases, related cases, aunts, uncles, brother, sister, \nfriends, neighbor that the computer would not take the number \nof cases this special agent numbered because they were \nliterally pages. The entire Southeast Region in the Criminal \nInvestigation Division could never have worked those.\n    Senator Nickles. Wow! Well, Mr. Chairman, I compliment you \nfor these hearings. And I am amazed. This is the third day of \nthis second round of hearings that we have had. And each day, \nsome of these stories about IRS abuse of power and again by a \nfew people, not all agents, but a few people and particularly \nin the Criminal Investigation Division are shocking, absolutely \nshocking. When you have to hire investigators and/or \nprosecutors to be investigating the criminal investigators, we \nhave a real problem. And I think we do have a problem.\n    And I compliment these three agents for their courage. And \nan apology is necessary. It is a shame that these things happen \nto government servants. And to think that they also have \ntargets who happen to be popular, political figures just makes \nit worse. That should not happen to anybody period.\n    And I am shocked to think that one or two of the people \nthat might have been in the chain of the command that was aware \nof this did not take action, but he is still on the government \npayroll. That is not acceptable. Hopefully, it will be remedied \nvery, very shortly.\n    So I appreciate the statements that our panelists have \nmade. I think these hearings have been very enlightening on \ncases where some people clearly have abused their power.\n    And they should be prosecuted. Some people, termination is \nnot satisfactory punishment for this type of abuse of power \nthat can destroy lives, destroy careers, spent untold millions \nof dollars, not only that, but the anxiety level for the \nduration of some of these cases and so on is just an \nunbelievable hardship.\n    So I thank all of our panelists. And Mr. Chairman, thank \nyou for having these hearings. It has been very enlightening.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Nickles.\n    I want to thank Commissioner Rossotti for lifting the gag \nrule so that people like Ms. Gernt could testify today.\n    Again, I want to thank each and everyone of you for being \nhere today. You have given another example by your testimony of \npublic service. And I applaud you for what you have done. Thank \nyou very much.\n    The committee is in recess."

break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    The Chairman. The committee will please be in order. First, \nlet me begin by welcoming IRS Commissioner, Charles Rossotti. \nWe very much appreciate your appearance today, as well as the \nleadership and tremendous effort of reform that you have \nalready initiated within the Internal Revenue Service.\n     I want you to know that I am pleased with the seven-step \nplan announced this week for the agency, including your support \nfor the creation of a new Inspector General for Tax \nAdministration. As I have commented before, I wholeheartedly \napprove of the appointment of William Webster, whose task it is \nto report back on the proper role of the criminal investigative \ndivision.\n     The purpose of the hearings in September and this week is \nto uncover problems in the IRS that require either legislative \nor management changes.\n     And consequently, last Friday, when Commissioner Rossotti \nand I met, we agreed that because IRS reform would best be \nserved by focusing on solutions and not adjudication of \nspecific problems we have heard during the course of our \noversight, I suggested that these matters be referred to the \nGeneral Accounting Office, in the short-term, and thereafter be \nassigned for further investigation by the new Inspector General \nfor Tax Administration, which is contained in the legislation \nthe Senate is expected to act on next week.\n     Today, we will focus on solutions, solutions to the \nserious concerns our oversight has raised, rather than address \nspecific cases. I believe this is the best use of our time and \nwill be most productive to the accomplishment of our \nobjectives.\n     There is a second purpose to these oversight hearings, and \nthat is to strengthen the hand of the Commissioner in dealing \nwith the IRS bureaucracy, a bureaucracy that in my judgment has \nbeen too long outside the control of any commissioner.\n     Oversight is a painful process. It means focusing on \nthings that go wrong. It means seeing things you would not wish \nto see and hearing things you would prefer not to hear. But \nonce that process is underway, real change becomes possible.\n     I think that all of us have a better understanding of the \nproblems with the IRS than we did only nine months ago.\n     Commissioner Rossotti, you have one of the toughest jobs \nin Washington. This committee wants you to be successful, and \nwe welcome you here today.\n    Senator Moynihan."

"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Yes. Well, to paraphrase another member \nof the administration, Commissioner, how was your week?\n     We have had a traumatic time here and do not really know \nhow general a problem we are dealing with or how much there are \nisolated events that are horrors, but are, in some sense, \nisolated and not systemic. It is the kind of thing you are good \nat, and we like to hear you about.\n     I would like to make one request, sir, which is that we \nhave had these specific named public civil servants come before \nus and speak of troubles they have had and their concern for \nretaliation.\n     I think it would be helpful, Mr. Chairman, if we could \nget--in due time--a case by case report from the IRS about this \nperson and those charges. Could we do that, sir?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Yes, sir."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    And one thing that--I am sorry, Mr. \nChairman. I am going to have to raise it again. A month ago, \nMarch 31--today is May Day, my golly, and all over Europe there \nare no parades.\n     You wrote us--you personally wrote, as we understand--a \nlong six-page letter. A seven-page letter on the problems of \nimplementing the legislation that we have reported out in a \ntime frame that diverts you from the year 2000 problem with the \nagency's work generally, and you gave us specific dates that \nyou could get this provision in and get that provision in.\n     In the interval, we have created a select committee here \nin the Senate on this issue. Two years late perhaps, but even \nso, with our very distinguished colleague, Senator Bennett, as \nchairman, and he has been going around. He had breakfast \nyesterday with the Secretary of Defense, who thinks things are \nbetter than the GAO had reported last year.\n     I do not think the Chairman would mind, Senator Bennett, \nby my saying that the GAO had reported last year things were a \ndisaster. So, if they are better than a disaster, well, so much \nfor weapons systems.\n     If you could speak to that subject, because we have to \nhave a government-wide program. We have not had yet. We have, \nin you, someone who understands the subject and will get on top \nof things.\n     So, we welcome you, sir, and look forward to your \ncomments.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Thank you.\n     The Chairman. Again, Commissioner Rossotti, it is a \npleasure to welcome you, and please proceed with your \nstatement."

"","","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","     Commissioner Rossotti. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank \nyou for your kind comments about me, and also, for the \nopportunity to appear here. I also want to thank you and \nSenator Moynihan and the whole committee for your leadership in \ninsuring that our taxpayers are treated fairly.\n    Mr. Chairman, at my confirmation hearing last fall, I \npledged to bring about fundamental change at the IRS and to \nimprove, in the broadest sense, the way the agency serves the \npublic, and I just want to reaffirm that commitment today.\n     I think the hearings of this past week further demonstrate \nthat fundamental change at the IRS is needed. I also think that \nevery American who heard the testimony would be disturbed, as I \nwas, at that testimony, and we simply must change the \nconditions that lead to the situations described by your \nwitnesses.\n     We have to help provide better service to taxpayers who \nwillingly comply with our obligations, and we have to have \nabsolute respect for the rights of all taxpayers. We must \ninsist on fairness and accountability throughout the agency, \nand to do this, we have to have a quality work place which \nprovides every employee a positive environment that is needed \nfor them to be able to be productive and to provide quality \nservice to taxpayers.\n    Mr. Chairman, as you and others on the committee have \nnoted, the overwhelming majority of IRS employees are honest \nand hardworking and dedicated people, and I believe that they \nare just as upset about allegations of misconduct and \nmistreatment of taxpayers as we are.\n     Now, as you noted, Mr. Chairman, I am prevented from \nspeaking about the individual cases discussed this week, and we \nagreed that would not be the most productive way for me to \nspend my time. But I do want to tell the committee today that \nthe abuse of even one taxpayer or one employee is one too many \nfor me."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Commissioner, could you just, in the \ninterest of the many people watching, tell why you are \nprevented?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Yes.\n     Discussing any information matter of a taxpayer, even so \nmuch as acknowledging that a taxpayer has filed a return or \nthat we had any interaction with a taxpayer is completely \nprohibited by law, and all of us are bound by those laws, \nunless we were to get a waiver. Not only from the individual \ntaxpayer, but in most cases there is more than one person \ninvolved."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    And this is meant to protect the \nindividual taxpayer.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Yes. And equally, there are other \nlaws. For example, there are grand jury rules that, on the \ncriminal matters, also prevent any disclosure. And also, even \nwith respect to employees. There are privacy laws.\n     So, without a great deal of prior consultation and legal \nactivity, it really is not possible to comment on an individual \ncase. I should also mention that for good reasons, we did not \neven know what these cases were going to be until we heard them \nat the same time.\n     So we have not had an opportunity to research each \nindividual case. Quite apart from the legal restrictions.\n     But I do want to stress, even though I am not commenting \non the individual cases--and I have said this in a couple of \nstatements this week--from my point of view, any kind of \nmistreatment, of one taxpayer or one employee, is one too many.\n     And I very much welcome your suggestion, Mr. Chairman, \nthat the GAO be given the responsibility to investigate and get \nthe facts on each and every one of these investigations. And I \npromise you that when we get the results of those \ninvestigations, we will act accordingly and take disciplinary \nactions where the allegations are substantiated.\n     Now, looking to the future, the modernization that I have \nproposed will require a dramatic break from past practice in \nalmost every facet of the agency. From the internal structure, \nthe technology, management roles and responsibilities and \nrecruiting of senior executives.\n     However, a change of this magnitude will take time, and \nthere is not a magic formula or easy solution that will quickly \nsolve the IRS' problems and transform it into a quality service \norganization. Fundamental change requires a comprehensive, \nsystematic and sustained approach.\n     We will make progress, Mr. Chairman, but it will be step \nby step, over a period of years. And we must set priorities as \nto which problems we first turn our attention to.\n     As Senator Moynihan noted, much as we wish we did not have \nto spend our time on it, we must do whatever is needed to solve \nthe century date change problem, and this massive problem does \nconsume a great deal of management time.\n     And even while we are addressing this problem and \naddressing the changes to the IRS, we must also operate the \nIRS, which even in normal times is a demanding and risky task.\n     Effecting meaningful change at the IRS will also require \nhelp from Congress, and especially the restructuring \nlegislation that the Senate will soon debate. The bill that was \nreported out of your committee, Mr. Chairman, contains \ninitiatives that are the key to our modernization effort, from \nchanging the organizational structure, to establishing an \noversight board and expanding and enhancing taxpayers' rights \nand providing essential personnel flexibilities.\n    Mr. Chairman, as part of my ongoing review and systematic \nstudy of all parts of the IRS, one of the techniques that I am \nrelying on is to engage the services of some highly respected \nindividuals to assist in my efforts.\n     In February of this year, former Controller General, \nCharles Bowsher, accepted my offer to head up an independent \nreview of the inspection service to advise me how it can best \nperform its essential mission. Mr. Bowsher and his team of \ninvestigators, drawn from outside the Treasury Department, are \ncurrently investigating any and all aspects of the inspection \nservice.\n     This includes a review of the organization and methodology \nused to plan and deliver audits and investigations, the \nrelationship between the inspection service and IRS management \nand the relationship between the inspection service and the \nTreasury IG.\n     Now, although the Finance Committee bill will move most of \nthe inspection service to the Treasury Department to form the \nNew Treasury IG for Tax Administration, which is a plan that \nboth Secretary Rubin and I do support, nevertheless, I believe \nthat Mr. Bowsher's recommendations will be useful in the \nfuture.\n     And although his review is not complete, his interim \nreports have already indicated to me that there is a need to \nimprove the process for investigation and action on allegations \nof misconduct by managers, when those allegations fall short of \nthe threshold for treatment as a criminal offense.\n     Therefore, I have taken certain near term steps. As an \ninterim step, I have set up a special panel of officials from \noutside the IRS to act on possible misconduct cases, arising \nfrom the misuse of statistics cases that have been under \ninvestigation since last fall.\n     In addition, I am now about to set up a special task \nforce, overseen by another outside expert, to insure that the \nIRS has sufficient procedures in place to identify, evaluate \nand take consistent action on the results of investigations of \nallegations and of complaints by IRS employees.\n     Now, the second major law enforcement unit of the IRS is \nthe Criminal Investigation Division (CID). It plays a vital \nrole by investigating tax evasion, enforcing our tax laws in \ncases of willful non-compliance and insuring the overall \nfairness of our tax system.\n     The best estimates available indicate that non-compliance \nwith the tax laws, of all kinds, costs about $1,600 per year \nfor every taxpayer return filed. So, given the enormous \nimportance of the CID, I proposed, as the Chairman indicated \nearlier this week, a seven-point action plan to improve CID.\n     First, and probably most basic, I launched an independent \nreview of this division that will be headed by former FBI and \nCIA director, William Webster. And his review will examine all \naspects of CID, including operations, procedures, case \noutcomes, case review practices, discipline and performance \nmeasures.\n     I have also asked Judge Webster and his team to examine \nthe cases involving CID that were brought before this committee \nthis week in order to learn what we can from those cases.\n     Second, as mentioned with regard to the inspection \nservice, I support the creation of the new Inspector General \nfor Tax Administration, which is in your legislation. And like \nall Inspectors General, the new IG for Tax Administration will \nreport directly to Congress and will have the independent \nauthority to investigate all allegations of employee \nmisconduct, including those at CID.\n     Third, we will move quickly to centralize the disciplinary \nprocess for CID managers and employees within the IRS. This \nwill insure appropriate and consistent discipline in CID \nmisconduct cases. A specified group of labor relations experts \nwill review all such cases and recommend action.\n     Fourth, we are creating a new complaint system for \ntaxpayers who have complaints about CID investigations. It will \nbe managed by the new Treasury IG for Tax Administration.\n     Fifth, we will institutionalize the oversight of CID \nwithin the Treasury's Office of Enforcement. To the extent \npermissible by law, the Under Secretary for Enforcement will \ninsure that CID's policies and procedures are fully consistent \nwith those of Treasury's other law enforcement bureaus.\n     Sixth, I am requesting that the Joint Committee on \nTaxation join with the Treasury and the IRS in conducting a \nstudy of willful non-compliance. This review will examine the \nsources and extent of taxpayer non-compliance and measures that \nmight address this problem.\n     Finally, more generally, we must promote a culture of \nopenness, quality and integrity within CID, consistent with my \nvision for the entire agency. I have recently issued a \ndirective to all IRS employees about their obligation to report \nmisconduct, fraud, waste and abuse and to guarantee employees \nfreedom from reprisal when they report any misdeeds.\n    Mr. Chairman, I have made clear, every way I can, that \nthere will be no reprisals for any witness that appeared before \nyou. Or actually, any employee who comes forward to report \nproblems or misconduct.\n    Mr. Chairman, after 28 years of management, I have to say I \nam also very troubled by the reports of discrimination and \nharassment in the IRS work place, and I have heard some of \nthese complaints from employees in my travels, not only from \nyour hearings.\n     I cannot emphasize enough the importance that I place on \ncreating a positive working environment that is free of \ndiscrimination, reprisal and harassment, and a work place that \ninsists on accountability and open and honest communication \namong employees and management.\n     I am committed to addressing each and every complaint, and \nI also believe that the Inspector General, as proposed by your \nlegislation, will prove to be a valuable resource in addressing \nthese concerns. In addition, the disciplinary task force that I \nmentioned will also prove helpful in our efforts to combat \ndiscrimination and harassment.\n     I have also taken some other steps. I recently issued a \nmemorandum to all IRS employees, stating that they have an \nobligation to report misconduct, fraud, waste and abuse. In \nthat memo I have made it clear that the IRS has a stringent \npolicy that guarantees employees freedom from reprisal when \nthey report such action.\n     IRS employees were also provided with a description of a \nvariety of avenues for reporting misconduct.\n     I also recently issued new performance standards for \nexecutives and managers on equal employment matters. This \nstandard comes after consultation with the Departments of \nJustice and Treasury, and reaffirms our commitment to progress \nin eliminating discrimination, promoting employees based on \nmerit and qualifications and encouraging a diverse work force \nto better serve taxpayers.\n     On a broader scale, the modernization process which I have \nproposed calls for a management structure and a working \nenvironment that, over time, will create a far more positive \nworking environment. These fundamental changes include stronger \nand more direct internal communications, open employee \ncommunications with management and the ability of employees to \ngrow to their full potential; a flatter management structure \nthat will foster better communication and a team approach and a \nhigh quality and more tailored training.\n     Finally, Mr. Chairman, I would like to briefly address the \ntopic of audit selection and execution, and first I want to \nstress that this is a new area for me. I think that is actually \na distinct advantage for me and that my perspective is that I \nwill personally not believe that we are doing the right thing \nwith respect to audits until I feel I can explain the process \nto the average American taxpayer.\n     I must say that the audit process and our published \nstatistics are confusing. I mean, they were confusing to me. \nSo, I imagine they are also confusing to other people, and I \nthink, in some cases, the process is unnecessarily frightening \nfor taxpayers.\n     Over time, we must de-mystify the audit process and make \nit clear that an audit is not a signal that a taxpayer has done \nanything wrong. An audit should be used only to determine \nwhether a taxpayer has paid the correct tax liability.\n     Audit selection should never be punitive and audits should \nnever be aimed at generating any specific amount of revenue.\n     Concerns have also been raised--and have bothered me a \ngreat deal when they were raised--that IRS audits, in some way, \nunfairly target poorer taxpayers. I believe, based on what I \nhave been able to research, that this concern reflects poor \ncommunication about IRS compliance activities.\n     In my written testimony, I have included a table of audit \nstatistics, which I hope will begin to shed some light on this. \nOne of the confusing points in the past is that there are two \nspecial categories of activities, which comprise 45 percent of \nwhat the IRS reported last year as audits.\n     One category is audits of taxpayers who filed no return at \nall. The second is taxpayers who claimed the earned income tax \ncredit, which is an area that the Congress has asked the IRS to \npay special attention to because of the historically high rates \nof over-claims in that area.\n     So, for the remaining 55 percent of what were classified \nas audits, which actually comprise all audits of the individual \ntaxpayers who filed returns and did not claim an earned income \ntax credit, the statistics and the tables show two important \npoints.\n     One, the chance of a low income taxpayer being audited is \nonly about one-half of 1 percent. And second, the chance of a \ntaxpayer with income over $100,000 being audited is about four \nand a half times as high as for a low-income taxpayer.\n     Audit coverage also varies widely from district to \ndistrict, as you heard in some earlier testimony, and this is \npartly because incomes and compliance vary widely. The \npopulation is not homogeneous from district to district. This \nis a matter that we need to do a better job of explaining as \nwell.\n     And with respect to the conduct of individual audits, \nultimately proper management and supervision, in which quality \nstandards are the paramount concern, is of utmost importance. \nAs with all areas of the IRS, the role of the new independent \nInspector General investigating any instance of improper \ninfluence of an audit will also be essential.\n     And once again, I am convinced, Mr. Chairman, that the \nlong-term solution to some of the audit concerns lies in the \nmodernization concept that I have advanced. I believe it will \nallow better management of compliance resources on a nationwide \nbasis, and our focus on helping customers comply will stress \npreventing problems before they occur and intervening as early \nas possible, through such things as problem prevention days and \nother forms of assistance.\n     I pledge to the committee that in designing the new \norganization we will place great emphasis on control over audit \nselection.\n    Mr. Chairman, last October I commented that the renewed \ninterest of Congress in IRS management issues is an essential \nforce for positive change. Six months later, I still firmly \nbelieve that.\n     I realize that so far we have only taken some first steps \ntowards addressing some very large problems. Much more needs to \nbe done and will be done. Fundamentally changing the way the \nIRS does business is a long-term process requiring a long-term \ncommitment from both the Congress and the management.\n     I am here today, again, to pledge myself to that goal and \nto our partnership. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Commissioner Rossotti.\n     Let me again stress the importance of all of us working \ntogether to bring about the kind of change we want to see in \nthis organization, and I congratulate you for the steps that \nyou have already taken. As you know, they are only a beginning.\n     You are absolutely correct. We are talking about changing \nthe culture of a major organization consisting of roughly \n100,000 employees. So, it is going to take cooperation and \nworking together between the executive and Congressional group \nto get the job done.\n     I have a couple of questions that you did cover in your \nopening statements, and we will include your full statement as \nif read. But I think these two areas are of sufficient interest \nand importance. It is worthwhile going over them again.\n     As you know, one of the major concerns that came out, \nparticularly from the employees as well as the taxpayers and \ntaxpayer representatives, was concern about retaliation. Many \nof the employees really were extraordinarily fearful of coming \nbefore us; that they would face, when they went back to their \njobs, retaliation, abuse, and possible loss of jobs. That \nshould not be the case.\n     Any employee should have the right to appear before the \nappropriate committees of Congress without fear, and I know you \nfeel as strongly about that as I do.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Yes, Mr. Chairman. I do. I have \nmade that clear in every way that I can. I do plan, next week, \nto reinforce that in a specific way, which is to send a memo \naround to the right offices, specifically reinforcing that with \nrespect to the employees that appeared here.\n     I will do that, and we will send you a copy of that. But I \nthink, more generally than that, I have been trying, through my \nown activities, to reinforce the notion that all employees \nshould be free to speak. Not only to your committee, but to me \nand to other people inside the agency that they want to speak \nto to raise problems, because as I said in my confirmation \nhearing, it is the only way we are going to ever solve \nproblems, is to acknowledge them and bring them out into the \nopen.\n    The Chairman. I know that you feel as strongly as I do \nabout this. I just think it is important that we make it clear \nthat all of us, to the best of our ability, will take steps to \ninsure that those who come before us, whistleblowers, whomever, \ndo so without fear of retaliation.\n     Nobody, frankly, can guarantee 100 percent that that will \nhappen, but we will do our level best to protect them.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Yes, sir. Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman. I \npledge that to you, and I have said that internally, and I will \nreinforce it again next week.\n    The Chairman. A second matter of concern is that there were \na number of problems raised, and initially, you talked about \nhaving them investigated by the Inspection Office. Frankly, \nthat is the only alternative you have.\n     But again, I think it is important for everybody to \nunderstand that we all agree that the questions that have been \nraised in some of these cases ought to be investigated by the \nComptroller General.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Mr. Chairman, I welcome that. I \nthink that is a very appropriate way to go, and I will pledge \nto work with them any way that I can to make sure they get the \ninformation they need and get access to anything that they \nneed.\n     And, of course, after they finish their investigations, \nthey will have to provide a report, and we will have to take \nactions, if there are substantiations of misconduct.\n     And I also pledge that we will insure that that is done \nvery rigorously.\n    The Chairman. We think that assurance is critically \nimportant, and I appreciate that.\n     Let me turn to what I consider a primary message of the \nhearings this week."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Mr. Chairman, could I just, for a moment, \nadd to your problems by saying it is all very good to have the \nConptroller General look into these matters, but we do not have \na Conptroller General.\n    The Chairman. You are correct. But we do have a General \nAccounting Office."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    That is your next set of hearings, sir.\n    The Chairman. Right. It is critically important that we \nhave a new Conptroller General, but we do have a General \nAccounting Office, and we will refer these matters, as you say.\n     That has to be done by us. It cannot be done by you. But I \nthink it is important that the record be clear that we agree \nthat this is the way to proceed.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Yes, sir.\n    The Chairman. Now, I would like to go back to the question \nof management, of which you are an expert. But, as I said, I \nthink the primary message that has come out from the hearings \nwe have had these last several days is that there has been a \nvery serious failure for the managers of this agency.\n     And we are not talking about your administration. You have \njust been here a brief time. We are talking about the past.\n     As I have already indicated, there is an internal climate \nof fear, retaliation that, frankly, demoralizes the employees. \nThe statistical indicators of agency performance have been \nshown to be unreliable.\n     Paramilitary techniques are being used against non-violent \ncitizens, racial discrimination, sexual harassment appear to be \ncommonplace, and we have even heard evidence of what appears to \nbe, in a sense, extortion, framing and zeroing out of high \ndollar liabilities.\n     So this tells me that management, the managers responsible \nfor the day-to-day operations of IRS, are not doing their jobs. \nI do not know how else to account for the state of affairs.\n     As you know, I feel you will not be successful in your \nefforts to turn this agency around until you have new people in \ntop management positions that you trust and in whom you have \nconfidence, and I have, of course, expressed this concern on \nseveral different occasions. The committee has placed, in the \nnew reform bill, additional tools for you to accomplish this \ngoal, which we will take up next week.\n     But the point I want to make very strongly is that it is \ntime for a change. You have been in your job a few months now. \nI would appreciate hearing from you what progress you are \nmaking in this regard and what are your plans for the future.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want \nto commend the work that you have done in putting additional \nprovisions in the legislation, because I think that is going to \nbe very helpful.\n     Of course, the most important thing that we need to do to \nimprove the agency is to get the right people in the right \njobs, and this is the thing that I probably spend more time on \nthan anything else.\n     Of course, this is not a matter that is so easy to do, \nbecause even getting people from the inside, finding the right \npeople from the inside to move to right jobs is difficult, but \nit is even more difficult getting people from outside to come \ninto the IRS. It is something that takes some time and is a \nchallenge.\n     So, it is going to take me some time to make these kinds \nof moves; however, I will tell you--I think as I said in my \nconfirmation hearing--that I agree that getting the right kind \nof people, the right people that I select personally into the \nright jobs ultimately is paramount; of paramount importance, \nand I have been working on that in a number of different \ndirections.\n     In terms of specific positions, I have, at this point, \nonly filled a few. I did appoint, just within the last couple \nof weeks from inside the IRS, a person I have considerable \nconfidence in as representative of what I consider the new IRS \nof the future. He has been appointed to the position of Chief \nof Operations, which is a key position.\n     I am working on three other positions right now that I am \npersonally recruiting on, one of which I hope will be filed \nfairly soon. But this is also going to require a sustained \nlevel of effort really over a couple of years.\n     It is not something, to find people and to put people in \nthe right place, that is going to be done overnight. So, I \ncertainly would concur with your observation that getting the \nright people in the right jobs is paramount.\n     And as I pledged at the beginning here, that is the thing \nthat I will spend probably as much time on as anything else.\n     And finally, let me just say, once again, the legislation \nwill really be very helpful in doing this because I have found \nalready it is quite challenging, especially when you have to \nbring in people from outside. Not everybody wants to work for \nthe IRS right now, and you have to find ways to attract them.\n    The Chairman. Not everybody wants to work for government \nright now I believe.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. That is right. But there are people \nwho are attracted to the challenge. I mean, truthfully, it is \nremarkable that there are people who really have no reason to \nwant to come, other than because of the public service \nopportunity that they see. We just have to find a way to grease \nthe skids a little bit to make it as easy for them as possible."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Mr. Chairman, I think we have one such \nperson before us.\n    The Chairman. Absolutely. As both of us have said before, \nSenator Moynihan, we are fortunate to have this individual in \nwhat I think is, without question, as difficult a job as there \nis in government this time. That is also part of the fun and \nthe challenge I would say.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. This is my selling point when I am \ntrying to attract these people.\n    The Chairman. You are right. We are trying to give you the \ntools that will help you with that. I understand it is \ndifficult. I know that it is difficult to get people in the \nprivate sector, many times, to come into government.\n     Unfortunately, at the same time, there is nothing more \nimportant, as I said, than having a new team in place to bring \nabout the kind of changes that you and I want. I recognize your \nproblems, but I want to keep pushing you as fast as I can.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Mr. Chairman, I think I welcome not \nonly you pushing me, but also, you helping me with some of \nthese other provisions. All I can say is that I am working as \nhard as I possibly can to do that, and I think we are making \nsome progress.\n     I really hope that within the next few months we will have \nsome additional results. I think we have made some progress, \nbut there is more in the pipeline than there is to show out of \nthe pipeline so far, I have to say.\n    The Chairman. Let me turn to another thing, if I may, \nCommissioner Rossotti, which you did make some reference to in \nyour opening comments, and that is my concern about the \nintrusive type of investigation that has been made with non-\nviolent taxpayers.\n     As you said, and I agree strongly, one case is one case \ntoo many. We had one witness who pointed out that 15 years ago \nwe processed and succeeded in indicting and convicting those \nthat were evading paying their taxes without these extreme \nmeasures.\n     The charge has been made, for example, that part of the \nproblem is that CID, in some of its activities of money \nlaundering, organized crime and so forth, have to use some \npretty extreme measures, but that somehow that practice has \nbeen carried over to the non-violent, and that is outrageous if \nit is even one.\n     Now, Congress may be partly responsible for that, because \nif you go back, as I understand it, we expanded the \njurisdiction, the requirements of IRS, into some of these other \nfields where you are involved with drug dealers, violent \norganized crime and things of that sort.\n     But as I said, 15 years ago we did not do this. What are \nwe going to do about that? What do you see as the solution?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Well, first of all, Mr. Chairman, I \nthink that this is another area that is new to me, and so I am \nlearning about it. But one of the things that I have learned is \nthat even in the Internal Revenue Manual, as it exists today, \nit does say and it does state that the policy, which I think is \ncertainly appropriate, is that any investigation, even of a \nperson who is suspected of criminal activity, should be done \nwith the least intrusive techniques that are available, that \nare possible.\n     And I think the questions that were raised in your \nhearings certainly throw in the question of whether that policy \nwas being followed. Now, why that came about is something that \nI do not know, but this is precisely why I decided, some time \nago, that for this complicated area we needed to do a thorough \nreview, a really thorough review of what techniques, among \nother things, the CID was using.\n     Judge Webster will be leading that review, together with, \nby the way, a very able colleague, a former colleague of his \nthat will assist him, Mr. Shaheen, who is the head of the \nOffice of Professional Responsibility, together with people \nfrom other agencies, not from the Treasury Department, to help \nthem.\n     They are going to look precisely at those kinds of \nquestions. How are the decisions made to decide whether search \nwarrants or undercover activities, or those kinds of things, \nshould be----"
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Or body armor and automatic weapons.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Yes."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    That is what surprised, I think, Mr. \nChairman.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. I think all of the questions that \nwere raised in your hearing, whether the techniques were \nappropriate, as you put it, whether the arming of agents was \nappropriate, what should be done in tax cases, which are about \n60 percent of the cases, the other 40 percent being the illegal \nincome cases--I really believe that with this review we will \nget a very thorough review of that and recommendations as to \nhow we can insure that the policy of using the least intrusive \ntechniques would be applied in every investigation.\n     And, of course, that will be a recommendation, but I have \npromised Judge Webster--he did not want to take on this job \nunless he was really convinced that it was a serious review \nthat was really going to be acted upon based on what he found.\n     Both Secretary Rubin and I have met with him, and based on \nthat, he did agree to accept, because he, I think, concluded \nthat we are serious about looking into this and taking action \non the results of what he finds.\n    The Chairman. I also talked with Bill Webster. It is a good \nselection. The number two man is excellent. So that is an \nextraordinarily important initiative.\n     Let me turn to another matter, which I find unbelievable. \nI think it is intrusive.\n     We heard from witnesses this week; that in order to \npressure a taxpayer to plead guilty, CID would open cases \nagainst uninvolved family members in order to extract a plea \nagreement from the primary suspect. In other words, they would \ninclude innocent members of the families as means of bringing \npressure on the taxpayer from whom they seek to take corrective \naction.\n     All of us consider our family our most precious asset. \nThat bothers me very much. I wonder what you think of that \napproach.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Again, I think, as with all of the \nIRS' activities, they should only be taken with the specific \npurpose that they are designed to be. If there is an \ninvestigation of an individual, it should be designed because \nthere is reason to believe that that individual has potentially \ncommitted some crime, not as some kind of corollary tactic.\n     And I think that this is another matter that will be \nincluded within the scope of Judge Webster's review.\n    The Chairman. I would urge that, because I, frankly, think \nit is outrageous that such intrusive pressures can involve an \ninnocent child, spouse, or other family member.\n     Let me ask one more question, and then I will turn to \nSenator Moynihan.\n     We have received information, again, that I find \ndisturbing. Are you aware of any undercover operations where \nCID agents have posed as certified public accountants to the \ngeneral public? Do you feel that is appropriate?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. I do not know about that matter, \nMr. Chairman. I simply do not have information on that. I don't \nknow.\n    The Chairman. I wish you would investigate, because it \nbothers me, Pat; that you go to a CPA that person may not be \nwhat they're representing."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Entrapment.\n    The Chairman. It is entrapment. Yes. Under our legislation \nnext week, we are providing that CPAs maintain confidential \ninformation in the same manner that attorney/client \nrelationships do. And to have them use this, what I call a very \nintrusive practice, I think is, frankly, outrageous, un-\nAmerican, and I would hope that you look into it.\n     I have taken considerable time, and I will turn to my good \nfriend and colleague, Senator Moynihan."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have two \nquestions, neither of which I have answer. That is why I put \nthem to you.\n     On the Year 2000 matter, in March 31st, I mentioned \nearlier, you sent us a long letter with very specific dates \nabout specific provisions. Do I take that as still your view \nand that we ought to discuss the matter on the floor?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. I do not know where you should \ndiscuss the matter."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Yes. Yes.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. I know that the Chairman has \ncommitted to working with us on this. I do believe that very \nmuch, Senator Moynihan. I do believe that we have to work out a \nrealistic schedule. It is very regrettable.\n     It is very regrettable that we have to devote our \nresources to something that, in essence, just keeps us even. It \ndoes not get us ahead."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    And you are hardly alone.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. No. I know we are not alone, but \nthe consequences are visible in this letter because we are \nseeing that there are desirable provisions that all of us would \nlike to see implemented earlier.\n     But when I look at the situation we are in at the IRS, and \nI am only focusing on the IRS, we have almost a $1 billion \nprogram over a multi-year period of time, which is----"
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    This is to get your computers in \ncompliance so that they can move from the 20th century to the \n21st century without going all array, because we only have two \nletters designating the year in the current programs.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Right. But doing that at the IRS, \nespecially with the old systems we have, is going to cost, over \nthe whole period, close to $1 billion. Now, it is not just the \nmoney.\n     The public companies are now required to report how much \nthey are spending. So, I happened to see, in the press the \nother day, that General Motors reported to the SEC they are \nspending between $360 million and $500 million.\n     Our program is twice the size of General Motors, and I \nknow that we do not have twice the management resources of \nGeneral Motors. Not close to it.\n     That being the case, we have to add to that, by the way, \nfor this calendar year, the next 8 months, about 800 changes \nthat are stemming form last year's tax bill, the 1997 tax bill."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    You don't say.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. We have to put those in this \nsummer."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    There were 820 pages. So that is about \nright.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Well, it translates to about 750, \n800 computer changes. I mean, individual changes to different \nparts of the system. Those are the same people that are doing \nthe century day change.\n     So, for this calendar year, we have no choice but to be \nabsolutely focused on this problem. I have to tell you this \nconsumes time, too. Even during this week, when we were doing \nthese hearings, I had to have meetings with people to sort out \nwhat could be done and what could not be done.\n     The letter that I wrote was simply an attempt to be \nrealistic, from a practical standpoint of when it is likely \nthat we would be able to address additional changes."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    The letter said, we are happy to comply, \nwe want to comply, but the time pressures are such that there \nare certain dates we cannot get to.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Yes."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    One other question, sir. And here, you \nare talking to someone who has no legal qualifications. \nWhatever.\n     If I am troubled by any one thing that we are doing, if I \nam told I am ought to be, it is this question of the burden of \nproof in civil procedures, and it is so easily misunderstood \nwhen we are told the burden of proof is on you and not the \ngovernment.\n     But we had four of your predecessors, respected persons \nall; tax lawyers, saying that if we shift the burden of proof \nto the government, where, of course, it does exist in a \ncriminal proceeding, the auditing process would become much \nmore intrusive, and the taxpayer will find life is more \ndifficult, not less, because of the record keeping required.\n     Do you have any thoughts?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Again, I am not a tax lawyer \neither. So, this is a new topic to me."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    There are some lawyers behind you.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Yes. I know. Well, I have been \ntrying to learn about it, from a practical standpoint, and I do \nnot claim to be an expert in this.\n     But I think the way I understand it is that the risk that \nyou cite, Senator Moynihan, of it potentially backfiring, does \nexist, and it depends on the details of how it is done.\n     If what is meant by the burden of proof is that when a \nmatter arrives for adjudication in court say, the issue is if \nboth parties, the IRS and the taxpayer, have roughly an \nequivalent case, then the taxpayer should win. That does not \nseem to present any problem. I mean, that is fine.\n     I think there are some other interpretations here though, \nwhich I think the Chairman and the staff are trying to work \nwith the IRS to deal with, which could give rise to a broader \ninterpretation of what is meant by this burden of proof, which \ncould imply, for example, that taxpayers might believe that \nsimply by not retaining their records or not retaining as many \nrecords, that therefore, they would have an advantage.\n     That, I think, is where the risk comes in, because then \nyou would have nothing to do except have the IRS go in and try \nto find this information, which then leads down a path which I \ndo not think any of us want.\n     So, it is a matter which requires careful and pretty \ntechnical work, I think, to make sure that you get it right. I \nthink there certainly is a legitimate concern that there should \nnot be a case where the taxpayer has equal proof, so to speak, \nand loses the case. That should not be.\n    But this matter of making sure it does not become more \nintrusive, that is very important also. So that is going to \nhave to be worked very carefully. I think at the staff level."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Good. I can indicate, sir, that there are \nsome wise heads nodding in the first row behind you.\n    Commissioner Rossotti. Well, if I got through that one, \nthen I am in pretty good shape."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Mr. Chairman, I have a statement by \nSenator Bob Kerrey about the hearings, which includes a number \nof proposals, of which the one you will, no doubt, be \nappreciative of; that we should require that the committee meet \nevery year on a set date, say the second Tuesday of May, to do \nthe kind of oversight that we have been doing this year.\n     I would like to place this in the record at this point.\n    The Chairman. Without objection."

"","","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","OPENING STATEMENT OF HON."
break,break,break,break
"","","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Senator Gramm. Mr. Chairman, let me first note that our \nprovision, transferring the burden of proof, has been well \nreasoned, and, in fact, a condition for getting the transfer of \nthe burden of proof is turning over full data to the IRS and \nkeeping data that a prudent person could be expected to keep.\n     When I look at our bill, that is one of the provisions I \nfeel strongest about. In fact, after the hearings this week, I \nam convinced that our bill is inadequate to meet the task.\n    Mr. Chairman, I hope we are going to get at least two \nrounds, because I am going to use this first round as an \nopening statement.\n     I want to begin by congratulating you. If these reforms \nare successful, I think that it will be one of the things in \nyour career that you are going to be remembered for, and you \ndid it. There were a lot of people who were very skeptical \nabout these hearings, and I would have to say that I was among \nthem.\n     I expected to hear a group of malcontents complain. In an \norganization of 100,000 people, you have always got people who \nare unhappy. I expected some isolated abuses, but I would have \nto say that these hearings have totally changed my viewpoint.\n     I have no confidence in the Internal Revenue Service of \nthis country. It is not that I am so unhappy to find that \npeople do bad things. People do bad things. Smart people do \nstupid things.\n     But what has totally undermined my confidence is that \nnothing seems to be done about it. There seems to be a system, \nwhich more than anything else, was designed to protect \nwrongdoers; to see that people are not held accountable, and I \nthink this is critically important.\n     If you get a new team, that may produce short-run changes \nin the system. But you have got to have a change in the system. \nLet me tell you what I think is wrong at IRS.\n     I think the system is a bad system. I think you are \ndealing with human beings, and you have got some people who do \nbad things; some people who do dumb things. We experience that \nhere where we work.\n     But the difference between a good system and a bad system \nis a good system rewards good behavior and punishes bad \nbehavior, and a bad system does the reverse. I believe you have \na bad system.\n     I do not think you are going to change the system \npermanently by simply having new management, though I believe \nyou need it in the short-term. And I believe that you need to \ntake a long, hard look, and we need to take a long, hard look, \nat how the Internal Revenue service is structured.\n     I am still totally convinced that the problem is this \nagency has too much unchecked power. An agency in a free \nsociety should never have the ability to investigate, evaluate \nand basically prosecute, all wrapped up into one. There clearly \nis an absence of checks and balances within this agency, and I \nthink it needs to be changed.\n     I also believe that we need to take a long, hard look at \nthe things that I have happened, and I am concerned, quite \nfrankly, that you do not have, even under our new bill, the \nability to do some of the things that need to be done.\n     So, I think we have got to have fundamental changes. And \none of the things that I am doing, as we get ready to go to the \nfloor with our bill, is to look back and see how we might \naddress this problem with a lack of check and balance.\n     I am not sure how you do it, but all I know is that \ncompared to the criminal justice system, where you have got \nchecks at each level, where the police do the investigation and \nthen their investigation is evaluated by a grand jury and by a \nprosector, that by the very nature of the two being from \ndifferent departments of government, they valuate each other.\n     They represent checks and balances on the behavior of each \nother. And then, if you are in the criminal justice system, you \nget to go into a court where you have got an elected judge; you \nhave got 12 jurors who hopefully are independent of the whole \nprocess.\n     So, you have got checks and balances at each phase of the \nprocess. With the Internal Revenue Service, you have no \nexternal checks, and I think, basically, that is the problem. \nBut it very difficult to fix it.\n     I guess I have used up my first round, but that basically \nis the sad, but firm conclusion that I have reached as a result \nof sitting through the vast majority of these hearings.\n     This is going to be very difficult to fix, but I am \nconvinced that we have got to undertake the process. And again, \nI want to thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Gramm.\n    Senator Mack."

"","","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","  OPENING STATEMENT OF HON."
break,break,break,break
"","","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Senator Mack. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, as I have \nindicated several times this week, want to commend you and \nSenator Moynihan for these hearings. And I also want to commend \nthe staff for the work they have done on these hearings.\n     I think that they have been extremely enlightening. I find \nmyself agreeing with Senator Gramm in the comments that he has \nmade. I think one of the things that kind of shook me was the \nrealization--or at least my understanding of it, and I must \nadmit that that is a limited understanding.\n     My understanding of what we heard this week is, again, \nthat there are limited checks and balances that are in place. \nAnd I think one of the things I would suspect that you are \ntaking a look at, being someone known for his management \ncapabilities, is what kind of a system do you put in place; \nwhat kind of levels of authority do individuals have; what kind \nof limits are placed on their authority; what kind of controls \nare in place to evaluate those limits are being lived up to.\n     So again, I commend you and the staff for the work that \nyou have done. These have been outstanding hearings. I think \nthat the suggestion that Senator Kerrey apparently made and \nSenator Moynihan mentioned a few minutes ago; that the only way \nthere is going to be a guarantee in place that we are going to \ncontinue this oversight effort is to, in essence, kind of \nrequire that it be done in a systematic way, and I think that \nis a very important suggestion.\n    Mr. Rossotti, there is really only kind of one area for me \nto pursue. The Chairman has kind of asked us, really, not to go \ninto individual cases that were raised, and I had really come \nhere intending to look at those and raise questions in those \nindividual areas.\n     You have an incredibly difficult job. You know that better \nthan we do, and it is probably a lot more difficult than you \nthought when you accepted the position.\n     But one of the messages that we heard this week is that it \nis business as usual though with the IRS. In fact, one of the \npeople who testified this week said--in fact, a couple of them \ndid. In essence, they said everything is continuing to happen \nas it has been happening all along. The oversight hearings \naren't bothering us.\n     We heard that the southeast region may still be evaluating \ndistricts according to their number of property seizures, and \nas I understand, this is not supposed to happen. But this was a \nreport dated January of this year, after the September \nhearings.\n     So this leads me to this point and question: How many of \nthe top executives are still in place? And I am going to be \nfairly specific. I am going to name one name, Michael Dolan.\n     We heard in the testimony that the Inspector General \ninvestigated and substantiated allegations of travel fraud, \nabuse of subordinates, sexual harassment, fraudulent \nperformance appraisals and orders to cover up illegal actions, \nall against IRS executives.\n     Yet, in each and every case, the report from the IG was \nsent to the deputy commissioner's desk--I believe Michael \nDolan--and no disciplinary action was taken. And here is my \npoint. My intention is not to go after individuals.\n     But how are you going to get a message to the people \nthroughout the organization that things are going to be \ndifferent if nothing is changing?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. First of all, Senator, I think even \nbefore I got in office, when I was here before this committee \nfor confirmation, I pointed out that getting across a message \nand actually effecting change in a place as large as the IRS, \nwhile you have to continue to operate every day, isn't like \nbuilding it from scratch and just moving into it. You have to \nkeep running.\n     We just finished a filing season, for example, that \nprocessed quite a few tax returns. For these reasons, it does \ntake some time and change has to be done step by step.\n     From the point of view of the message though, I think that \nat least for most of the people at the IRS there is a message \nthat it is a new day at the IRS. Now, there are always going to \nbe some people who do not get the word, and there may have been \nsomebody down in the southeast region who did not. We are going \nto track that down and find out what it is.\n     But to really change it, it is not just a matter of what \nyou stop or what you tell people you are going to do. It is \nactually putting in place new things; positive things that \nactually are different than what the other ones were.\n     Part of this, as the Chairman mentioned, is putting people \nin place. I have been doing that incrementally. I have got one \nnew regional commissioner that I have selected. I have got a \nnew person I have just put in for chief of operations. I have \ngot several people that I am getting in from the outside, if I \ncan recruit them in from the outside.\n     This is not something that we can do instantly while \ncontinuing to operate an organization, but I am working on it \nevery day.\n     On the matter of statistics, if there is anybody at the \nIRS who does not understand that we are not going to use \nenforcement statistics as a measure of individual employee \nperformance, then that is a person who has not heard a pretty \nloud message.\n     We do, however, on that matter have a problem, and it is a \nvery significant problem, which I think is worth my mentioning \nto the committee, and that is that you cannot run an \norganization like the IRS without having some kind of measures \nin place that measure how things are going.\n     So we have said we are going to take away a lot of \nmeasures. We have not yet been able to come forward with very \ngood guidance, very precise guidance, as to how we should be \nmeasuring performance, which leaves it, in a sense--it leaves a \nvacuum to some degree.\n     We are working very hard to devise a new set of measures \nthat will be appropriate. We have a task force working. We have \nan outside consultant. I am hoping that we can get some very \nshort-term interim guidance out fairly quickly. But in reality, \nwe won't really have even an interim set of reasonable measures \nout until fiscal 1999.\n     And this is just one of many different areas of change \nthat we are working on that take time to do. So, your basic \nobservation is how do we effect change in this kind of a large \norganization. It is, of course, the big question that I am \ntrying to address, and I think the answer to that question is \nthat it will be done step by step, over a period of time, by \nsystematically working through each of these areas.\n     Getting the right people in the right jobs. If necessary, \nwhere there is misconduct or if there are substantiations of \nallegations, most certainly getting people out of jobs or taken \naction against them is substantiated. But even that takes time.\n     Since I have gotten here, I have initiated investigations \nthat so far have produced 14,000 pages of reports of \ninvestigation of potential misconduct. They have just started \nto be delivered to me, and we have just submitted those to this \nindependent panel. I could go on.\n     The question of performance measures and getting rid of \nperformance measures that are inappropriate, such as saying we \nwon't use measure of enforcement action to evaluate any \nemployee or manager, we have done that.\n     There may be some people who didn't get the word. We will \ntake care of that. But we have to put something in its place. \nWe have to have something to measure how performance goes in a \n100,000 person organization. Step by step.\n    Senator Mack. My question though, I think, is more has \nanyone lost their job as a result of both the hearings from \nlast September and your initial review?\n     I mean, Senator Gramm talked about the need to change the \nsystem. In many of the things that you have said today, you \ntalked about policies being violated. A violation of policy \ngenerally is the result of an individual choice, a decision \nmade by a manager.\n     My point for pressing this is the sense around the country \nis that it always business as usual in Washington. And so, if \nthe team that created the mess that we are pursuing is still in \nplace, the message has got to be, both to the people in the \ncountry, and I would think to those in the IRS who have been \nviolating these polices, it is business as usual.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. The issue of individual \nresponsibility for misconduct is, in the IRS, in Federal \nGovernment, as well as even in private sector, something that \nhas to be substantiated.\n     I mean, to put something on an individual person you have \nto go through a process of investigation to determine, in a \nvery factual way, exactly what those allegations--whether those \nallegation were substantiated and then you have to take action \nbased on that.\n     In order to eliminate the possibility that people could \nassume that it was business as usual, that it was a white-wash, \nI set up an entire process to try to deal with that. Now, it \ntakes time. It takes more time than I would like in some cases.\n     I have no other way to do it. I have to set up \ninvestigations, I have to get them done, I have to go through \nthe process and then we have to take action. And all I can say \nis that I can assure you, and I can assure the rest of the \ncommittee, that we are committed to doing that.\n     I cannot assure you that I can do it any faster than the \nprocess allows.\n    Senator Mack. Well, I am going to let it go at that, Mr. \nChairman. I think I have made my point.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Mack.\n    Senator Chafee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to join \nSenator Gramm in saying you have had a good year, Mr. Chairman, \nin these hearings, plus the previous action. Now your name is a \nnoun. We see advertisements: ``Do you have your Roth yet?''\n     You have had a significantly successful 6 months or so.\n    Mr. Rossotti, I think it is important that we stress that \nwhile you are trying to make these changes, the organization \nhas to go on. We have just completed now the collection of--\nwhat is it? Your organization has collected $1.5 trillion. Is \nthat right?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. I think it might be 1.6 or 1.7.\n    Senator Chafee. That is not billions. That is trillions.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Yes, sir.\n    Senator Chafee. And you processed something like 120 \nmillion tax returns in the past couple of months. So, you have \ngot a heavy duty. And one, I want to commend you and the people \nyou have selected to help you from outside, Judge Webster and \nCharles Bowsher, whom both of us had very fine experiences, as \nyou recall and I recall.\n     Let me say this: I can only believe that in your efforts \nto deal with personnel you are having to struggle with civil \nservice regulations. Is that true?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Yes, sir.\n    Senator Chafee. I had a very fine staffer who went up to my \nhome state to become head of the largest department, and she \nreported to me later that she could not hire and she could not \nfire anyone. So, it is a lot hard to bring reforms about. That \nis under the state civil service system.\n     But what about you? Do you have struggles? It is one thing \nto say we are going to replace a head of this division or that \narea, but I suspect it is a lot harder than you had it with \nAMS.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Yes. It is harder, but I think a \npart of it is a matter of--what it boils down to is a matter of \ntime. Senator Mack indicated some impatience. I have to share \nit, having come from the outside; that we ought to be able to \nmove faster on some of these points.\n     I suppose that that is just part of the character of being \nin public service, but I do not think it makes it impossible. I \nthink it just changes the time frame. If you are willing and \nyou are committed to make changes, you can do them, but it does \ntake longer.\n     The other point that I think is important is that the new \nlegislation that this committee has recently approved, and \nwhich I hope will go on the floor soon, will give us some great \nhelp on these areas. Particularly with respect to bringing in \npeople from the outside in the senior ranks and also making \nsome other changes in how performance is measured. So it will \nbe very helpful.\n     I do want to thank you for your comment about the \noperational aspect of the agency. I mean, the other limiting \nfactor, in terms of change, is that we have to continue to run. \nI mean, this is an enormous, enormous organization, in terms of \nthe money it processes, and it does work from an operational \nstandpoint.\n     So, while there are very serious problems and major \nchanges that need to be done, we have to do them in such a way \nthat is carefully calculated to not upset something that has to \nbe done. You just don't run a tax season with 120 million tax \nreturns without anybody managing it.\n     I certainly can't do that by myself, and I can't instantly \nchange around all the people that are doing this. So it does \nrequire some attention to operations while you are continuing \nto make these changes.\n    Senator Chafee. I was shocked, as was the other members of \nthis committee, by the testimony we have had and the incidents \nthat were accounted. It just dumfounded me.\n     One of the things that deeply bothered me that has been \ntouched on here before is the fact that the members of the \nCriminal Investigative Division carry firearms. That has been \ntouched on before. It just seems totally unnecessary. I do not \nthink they are going to engage in a gun fight, are they, as \nthey come in to get somebody's records.\n     I didn't understand it at all. What is the rationale for \nthem having guns?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Rather than my giving a rationale, \nsince I haven't been here long enough to know what the history \nof it is, I think it is better for me to say what I think we \nneed to investigate that question.\n    Senator Chafee. All right.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Which is exactly why I have got \nsomebody with the experience of Judge Webster, who even though \nhe is from law enforcement, was a judge and who I think has \nvery broad experience in determining what----\n    Senator Chafee. And he is going to report back on that? He \nis going to look into that?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. He is going to look into all the \nquestions that are really fundamental to how the CID, Criminal \nInvestigative Division, should operate. Certainly what kind of \nweapons they should carry and in what circumstances would be an \nappropriate part of that.\n    Senator Chafee. You come from a management background. \nIndeed, the very name of your was American Management Systems. \nI am curious, and you touched on this a little bit in your \ntestimony.\n     All right. So we do not want to judge the productivity of \nthe unit by the number of enforcement results that they have \nhad, but how else? You have got to have some criteria by which \nyou can judge the productivity of a unit. What else are you \ngoing to do?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Senator, this is exactly what I was \ntrying to get to in my previous answer. This is a very, very \ndifficult question. How do we manage an agency, which basically \nhas the job of collecting money, without getting down to what I \nthink has caused significant problems? What people broadly \nrefer to as quotas.\n     I think there are some ways to do that. The most important \nway, at the individual employee level--let's take an \nexamination or a collection employee--is to develop measures of \ncase quality and inventory management, which is getting \nsomebody to rate how well you are doing on a sample of cases \nand focus on the quality, which takes into account not only how \nwell you have collected, but how well you have treated the \ncustomer and so forth.\n     These are all new things for the IRS. I mean, this is why \nit isn't so fast. I mean, it has taken years and years. I think \nI have got something that says at least 25 years things have \nbeen done a certain way. Now we have said we are not going to \nuse these kind of quotas, but we are still going to, of course, \ntrack information about how much money we collect.\n     So what we have is some confusion. Frankly, we have \nconfusion in the near term over exactly what we can manage by \nand what we cannot manage by. We tried to give out some interim \nguidance. What we are working on, which we hope we will have at \nleast preliminary results for next fiscal year, is some \nguidance that will give managers more explicit guidance over \nwhat it is that they are allowed to measure and how they would \nmeasure it, and more explicitly, what they are not allowed to \nmeasure.\n     As long as we are in this vacuum where we said you can't \ndo this, but we haven't been explicit about what you are \nsupposed to do, we have a problem. I am being very honest about \nit. It is not a simple problem to solve. If it was that simple, \nI would have already done it. But I do not think it is \nimpossible.\n     It is like a lot of things. I do not think it is \nimpossible to do this. I think we need to use some creativity. \nThere are some techniques.\n     I think generally we know which direction we want to go \nin, but getting them in place for the huge range of activities \nthat exist at the IRS is not something that one can do \novernight.\n     So, I think what I would like to do at certain points in \ntime, when the Chairman thinks it is appropriate, is to not \nonly come and talk about what we have stopped doing, but be \nable to come in and say, look, here is how we are going to try \nto solve the problem that you have identified and get the \nreactions of the committee and other people because this will \nbe an evolving solution over several years.\n    Senator Chafee. Well, it seems to me that you have got to \nsome indicia, some criteria by which you go by.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. We do.\n    Senator Chafee. And like so many things, you are dependent \nupon the quality of the supervising people to differentiate \nbetween what just is mass statistics and what is a capable \nemployee who is solving the problem and getting on with things.\n     Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Chafee.\n     And, Senator Conrad."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, \nCommissioner Rossotti, for being here, and thank you for taking \nthe job, because this is, as everybody has indicated, a very \ntough challenge. But, in a way, that can be exhilarating as \nwell.\n     But I know for somebody of your background who has been so \nsuccessful in the private sector, building a company as \ndramatically as you did, there must be days when you wake up \nand say, why did I do this? Or your wife says it for you.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. That is a more accurate commentary. \nYes, sir. I guess I didn't take an oath, but I still can't deny \nwhat you said."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    I am sure. I just know that you must be \ngoing through that, and this week must have been that kind of a \nweek.\n     Nonetheless, this is critically important to our country, \nand the challenge that you have taken on is a very important \none. I think we could all agree that the vast majority of IRS \nemployees are honest and hardworking. That was certainly my \nexperience.\n     As you know, I was tax commissioner of my state. I elected \nand served in that position for 6 years before coming to the \nUnited States Senate. So I had a long history of involvement \nwith the Internal Revenue Service. And I must say, in the \ndistrict that I worked and the state that I worked, my \nexperience with the Internal Revenue Service was very positive.\n     I found lots of very dedicated career employees who \ngenuinely wanted to do a good job and treat people \nappropriately. But it is also true that, from time to time, we \nfound IRS operations that we found baffling, in terms of \ntreatment of people.\n     I think we can also acknowledge that there is some problem \nfrom the type of hearing format we have here, because we have \nheard, in essence, one side of the story. We have heard the \ncomplaints of people, but we have not been able to hear the \nother side of the story because of the secrecy provisions of \nFederal law.\n     So that makes it difficult to render a full judgment on \nwhat is really going on, but we have got to press ahead and do \nour best because that is our responsibility.\n     I think we can also acknowledge that there are a certain \nnumber of taxpayers out there who really don't have any \nintention of paying their fair share. In fact, they don't have \nany intention of paying what they legally owe, and they go, \nsometimes, to great lengths to avoid paying. I have always been \nimpressed by the creativity of some people in avoiding their \ntax obligations.\n     With all that said, there were things that we heard here \nthis week that were outrageous. I know you were outraged, from \na conversation that you and I had just the other day. I can \ntell you I was angered.\n     I must say, the day before yesterday, after hearing some \nof the testimony, I do not show it very much because I am \nScandinavian, but I tell you I was very angered by treatment of \ntaxpayers. This kind of cowboy attitude that we are going to go \nin and intimidate people. That is just unacceptable and that \nhas got to stop.\n     I was especially struck yesterday, when we heard Senator \nBaker, who is as fine a man, I think everyone here would \nacknowledge, that ever served in the United States Senate. \nSomebody who is beyond question in terms of personal integrity \nand honesty.\n     I mean, that somebody would go to great lengths to frame \nhim, that is outrageous. And it goes to individual tax \npreparers. We heard this Mr. Gardner, and he has got people, \narmed people, coming to him. This is a tax preparer. This is \nnot a violent threat. And they have got armed people coming, \nwith their law enforcement jackets emblazoned with the seal, \nand calling him out and threatening him. That is just totally \ninappropriate.\n     So, this is the abusive tactics in some of these cases, \nthe arrogance, and the lack of accountability I found \nespecially troubling.\n    Senator Gramm and I talked, before the hearing began, about \nthis lack of accountability, in many ways, being the most \ntroubling. I do not know if Senator Gramm pursued that during \nhis questioning period, but I share that view.\n     There is a sense, among some anyway, within the IRS--and I \nstress some, because again, I do not want to besmirch this \nentire agency. I know full well how many really excellent \npeople are there who do care deeply about doing a good job.\n     But among some, one gets the sense that they feel free to \nengage in inappropriate behavior, and there is no sense that \nanybody is watching the store. There is no sense that they are \ngoing to be held accountable.\n     So my question is how much of this do you see as systemic? \nHow much of this do you see as cases that represent exceptions?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Well, I think some of the more \negregious cases--I hope we do not have very many situations \nlike we found with Senator Baker. I mean, I cannot imagine that \nwe do.\n     But I think really, in some ways, my feeling is that even \none case is too many. We really cannot be in a situation where \nwe say, well, it is okay to have--you know, like we are running \nan airline and every once in a while we have plane crashes and \npeople get killed, and we say, well, statistically we are \npretty good. We run a safe airline. At least that is not the \nway I view it.\n     Each and every time, if there is anything that happens, we \nhave to try to figure out what went wrong, if there is \nsomething that went wrong, and do something about it.\n     However, I will say what I think I have said in my early \ntestimony and again today, that apart from dealing with \nindividual misdoers or misconduct, which we will certainly \nfollow up on--with the aid of GAO we will follow up on those--\nif it were simply a matter of getting rid of some wrongdoers, \nor getting rid of a few people and replacing them, my job would \nbe a whole lot easier.\n     It really is more fundamental than that, and I think that, \nin some respects, I do agree with Senator Gramm. We really have \nto deal with the whole structure of the way the agency runs.\n     The technology, believe it or not, actually has something \nto do with this because the better technology you have, the \nbetter you can track what really goes on, the better you can \nmanage individual transactions, as you know from your previous \nexperience. As it is now, it is almost impossible.\n     I went through some of the cases, for example, that were \nhere at the Senate Finance Committee, and I won't mention a \nparticular case because we are not allowed to do that. I was \nlooking at what can we do to follow up where there were clearly \nsome indications that taxpayers were mistreated. Badly treated, \nas indicated here.\n     Well, here is one that went on for 17 years. There were \nnine different organizational units that had major transactions \nthat went wrong in this unit over a period of time, and that is \norganizational units. We really don't know how many employees \nit was.\n     Many of these, in this particular case, involved some \nerror prone systems that did not necessarily cause the problem, \nbut contributed to the cause of the problem. If I look at that \nkind of situation and say, what do I do about it, yes, I want \nto try to go back and find out which employee made a mistake.\n     But really, if I have a system like this that has this set \nof transactions on it, no matter what I do to find the \nindividual employees, it is not going to solve the problem. \nTherefore, what do we do?\n     We clearly have to follow up on these individual cases, \nand we will, and we have to provide appropriate disciplinary \naction where individuals can be found to be responsible.\n     But I believe that is why I proposed a very, very \nfundamental set of changes that deals with completely revamping \nthe organizational structure to get much more accountability \nand a much flatter organizational structure that redefines the \nmanagement role so we can actually have accountability, so that \nwe don't have to go back and look over 17 different \norganizational units to figure out who was responsible.\n     To revamp these performance measures, update the \ntechnology and combine all of these things as well, I must say, \nthese are the only things we are doing internally. There are \nalso the legislative changes, which are very important.\n     There is a whole series of provisions that Senator Roth \nadded to the House bill, which deal with things like \ncollections and examinations, the kinds of activities that have \nthe most effect on taxpayers in that regard.\n     It is really the combination of all these things, which is \ngoing to take time, which I think can dramatically improve the \nway that the IRS treats individual taxpayers. I am afraid that \nwas a little bit of a long winded answer to your question, \nSenator, but that is the way I see."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Well, if I could just conclude, because my \ntime has ran out.\n     I believe a flatter management structure is important to \ndelivering services. One of the things that we learned in our \noperation is flatter management structure does a better job \nboth ways. Second, the technology does need a dramatic upgrade.\n     One of the things that always struck me when I was dealing \nwith the IRS is our information systems, at the state level, \nwere far superior to the Revenue Service's. Far superior. We \ntried to be on the cutting edge of technology because it did \nhelp us manage the case load in a way that allowed us to be \nmore responsive and more effective.\n     But the final point that I want to make to you is I also \nthink, from what I have heard, that there has got to be \nimproved feedback systems and monitoring systems to hold people \naccountable.\n     There is something wrong right at the heart of the Revenue \nService with respect to feedback systems, and you can't be a \nmanager, and you can't hold people accountable unless you have \nfeedback systems. I know that you will direct your attention to \nthose as well.\n    The Chairman. Let me get back, if we might for just a few \nminutes to some specifics. Yesterday, or a couple of days ago, \nwe heard from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, \nTRAC, about the inaccuracy of the figures.\n     In a way, it goes to a question that you have raised, \nSenator Conrad. Really no one knows how widespread some of \nthese practices are. So it is very difficult to evaluate each \nof these problems, how widespread they are.\n     I was shocked by TRAC, which, of course, is associated \nwith Syracuse University, saying that the CID statistical \nfigures--or rather, the IRS reporting of statistical figures, \nsuch as indictments, prosecutions, convictions, were not \naccurate. They accused the IRS of hyping those numbers.\n     This is a very serious charge because it makes it very \ndifficult, as you well know, for us to have effective \noversight, if we cannot trust the figures coming from there. Do \nyou have any suggestions?\n     I would certainly hope that this would be a matter that \nJudge Webster would look into, because I think it is critically \nimportant.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Well, actually, I think that we can \neven move faster than that. I happen to h ave met with Mr. \nBurnham and Ms. Long, who are the people who are the sponsors \nof TRAC, a couple of weeks ago and found out that they have \nbeen studying the IRS for a long period of time.\n     We didn't try to sort out precisely what the difference \nwas in these numbers, but I think I understood why there was \nthis issue. I view this as something that is totally \nunnecessary for us to have, this difference in numbers between \nthe Justice Department and between the TRAC figures.\n     And one of the things that I committed to do is to work \nwith them to try to come up with a more transparent set of \nnumbers, which may not be totally reconciled with the Justice \nDepartment, because there are some differences in the \ndefinitions of what is accounted, but I think that the idea--it \nis similar to what I said on the audits, although we do publish \nstatistics.\n     They are just not clear. They are just not transparent, \nand there really has not been, in my view, a sufficient effort \nto work with groups like TRAC to make them more transparent.\n     So, I think we can do that. That is a relatively easy one, \nas a matter of fact. It may take a little bit of time to do it, \nbut we will do it.\n    The Chairman. Now, some of our witnesses, as well as \nmembers of Congress, have advocated legislation which would \nprovide a private right of action against IRS employees for \nmisconduct. I would appreciate your point of view.\n     Should IRS employees be held personally liable for damages \ncaused by their conduct?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. As I understand it, there are some \nlimited circumstances. And again, this is an area I am just \nlearning about. But, as I understand it, there are some limited \ncircumstances in which individual employees can be sued, and \nthen it is up to the Justice Department to determine whether \nthey would be defended by the government or not.\n     But I really think that that, on the whole, is not the way \nto go to answer these problems. I think that the answer is that \nthe agency should take responsibility, should be accountable \nand should have better processes in place to hold employees and \nmanagers accountable.\n     We have to be concerned also about how we actually attract \nand retain employees. I mean, if we make it too onerous, then \nwe have, again, one of these unintended consequences where the \nbest people will not come.\n     So, I think that the more general answer to that, in my \nview, is to simply make the agency better managed to hold \npeople accountable and certainly taxpayers have recourse, and \nmore so in your bill, against the agency. But if there are \nproblems with individual employees, we should, for the most \npart, be dealing with them ourselves in the agency.\n    The Chairman. Well, some have raised the specter that if \nyou have personal liability on the part of the employees, they \nwill not actively support enforcement. An easy way to protect \ntheir own interest is to do nothing.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Well, that risk does exist with a \nlot of the things that happened here. Senator Chafee really \nmade some excellent points there.\n     We have to come up with a new way of managing it, new ways \nof measuring it and new ways of doing it. It is not simply a \nmatter of saying we have to get rid of all these things, \notherwise, we will not have an agency at all.\n     We have a really creative building job here, not just a \ntearing down job, and that is why it takes a while.\n    The Chairman. Let me turn to anther practice that came out \nof these hearings that deeply disturbed me. Some of our \nwitnesses indicated that the IRS forced taxpayers to sign \nwaivers that they would not sue the IRS or an IRS employee.\n     Are you aware of this practice? Are there any written IRS \npolicies or procedures which relate to the process of seeking \nwaivers?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. I honestly do not know the answer \nto that. I have to get back to you on that one, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Do you have any judgment on the practice \nitself? Should such waivers be permitted?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. I think that is a very good \nquestion to look into. That certainly sounds like that is a \npractice that ought to be reviewed if it does exist, but I do \nnot have that information to really answer that question.\n    The Chairman. A number of witnesses did raise that.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. We will get back to you with some \nviews on that, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Let me make one comment. Earlier I talked \nabout the problems of CID investigating and using intrusive \nmeasures, and I said that was partly because Congress broadened \nthe jurisdiction of the IRS to money laundering and drug \nrunning and so forth.\n     In saying that, I would hope you would investigate and \ngive us your recommendation, or have your task forces do that, \nas to whether there should be some legislative correction in \nthis area.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. I will.\n    The Chairman. I do not want you just to say, well, it is \nrequired of us.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. That is an excellent suggestion, \nMr. Chairman. We had not thought of that, but we will put that \ndown and do it.\n     The Chairman. Senator Moynihan."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Yes. Two things. One must have a little \ncheer here. This legislation that we will be bringing up Monday \ndoes do something that we have heard about, which is the \ndisparity between what you can earn in civil service and what \nthe lawyers and accountants we are up against are earning, and \nwe create 40 individuals who you can pay up to the level of the \nVice President's salary, which is $175,400. You can't pay \nyourself that.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. That is all right."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    I think, frankly, sir, the Commissioner \nought to be at grade two in the civil service industry.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. That is not important."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    I know, but the next person might care. \nYou are going to have the opportunity to bring some people in \nat a pay scale that is the highest in the government.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Senator, I sure hope that \nlegislation passes because I am already recruiting people based \non what is in that bill."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    One question which you do not have to \nanswer, but you might want to think about and give us a note \nabout some time, is it is very clear that the practice of the \nconfidentiality of tax returns, which is meant to be a \nprotection for the individual becomes a complication in which \nnobody can find out what is going on or those who know cannot \nsay.\n     And when you cannot say, you frequently find out you do \nnot bother to know; to learn. Is there some adjustment of \nconfidentiality that would make for a greater transparency in \nwhat happens in the agency while it is protecting the \nindividual?\n    The Chairman. Could I make a comment on that?"
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Would you make a comment. Yes. You are \nChairman.\n    The Chairman. Senator Moynihan raises, I think, a very, \nvery significant factor. The secrecy provisions were developed, \nof course, to protect the taxpayer. None of us have any \ndisagreement with that. It is important.\n     But the fact is that the right of privacy has been used as \nshield to protect the agency from real meaningful oversight.\n     I can tell you we have been criticized because we only \nhave a few cases, but, Senator Moynihan, to try to investigate \nthose few cases is such a tedious, detailed, impossible task \nbecause of privacy, that it has been very difficult to have \neffective oversight. So you have hit right on the head one of \nthe key problems.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Far be it for me to say I have a \nsolution to this problem. I certainly acknowledge it. From my \npersonal point of view, since I personally believe that one of \nthe most basic principles to improve any organization is \ngetting information out, I am interested in making as much \ninformation public as I can.\n     Take this matter of the TRAC. I mean, t here isn't any \nreason why we should have these differences. When I got into \nit, and I met with Ms. Long and Mr. Burnham, one of the \nproblems is that in order to reconcile their data and the \nJustice Department data and our data, you have to get down and \nidentify, at least to some degree--you do not have to have all \nthe data, but you have to have some degree on the individual \ncases.\n     Well, right there, we are blocked from being able to do \nthis. So we are going to try to figure out a way around it. It \nis an impediment to having open communication. Unfortunately, I \nam not sure how to reconcile that. I really have, frankly, not \neven had time to study that problem, and I certainly do not \nhave any suggestions today."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    But, sir, may we hope that you will, and \nwhen you have some thoughts, you will share them with us?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Sure."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Let me just make an observation. Someone \ncommented earlier, rightfully, that the legislation that we are \ngoing to take up this coming week is not the total answer. I \ncould not agree more.\n     But we have got to start somewhere. The thing I want to \nemphasize and have the public understand, because I think it is \nimportant, Senator Moynihan, is that we are going to work \ntogether. The executive branch, the commissioner, this \ncommittee are going to be a team in trying to get the job done, \nbecause that is the only way we will get permanent changes.\n     Let me tell you that we have evidence and information \nabout what's being said in some parts of the IRS organization \nsuch as--well, we will just outlast the Commissioner. Or, we is \nonly going to be here a couple of years and, you know, the \nFinance Committee, they will turn to something else tomorrow.\n     That is not going to happen. We are going to work \ntogether, and we are going to work together over the long term \nbecause that is the only way you are going to correct the \nsituation. One piece of legislation is not going to be the \nultimate answer. We are going to have to continue to look at \nthese problems.\n     It is not a partisan matter. These problems go back to \nother administrations.\n     What we are trying to correct is to make sure that this \nagency, when you and I leave, is the kind of organization that \nthe public trusts and the employees are proud of."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Well said, sir.\n    The Chairman. Senator Gramm.\n    Senator Gramm. Mr. Chairman, let me say that I want to \nidentify myself with both the things that you said and Pat \nsaid. I do think we are going to pass the bill, and so anything \nwe know now that should be done, I think we ought to try to get \nit in this bill.\n     I think it is clear that the confidentiality provisions \nare used to protect the agency, and I am not sure that some of \nit wasn't designed for that purpose. And I think, if we can \nfind a way to fix it, we should.\n     Let me also say, Pat, I strongly agree with you. We do not \never want to make it where public service is something that \nonly rich people can do. I would be interested in working with \nyou in looking at this salary structure. I think there are some \npeople who are willing to do these jobs virtually for nothing, \nbut they ought not have to.\n     I have three questions. First of all, Mr. Rossotti, over \nand over again in listening to people in these cases where they \nwere arguing that the IRS had been abusive--and, boy, the \nevidence seemed overwhelming to me--they made the point that in \norder to get the IRS to stop ruining their lives, they had to, \namong other things, sign an agreement that they would not sue \nthe IRS.\n     I am looking, very strongly, at offering an amendment to \nour bill banning those agreements. Can you tell me why I should \nnot?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Well, I think we would have to look \nat the details of that. I think that is probably an area where \nsome improvement can be made. I honestly cannot provide, \nprecisely, the answer to that question.\n    Senator Gramm. Well, if you would, and I am not trying to \npressure you today.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Yes.\n    Senator Gramm. But look at it over the weekend, because it \nis my plan now to offer this amendment.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. We will.\n    Senator Gramm. If the IRS comes into your place of business \nand is shutting you down and you are going to go broke, and \nthey figure out, somewhere along the way, they made a mistake, \nand one of the ways you can get them to stop is to give up your \nrights to sue them, who would have a choice except to sign \nthat? I think we ought to ban it.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. From a personal standpoint, not \nhaving completely staffed this out everywhere throughout the \ngovernment, I agree that there is something that should be \nlooked at there, and I will get back to you.\n    Senator Gramm. All right. We will try to be sure we are \neasy to reach. We will contact you.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Yes, sir.\n    Senator Gramm. One of the things that worries me--I do not \ndoubt your sincerity at all, and I am not saying this is an \neasy thing to solve. But it has to do with the difficulty of \nfiring people.\n     I guessed, from what you had said or did not say in \nresponse to Connie Mack, that there is no evidence of anybody \nthat has been fired as a result of any hearing we have had. Is \nthat right?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Let me just give you a statistic \nthat I found out in preparing for these hearings. In terms of \nactually firing people, in the entire history of the senior \nexecutive services, about 7,000 senior executives in the entire \nFederal Government--and it was created in its current form in \n1979. So that is 19 years.\n     My statistics, I think are right. I have got it in here. \nThere have been 16 people fired, actually fired for misconduct.\n     Now, does that mean there were only 16 people that were \nremoved or in other ways gotten out? I do not think so, because \nI think, as in most organizations, in reality, in practical \nterms, most of the time, when there is somebody--unless they \nhave really serious criminal misconduct, what happens is that \nthey retire or they are moved out, and you just get them out of \nthe way one way or another.\n     So, when you really get down to the point of how many \npeople are fired, if there were only 16 in the entire Federal \nGovernment in 19 years, it is pretty obvious that firing, in \nthe narrow sense of the term, is not the main thing that \nhappens.\n     I think that the most important thing is can we move aside \npeople that are not performing or not performing correctly, and \ncan we bring in people that we need, which is actually the \nsecond part. It is the harder part.\n     My conclusion is that it is very slow, but it can be done. \nAnd if you are determined to do it and you really make a \ndistinct effort, you can do it. Some of the provisions in your \nbill will actually make it a whole lot easier.\n    Senator Gramm. Well, any suggestions you have as to what we \ncould do to make it easier for you to fire people who are \nabusive and who violate the procedures, would be very \nimportant.\n     I would like your staff to get for me, if they could, what \nkind of penalty would be imposed, as a normal course of \nfunctioning, for an IRS agent who threatened a police officer \nwho stopped him for a speeding ticket; that he would be audited \nif he wrote you the ticket?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. We can get you that. I do not have \nit with me, but there actually is a guide.\n    Senator Gramm. My view is that ought to be a firing \noffense. If that is proven, that is exactly the kind of thing--\nI mean, it seems like a little thing, but it is a statement of \na mentality that is bread by this closed system.\n     And I think that at IRS, from the point of view of \nretribution, he who threatens to use an audit, that that single \noffense ought to get somebody fired.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Well, I can get you information.\n    Senator Gramm. If you will get me what the penalty is so I \ncan look at it.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Yes. We will get it for you.\n    Senator Gramm. It probably ought to be a firing offense, \nand I know that sounds pretty strong and maybe there are \nextenuating circumstances----\n    The Chairman. No. It does not sound strong. It sounds \nperfectly right.\n    Senator Gramm. Well, I appreciate that. I think it is a \nreal problem.\n     Let me just say, in conclusion--and I want to thank you, \nMr. Chairman for giving me the second round--I know that you \nhave got to be torn between trying to run an agency that has \ngot to collect money.\n     And the one thing that I tried to say throughout these \nwhole hearings is that I want to tough on tax cheats. It always \nmake me nervous when we get in this business of rich people and \npoor people.\n     I have got no sympathy for people that cheat on their \ntaxes, whether they are rich or poor and whether they cheat 10 \ncents or $10 million. They are both criminals, and they ought \nto be vigorously prosecuted, and we ought to go after them, \nunmercifully, within the law and within a system of checks and \nbalances.\n     But I know you have got to be torn between trying to \ncollect this money, which we are spending pretty fast here, and \nwanting to do something about the problem.\n     I would just like to say, in conclusion, as an outsider \nand in terms of morale of the IRS, I think firing about 50 of \nthese people who are clearly abusing the system would be a good \nthing, if I worked for the IRS. Fifty 50 people who were \nclearly bad actors and who had brought disgrace on a profession \nthat I cared enough to dedicate my life to. I would feel good \nabout it.\n     In trying to measure the terribly difficult job that you \nhave of maintaining the morale of an agency that is being beat \nup on television every day, and you have got to go and tell \nyour children, well, yeah, I work there, but I am not like \nthose guys and that is not the way real people are there, I \nthink that going through these cases and identifying these bad \npeople and firing a whole bunch of them would be well received \nby your employees.\n     I think they would appreciate it, and I think the American \npeople would. So, I am not saying let's have a hanging just for \ndisplay purposes, but I think----\n    The Chairman. You are from Texas, aren't you?\n    Senator Gramm. I think where hangings are due, after a fair \ntrial, that they are justified. And I would think, if I were \nworking at the IRS and all these accusations had been made, and \nif some of them checked out to be true, I would feel better if \nthose people were fired.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. All I can say is what I said in the \ntestimony, is that although it is a laborious process, we are \ngoing to investigate every one of these allegations, as well as \nothers, by the way, that I have initiated. And the Chairman's \nsuggestion of having GAO help us with this is an outstanding \nsuggestion.\n     And when we get the results of this, through some process \nthat we have, we will take action, and we will take the \nstrongest that we can, recognizing there are all these \nguidelines and there are rules as to what we can do.\n    The Chairman. Senator Conrad."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n     You have got 110,000 employees. It is one of the largest \nenterprises in the world. Do you have any sense of--now, we \nhave had a number of cases presented over this week in our \nprevious hearings.\n     In any large enterprise, private sector, public sector, we \nwould anticipate a certain number of cases like this. Certainly \nyou would find people within the agency or within the \nenterprise that feel aggrieved, feel they have been mistreated, \nfeel they have been harassed, feel they have not been promoted \nwhen they should have been. That is true in any large \nenterprise.\n     Do you have any sense, based on your private sector \nexperience, if given the scale of this enterprise, if the \nRevenue Service is different in terms of employees operating \ninappropriately?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. That is really a hard question to \nanswer in any kind of statistical sense. I mean, for one thing, \nI do not have a way of answering, honestly, that question.\n     I think that what we do about it though is probably not \ntotally influenced too much by that. What my view is, using my \nairplane analogy, even if we have a few crashes, that is too \nmany. We may recognize that statistically we will--using the \nairplane analogy again--some day have another air crash. But \nthat doesn't mean we ever want to forecast it or anticipate it \nor accept it.\n     We want to try to do everything we can to prevent it. So, \nI think that that is the answer.\n     With respect though to the employees, I really want to \nmake a comment about that, because I have had the time. I have \nprobably talked to at least 1,000 of the IRS employees, either \nin large groups or small groups.\n     They are, as the Chairman and others have said, for the \nvast majority of them, very dedicated employees, and they are \nvery, very worried about where the IRS is. And that is one of \nmy tasks, to reassure them.\n     I think that in addition to the specific problems that we \nhave heard here, you do have some normal stresses like other \norganizations have had. I mean, the IRS has been downsized. We \nhave 10,000 fewer employees than we had 3 years ago.\n     That creates stresses. There are not as many promotions, \nthere are not as many replacements. There has been a \nconsolidation of overhead in districts.\n     As you know, in some of the districts it was very \nunpleasant and people had to lose their jobs or be reassigned \nto other places. We have had the public pressure, and the \nemployees do really care about this.\n     In addition to that, we are also going through, as in any \nlarge organization in America, the stresses that are part of \nthe changes in society. We have different kinds of \nrelationships than perhaps were traditional 10, 15 years ago \nbetween women and women; between people of different races.\n     These create certain kinds of stresses in the IRS, as they \ndo in other places. You add to that the more specific things, \nthe more specific kinds of problems that have been identified \nhere, and you do have an organization that I would say is \nhighly stressed. And those come out in a number of different \nways.\n     Our challenge, and what I am hoping to do is, is to set \nthis forth in a positive way to say, look, we can turn this \naround. We can build a new IRS.\n     And if you look at my testimony, one of the three goals, \nwhich I absolutely believe is critical to making this work, is \ncreating a work environment, a quality work environment, that \nprovides the right kind of environment for the employees to be \nsuccessful, because we won't provide good service to taxpayers \nunless we have a working environment that provides satisfaction \nfor the employees.\n     This is part of the challenge of moving this whole \norganization ahead, and it is a very difficult time, but I \nbelieve, with the help of the Congress, it can be done."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Can I just go into one other matter, Mr. \nChairman, that I think is important? Briefly.\n    The Chairman. Briefly. Yes."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    This is a delicate area, but I think it is \nvery important, and that is the use of statistical measures to \ndetermine what individuals and working entities within the \nRevenue Service due in terms of performance.\n     It is totally inappropriate, in my judgment, to have \nquotas. When I ran a tax agency, we never had quotas. Ever. I \nnever thought they were appropriate. But I must say there have \nbeen some developments in some things I have heard that strike \nme as throwing the baby out with the bath water.\n     I mean, there is no way that I know to run any enterprise \nwithout the statistical measures on what people are doing in \nterms of performance. And if you are in collections, one \nmeasure of performance is how much you collect.\n     Now, another measure ought to be that you do not abuse \npeople and you do not cross the line in terms of the treatment \nof taxpayers. If you are in audit, there are statistical \nmeasures that are simply critical to evaluating whether a unit \nis performing or failing to perform; is using their resources \neffectively.\n     Can you tell me how you approach this question of the use \nof statistical measures in evaluating performance? What is your \nintention on that?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Well, you are quite right, this is \none of the most difficult areas that we are addressing and is \none in which it is very unsettled right now.\n     We are stopping doing things that were inappropriate, such \nas giving people, if not quotas, at least things that could be \nvery closely interpreted as quotas, in the sense that you would \nhave a very concrete goal of so much money per person down at \nthe individual level or even the first line manager level, \nwhich is what was prohibited by the taxpayer bill of rights.\n     So, we have stopped that. As I say, maybe there are a few \npeople who didn't get the word, but that has stopped. The \nproblem is we have somewhat of a vacuum right now because we \nhave not developed the more appropriate kinds of measures, \nwhich are more balanced between the kind of thing that you were \ntalking about--case quality; treatment of taxpayers; how the \nemployee sees it.\n     We know that we have to do that, but when you look at it \nin terms of the complexity of the IRS for all the different \nfunctions, examinations of all the different kinds of \ntaxpayers, the geographical regions, this is not something that \nwe do overnight.\n     So where we are today is that for this fiscal year we have \na very unclear situation--I am being very honest about this--by \npeople around the agency as to what they are supposed to do and \nwhat they are not supposed to do, and we are going to try, even \nin the next few months, to at least do some clarification of \nthat because it leaves a vacuum.\n     More basically, we have a task force working with, again, \nanother outside set of experts that are working on developing \non interim set of measures for fiscal 1999 that will attempt to \ndo those kinds of balancing, and even that will be far from \nperfect.\n     I believe it is going to take two to 3 years to actually \ndevelop the right kind of measures for all the different \nfunctions, and even then it will not be perfect because we have \ngot to do some even more basic things that relate to how the \norganization is structured and how we measure compliance and \nother things before we really get to where we want to go.\n     So, I sound like a broken record, but we have got some \nshort term things that we are doing. We do have a problem in \nthis area. I really have to be honest with the committee.\n     There is a certain amount of confusion. While we have \ngotten rid of things that have been ingrained for 25 years, we \nhaven't put the new things in place. That is where we are right \nnow."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    If I could just say, I think this is one of \nthe most important things to do. You cannot manage an \nenterprise of this scale without statistical measures, and I \nwould just urge you, as one idea, to go to some of the states \nto see what they are doing.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. We will."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Whether it is California or Massachusetts; \nthat are well run, large enterprises and see how they are doing \nit.\n     I thank the Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Well, I think we all agree that it is \nimportant that you develop new performance standards. I do have \nto say it does concern me when you have individuals, under \noath, coming forward and saying, for example, even now in the \nsoutheast area I believe it was, there were statistics being \ndeveloped and people were being graded by how many seizures \nthey made. If they didn't have enough, it was negative.\n     Commissioner Rossotti. That shouldn't be. I was going to \ntrack that one down. I heard that testimony, and I am going to \ntrack it down. I mean, I think that we are getting close to \nstamping those kinds of things out, but it may be that there \nare some people who just didn't get it. But we will get rid of \nthose.\n    The Chairman. I have a couple of quick questions I would \nlike to ask.\n     Yesterday, we heard from IRS employees who testified that \nin certain cases potential tax liability has been zeroed out \nfor reasons unrelated to their merits. Have you previously \nheard of this problem? Do you have a plan to address this \nproblem?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. In terms of that specific \nallegation, I think that is the one that should be checked out, \nif it was improper. I have not heard of that specific problem. \nI think that that gets to the question of, again, basic \nmanagement.\n     I mean, the purpose of a manager in managing an audit \nactivity is to know what is going on and be accountable and \nthere is, of course, data that tracks what those settlements \nare that is available to people up the line.\n     I have not heard of that as a widespread problem or a \nparticular problem, but we will look into that particular \nallegation. Not only follow up on that particular one, but see \nif there is something we can learn from it.\n    The Chairman. Let me ask you this: As you know, we have \nheard a lot of serious allegations. You are familiar with the \nlegislation that we are taking up next.\n     Do you have any further recommendations or suggestions at \nthis time as to how that legislation can be improved?\n     Commissioner Rossotti. Well, the only specific one I have \nat this time is just the one that we have already sent you in \nthe letter, which is just a practical issue of the effective \ndates on some of the provisions so we can get the computer \nsystems in.\n     There are a few minor tune ups, I would call them, on some \nof the personnel flexibilities that I would like to work with \nyour staff on, basically so we can get the new people in.\n     And then, of course, there are some issues that the staff \nis working on and some of the taxpayer rights issues that the \nTreasury is taking the lead on that I know we are working with \nyou on. But my main statement on the legislation is that I \nthink it is going to help a lot in terms of improving the IRS, \nand I really hope we can get it passed.\n    The Chairman. I wish to announce that the record will \nremain open until 5:00 today for members who wish to pose \nwritten questions to the Commissioner. Members should send \ntheir questions to the chief clerk.\n     We thank you for being here----"
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Mr. Chairman?\n    The Chairman. Yes, sir."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Before we close, not to spoil things, but \ncould I offer a positive note?\n    The Chairman. Absolutely."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    You put together a wonderful week of \nhearings, the second round. We have heard some horror stories, \nwe have heard some great many charges, but no one has ever come \nto us to say that the Internal Revenue Service was used for \npolitical purposes by the administrations of any president in \nthe past 20 years.\n     The charges, the efforts to frame Senator Baker, Mr. \nQuillen, were just wholly specific to that particular office \nand this deranged agent.\n     But whatever else it is, this could not be more important. \nIt is clear that the Internal Revenue Service has kept itself \nout of American politics completely, and that is a badge of \nhonor that we should not hesitate to display.\n    The Chairman. There is actually a study going on concerning \nthat matter. As far as I know, what you say is absolutely \ncorrect. And, of course, that is one of the reasons, I think, \nwe are in the situation where an administration can only \nappoint one or, at most, two employees. The Commissioner and \nthe counsel is the other one. And frankly, I think that is a \nproblem."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Not enough political input.\n    The Chairman. There is not enough oversight."
"moynihan","Senator Moynihan","moynihan","Senator Moynihan","    Yes.\n     The Chairman. It is impossible for one commissioner and \none chief counsel to adequately overview, and that is the \nreason I think it is important that he be given the opportunity \nto have his team there; that he can appoint people. Frankly, \nmuch of the problem is restructuring, legislation, the code. \nThe code is too broad. It leaves too much discretionary power \nin the agency.\n     But it is also the question of culture and management, and \nthat is the reason we are lucky in having an individual with \nthis background.\n     Commissioner Rossotti, I want to thank you for being here. \nThank you for taking on this heavy responsibility. I cannot say \nhow important I think it is that everybody work together in \ntrying to bring the solution. We can and will do the job with \nyour assistance.\n     Commissioner Rossotti.

"","","baucus","Hon. Max Baucus","    Mr. Chairman: One of the earliest controversies facing the newly \nindependent United States of America involved the taxing powers of the \nfederal government. After all, unjust taxes were among the chief causes \nof the War for Independence.\n    But our founding fathers had fresh memories of raising an army and \nrunning an embattled government mostly on borrowed funds. They knew \nthey would need revenue to provide for the common good. So, in an act \npassed by the very first Congress, we gave the central government the \npower to collect tariffs and taxes, so long as they were fair and \nuniform.\n    During the last couple of months, in every household across the \ncountry, Americans went through an annual rite. They sat down at the \nkitchen table, pulled all their financial records together, and figured \nout what they owed the government.\n    Nobody likes doing their taxes. And they probably dislike paying \nthem even more. Yet the vast majority do it. And they do it honestly. \nAmericans realize they have a bargain with their country, which it is \ntheir duty to uphold.\n    They pay their taxes so that their money, when pooled together with \nthe money contributed by all their friends, neighbors and fellow \ncitizens, is used wisely ``for the common good.''\n    Americans expect their money to defend their families from hostile \nnations. To educate their children. To provide for a clean and \nhealthful environment. To improve their highways. To help keep them \nhealthy. To help provide for them in their old age. And to give a \nhelping hand to those going through hard times.\n    In short, Americans expect their money to be used to pay for all of \nthe things that help make this nation great. In return, though, the \nAmerican people want their government to do two things.\n    First, the American people want their government to treat them with \nrespect and dignity as the revenue is collected. They expect to have \ntheir privacy respected, and to be treated fairly.\n    Second, Americans expect that everyone else who enjoys the benefits \ntaxes pay for will shoulder their share of the burden. That their \nneighbor down the street isn't hiding part of his income, and thus \navoiding paying his fair share of the tax. That everyone is filing \nreturns, and that the amounts claimed on those returns are accurate and \ntrue.\n    Mr. Chairman, I truly believe the American people have the right to \nhave both of these expectations met. And I believe we here in the \nSenate shoulder a great deal of the responsibility for making sure of \nit.\n    We were placed on this Committee because, presumably. we understand \nthe need for revenue to keep this country running. We also understand \nthe grave responsibility that goes along with the power to tax.\n    John Marshall said: ``The power to tax involves the power to \ndestroy.'' It is our duty as members of this committee to make sure \nthis country does not use its power in that fashion.\n    How do we do that? We must stay above partisan politics and petty \nsquabbles. We must make sure our laws reflect good public policy--that \nthe tax code is used for the benefit of the American people.\n    That is why I have watched the process we have gone through in \nanticipation of these hearings with a measure of personal regret and \ndisappointment. I do not believe these hearings are balanced. I believe \nthey fail to rise above partisan politics. And I do not believe they \nwill ultimately benefit the American people.\n    Mr. Chairman, if you look in Webster's New World Dictionary, under \nthe word ``oversight,'' you will find it described as ``vigilant \nsupervision.'' As Members of the Senate Finance Committee, we must be \nvigilant that individual taxpayers are being treated right by the \nInternal Revenue Service. However, it is every bit as important that we \nare vigilant to make sure taxpayers are treated fairly.\n    Let me make it clear: I do not object to investigating the IRS to \nmake sure it is operating correctly and treating taxpayers right. That \nis part of our responsibility. But I also believe we have a \nresponsibility to look at the whole picture, not just place a spotlight \non the issues that give political advantage to one party or another.\n    How can we spend four days talking about a handful of cases that \nthe IRS might or might not have mishandled, yet not spend a single \nminute talking about how some Americans are flouting the tax laws? Our \nentire system of collecting revenue would unravel if taxpayers stopped \npaying their fair share because they believed everyone else is \ncheating.\n    Estimates of tax avoidance are soaring, with many believing the \nnumbers could reach $100 BILLION per year. How can we ignore this \nissue, or ignore the dangers that IRS employees face every day as they \ntry to do the job we have hired them to do?\n    Mr. Chairman, we have a new Commissioner of the IRS, Charles \nRossotti. He is an honorable man, and a good public servant. We have \ngiven him a mighty challenge--to reform an agency that has resisted \nreform in the past.\n    He has asked us for a few simple tools to make the IRS work better. \nChanges in personnel rules, so he can put a good working team in place. \nThe ability to reorganize the agency, so he can eliminate layers of \nduplication. Most of these provisions are included in the IRS \nrestructuring bill that the House passed six months ago by a vote of \n426-4. That bill still awaits action by the full Senate.\n    Mr. Chairman, if we are going to spend our time on these hearings, \nI wish they could be balanced. But since that apparently is not \npossible, I urge you to move quickly to pass a good IRS restructuring \nbill through the Senate.\n    Passing a solid restructuring bill will do more to get the IRS on \ntrack than a hundred of these hearings where we sit, posture, \npontificate and play politics.\n    It is our responsibility as Members of this Committee. And, more \nimportantly, it is our responsibility to the American people.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."

"","","conrad","Hon. Kent Conrad","     Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The series of hearings we begin today \nwill be useful if they help us find ways to help the IRS become more \nresponsive to the needs of taxpayers--a task the committee has been \npursuing for many months.\n     We know the IRS has had management problems. Commissioner Rossotti \nis bringing a professional manager's approach to the agency, and we \nlook forward to hearing from him later this week to find out what he \nhas been able to do in solving the problems that this committee's \nhearings have uncovered.\n     If we are going to be serious about helping taxpayers, the best \nthing the Senate could do would be to pass the IRS reform bill that \nthis committee approved unanimously almost a month ago. Personally, I \nam disappointed that we have delayed getting this bill to the floor.\n     Finance Committee bill would provide more protection for innocent \nspouses pursued by the IRS for tax liabilities they never knew about. \nIt would provide significant relief in the tax penalty area. It would \nalso give the Commissioner the tools he needs to deal quickly with IRS \nemployees who engage in abusive and coercive behavior.\n     When IRS employees cross the line, the Commissioner needs to put a \nstop to it. Abusive behavior should not and cannot be tolerated. When \nIRS personnel violate the agency's rules and standards of conduct, \nswift punishment and correction must follow.\n     We have an important national interest in an IRS that is \nefficient, well managed and fair to citizens who must deal with it. \nWhen it fails to respect the taxpayers--who, after all, are paying for \nthe agency--it breeds disrespect for the system.\n     I expect to see this committee insisting on more accountability \nwhen it comes to overseeing the IRS. Government agents who deal with \ncitizens as directly as IRS agents do must be held to the highest \npossible standards.\n     It is a shame that taxpayers have gone through yet another filing \nseason without the benefit of those additional protections our bill \nwould provide. We worked with Commissioner Rossotti in shaping that \nbill to respond to what he--as well as taxpayers themselves--have been \ntelling us face-to-face about how the agency could be improved. \nEnacting that bill ought to be our top priority."

"","","conrad","Hon. Kent Conrad","    I am David Crockett, named after a distant relative of mine who \nonce served in Congress. I have served as District Attorney General for \nthe First District of Tennessee for the past 16 years. I am presently \nengaged in a campaign seeking election to my third eight year term in \nthat office. I previously served 10 years as an Assistant District \nAttorney. I am a graduate of East Tennessee State University and the \nUniversity of Tennessee College of Law. I served 4 years as a Captain \nin the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the United States Army during \nthe Vietnam Conflict, concluding my service as Chief of the Military \nJustice Division at Ft. Jackson, South Carolina.\n    I, like Senator Baker and Congressman Quillen, was a target of an \nIRS agent who was assigned to East Tennessee in the mid 1980's. I first \nbecame aware of this agent when his car hit another automobile on N. \nRoan Street in Johnson City, Tennessee, after he left a local bar. The \nagent was charged with DUI. He refused a breathalyzer test and \nsuccessfully defended the charge aided by the testimony of several \nother federal agents and employees who swore that he was not under the \ninfluence of an intoxicant.\n    Since a member of my staff prosecuted him, thin agent apparently \nincluded me in a plan he formulated for revenge and career advancement. \nHe, shortly after his acquittal, began proclaiming publicly in bars and \nrestaurants that he was going to get Senator Baker, Congressman Quillen \nand me. He said that we were ``crooks and tax cheats.'' Frankly, I was \na bit flattered to be included in such distinguished company as Senator \nBaker and Congressman Quillen. However, the repeated accusations by \nthis agent, frequently when he was drinking in bars, eventually led to \nan investigation of me that continued for several years, first by the \nIRS and later by some of his friends with other federal agencies. No \ncharges were ever placed nor was any action ever taken, in fact, the \ninvestigation simply died without me ever being formally advised that \nit had ever existed. Yet even today, the damage done by this agent \nstill lingers, particularly around election time. Reputations are \ndelicate things which once lost are difficult to regain.\n    I know now that these courageous agents and employees of the IRS \nwho are here today and who previously testified did intervene and some \nsacrificed their careers to stop this rogue agent. To them today, I \nwant to publicly and formally express my deepest appreciation and \ngratitude for what they did.\n    As for this IRS agent, well his drinking seemed to get worse, yet \nhe continued in his job until one night in Knoxville when he and a \nrelative were caught with a quantity of cocaine in their vehicle. The \nagent tried to bluff his way out of trouble by telling the local deputy \nthat he and his relative, (a nephew I believe), were engaged in an \nundercover operation for the IRS The local deputy persisted and \ncontacted the agent's superior, who, of course, knew nothing of such an \n``operation.'' After this episode, the agent's friends could no longer \nprotect him and he was subsequently fired from his position. Somehow, \nhe avoided prosecution for cocaine possession in Knoxville, which is \nnot within my district. This agent's ambition to get some ``big \npeople'' to advance his own career was wrong and the failure of those \nin management who protected him was disgraceful, particularly when \nmanagement turned their animosity upon the few agents of integrity who \ntried to bring this agent to their attention. These agents of honor are \nthe true heroes of this story.\n    If anything can be learned from this episode it is that we average \nAmericans, who work every day and pay our taxes, still fear the IRS \nwhose agents can, by virtue of their positions, destroy lives and ruin \ncareers. If our story can help prevent others from being targeted \nunjustly, and insure better supervision of IRS field agents, then our \ntime here today will have been well spent."

"","","d'amato","Hon. Alfonse D'Amato","    Mr. Chairman, I commend you for your leadership in holding \nadditional oversight hearings on the practices and procedures of the \nIRS. Our past hearings exposed major problems within the agency, \nincluding abuses of power and egregious mistreatment of taxpayers. And, \nalthough the IRS reform legislation, passed unanimously by this \nCommittee, goes a long way to bring about the change needed to restore \ntaxpayer confidence in our system, in the final analysis, what is truly \nneeded is continued Congressional oversight of the IRS.\n    Besides continued oversight, we must ensure that IRS officials who \nencourage or mandate taxpayer mistreatment are held accountable and \nremoved from their positions of authority. The stories relayed in \nyesterday's hearing were as shocking as those heard in past hearings. \nTargeting a taxpayer's representative for audit or other investigation \nbecause he vigorously defends his client, and blatantly ignoring policy \nthat requires contact with a taxpayer's representative is conduct \nbeyond comprehension. But, to intentionally put a very ill taxpayer in \nharms way, is totally reprehensible. Until the agency and its \nresponsible employees are held accountable for these egregious acts, \nthis Committee's oversight role must not end.\n    I applaud Commissioner Rossotti's efforts to improve the IRS. His \nrecent announcement to appoint Judge William Webster (the former FBI \nDirector) to review the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) is \nfurther evidence of his commitment to effect fundamental change at the \nIRS. I trust that these efforts will also include a careful look at top \nmanagement officials to ensure that fundamental change to the IRS \nculture is of paramount consideration.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."

"","","d'amato","Hon. Alfonse D'Amato","    Mr. Chairman and members of the committee:\nIdentification and Personal Background\n    My name is Robert Edwin Davis. I am an attorney, and I have \npracticed law in Dallas, Texas for almost 40 years. During most of \nthose years, the greatest part of my practice has been devoted to \nrepresenting taxpayers in civil and criminal tax litigation and \ncontroversies with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the \nDepartment of Justice. During the years 1982 and 1983, however, I \nserved as Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Tax Division of the \nDepartment of Justice in Washington, D.C. I was then responsible for \noverseeing the functions of the Criminal Section and Review Section \n(large civil case settlements) of the Tax Division. I think it would be \nfair to say that there are few attorneys in the United States who have \nhandled more civil and criminal tax cases on behalf of taxpayers than I \nhave since 1960.\nDescription of Issues to be Discussed\n    Tax collecting has always been an unpopular calling. From biblical \ntimes to the present, there have been few--or no--warmly regarded tax \ncollectors. Most of the employees in the IRS are sincere and honorable \npeople, going about their thankless work of administering the rules and \npolicies adopted by Congress, the Treasury Department and senior IRS \nofficials.. However, my personal experience is that all is not well \nwith our tax system, and I believe that (1) the IRS has, to a \nsignificant extent, strayed from its proper path; (2) there is \nexcessive use and misuse of intrusive and even oppressive investigative \ntechniques within the Criminal Investigation Division (IRS CID); and \n(3) there are sometimes serious integrity issues within the agency, but \nthat the IRS Inspection Service (IRS-Inspection) is simply not up to \nthe task of investigating and correcting IRS agent misconduct when it \ndoes occur. I would like to present my views on these subjects to the \nCommittee over the next several minutes, and in a supplemental written \nstatement.\nExcessive Use and Misuse of Intrusive Investigative Techniques by the \n        IRS CID\n    Fifteen years ago, when I was the Criminal Deputy in the Tax \nDivision, criminal tax enforcement practices were almost totally \ndifferent from those which are encountered today.\n  <bullet> ``Undercover'' investigative techniques were almost entirely \n        unknown in criminal tax matters;\n  <bullet> Search warrants were used in criminal tax cases only a dozen \n        times in an entire calendar year;\n  <bullet> Grand jury investigations were a rare exception, and \n        administrative investigations were the rule.\n    Today that is dramatically changed, and the use of these much more \nintimidating and intrusive techniques is commonly encountered. For \nexample, search warrants are executed in criminal tax investigations \ntoday some twenty times as frequently as they were then.\n    It is not surprising that these changes have occurred. As the IRS \nCID has been increasingly used in the suppression of drug and organized \ncriminal activity, its special agents have learned the investigative \ntechniques which are employed by the DEA, the FBI and local law \nenforcement to deal with violent and dangerous criminals. These \ninvestigative strategies are then ``borrowed'' and used by IRS CID in \nroutine criminal tax investigations of taxpayers who are neither \ndangerous nor violent. Many of us believe that this is a very bad tax \nenforcement policy. Today, we see too many ``cowboy'' agents, as they \nare called, who are undisciplined and inadequately controlled, and who \nthink that the end (putting away the ``bad guys'') justifies the means \n(intrusive, intimidating and oppressive investigations). Let me give \nyou an example of the kind of abuses which concern me.\nAn Example: Executing A Search Warrant to Obtain An Appraisal of \n        Residential Furnishings\n    One summer morning in June of 1994, approximately ten IRS special \nagents appeared at a private residence at 7:30 a.m. They knocked on the \ndoor, which roused the only resident of the home from her bath. This \nresident, ``Sally,'' was a 45-year old woman who was living in a home \nwhich had formerly been owned by her grandmother. She put on a bath \nrobe and responded to the knock at the door. There were approximately \nten IRS special agents in her yard and on her porch, one of whom \npresented a warrant to search her house. The agents then entered her \nhouse. She was told she could either leave or stay, but if she left she \nwould not be permitted to return so long as they were at the house. She \nelected to remain, and she was confined to one bedroom, where she \nremained in the presence of a female IRS agent. The remaining agents \nsearched her home for about eight hours, and then left. The only \nproperty which they ``seized'' and took with them when they left were \nsome 86 old family photographs, many of them taken at Christmas \ngatherings. Sally was very upset by this forceful intrusion into her \nhome. She missed an entire day of work, and had no idea why the ten \nagents had entered her house and taken the family photographs.\n    Later, Sally discovered the real reason for the invasive search. It \nwas not to seize contraband, weapons, drugs or evidence of any crime. \nInstead, the agents had brought with them a furniture appraiser who \nwent from room to room valuing the beds, sofas, chairs, tables and \nother personal effects which had been left in the house by her \ngrandmother at the time of her death two and one-half years earlier. \nThe Internal Revenue Service agents believed that Sally's father, the \nexecutor, had undervalued the furniture on her grandmother's estate tax \nreturn. Sally was not a suspect or in any way involved in the estate \ntax issues, and her father did not live in the house with her. The \ncriminal investigation of Sally's father was later abandoned by IRS \nCID.\n    The extravagant loss of agent time in preparing for and executing \nthis ``raid'' on the home of an admittedly innocent party who was not a \nsuspect at all was utterly needless. A simple telephone call to Sally \nwould have resulted in consent for the IRS appraiser to inspect and \nappraise the furniture. Intimidating and intrusive ``searches and \nseizures'' are wholly unnecessary to develop valuation cases involving \nhousehold furnishings. That was, in my opinion, one ``search and \nseizure operation'' which should never have been authorized or \nexecuted.\n    Several years later, after I demanded their return, the IRS \nbelatedly gave back the 86 family photographs.\nIntrusive Investigative Techniques Should Not Be Used in Routine \n        Criminal Tax Investigations.\n    I believe, as do many others, that kicking down doors, wearing body \narmor, carrying automatic weapons and bursting into people's homes with \nlarge raiding parties are techniques which should--if used at all--be \nreserved for investigations of dangerous and violent criminals. IRS CID \nshould do what it was created to do: pursue the enforcement of the \ninternal revenue laws, and it should leave violent and dangerous \ncriminals to the DEA, FBI and local law enforcement authorities. The \nexceptions to this rule should be very limited.\n    I would also like to speak briefly on the subject of undercover \noperations. Some of us also believe that the deceit and \nmisrepresentation which are inherent in undercover investigations and \n``sting'' operations have no proper place in routine criminal tax \ninvestigations. Successful criminal tax prosecutions have long been \nmade in this country without them. The IRS does serious and needless \ndamage to its image and relationship with the public--and government as \na whole--when it lies to and deceives taxpayers in routine criminal tax \ninvestigations.\nOne Final Appeal: Simplify Our Tax Laws\n    There is a pervasive national frustration with our federal income \ntax system, which is far too complex and unintelligible to be fairly \nand uniformly administered by the IRS. Further, our tax laws cannot be \nunderstood or complied with by the great majority of our taxpayers. \nIndeed, it is my observation that even well-trained tax professionals \nfrequently cannot comprehend and work competently with the Internal \nRevenue Code. I would respectfully urge that it is time for a major \nsimplification, or some other fundamental change in our income tax \nlaws."

break,break,break,break
"","","d'amato","Hon. Alfonse D'Amato","    Mr. Chairman and members of the committee: I would like to submit \nfor the consideration of the Committee and its staff some additional \ninformation which it is hoped may be useful in your deliberations \nregarding IRS integrity and conduct issues. In this supplement to my \noral statement, I will briefly describe some actual matters which have \nbeen presented in my practice. They are described in a way which \ndeletes any reference to the names of either individual taxpayers or \nIRS personnel.\nThe IRS Inspection Service (IRS-Inspection) and the Office of Inspector \n        General of the Treasury (OIG-Treasury) Should Not Have \n        Exclusive Authority Over IRS Agent Misconduct Issues\n    My professional experience has taught me to be seriously skeptical \nabout the capacity and resolve of the IRS-Inspection to identify, \ninvestigate and fairly evaluate claims made by taxpayers and their \nrepresentatives regarding IRS agent misconduct and abuse. I will \nacknowledge at the outset that many taxpayer complaints about IRS agent \nmisconduct are unfounded, or at best, are only partly justified. I am \npersonally satisfied, however, that serious agent misconduct has \noccurred and does occur today. I am also fully satisfied that IRS-\nInspection is not the place to repose the exclusive power and \nresponsibility to investigate and resolve these issues.\n    It is my opinion that IRS-Inspection investigators are often too \nclose to the very personnel and offices which they are assigned to \ninvestigate. Further, some IRS-Inspection investigators seem to feel \nthat their own agency suffers a ``black eye'' when agent misconduct is \nidentified or confirmed. As a result, they often cannot and do not view \ntaxpayer reports of agent misconduct with objectivity, and do not \npursue them with appropriate zeal. I believe that is especially true \nregarding allegations of misconduct by IRS CID personnel.\n    Our national experience with police departments across the nation \nconfirms one conclusion: the public does not have confidence that \npolice investigators will objectively investigate allegations of \nmisconduct by their own fellow officers. That public skepticism is \njustified. Similarly, ``letting the IRS investigate its own'' has not \nworked satisfactorily in the past, and it should not be relied upon in \nthe future. I would like to provide the Committee with an example.\nIRS-Inspection Punishes Taxpayer Complainant\n    Several years ago, I represented a taxpayer in a criminal tax case \nwhom I shall call ``Joe Smith.'' Mr. Smith and two of his employees \nprovided me with affidavits asserting serious misconduct on the part of \ntwo IRS special agents, including perjury. Because I was skeptical \nabout these claims, I asked these three witnesses whether they would \nagree to submit to a polygraph examination. Thereafter, Mr. Smith and \nthe two employees individually passed separate polygraph examinations \nadministered by a highly-skilled polygraph operator. I was assured by \nthe polygraph operator that, in his professional opinion, my client and \nhis two employees were telling the truth. The client and I believed \nthat this serious agent misconduct should be presented to the IRS-\nInspection. Because a criminal indictment of Mr. Smith was then \npending, we negotiated a direct and explicit agreement with the IRS-\nInspection: that it would consider the taxpayer's complaint, including \nphotographs, affidavits of Mr. Smith and his staff, as well as the \nresults of three polygraph examinations, but that none of these \nmaterials would be disclosed either to the special agents or the Office \nof the United States Attorney prosecuting the case until after the \ncriminal case was concluded. Not only did the IRS-Inspection accept \nthat information, they also interviewed Mr. Smith and asked for other \ninformation as well. All information the IRS-Inspection requested was \nprovided.\n    Notwithstanding the direct and explicit agreement that the \nmaterials provided by Mr. Smith would remain confidential until after \nthe trial, investigators for the IRS-Inspection very promptly violated \nthat agreement, and delivered over all of these materials they had \nobtained from Mr. Smith to the prosecutors and the special agents in \norder to aid them in prosecuting Mr. Smith. Thus, the IRS-Inspection \nserved as a conduit of information harmful to the complainant in \nviolation of its clear promise that it would not do so.\n    That same special agent misconduct was a major issue in the \ncriminal trial of Mr. Smith. Fortunately, the jury correctly assessed \nthe evidence, and found the testimony of Mr. Smith and his two \nemployees was truthful. As a result, Mr. Smith and his codefendant were \nfound to be innocent of the tax crimes charged after less than one hour \nof jury deliberation.\n    Both the jury and the polygraph operator believed Mr. Smith and his \ntwo employees when they accused the two agents of perjury and other \nwrongful conduct, yet it is evident that no thorough investigative \neffort was ever pursued by IRS-Inspection, and apparently no corrective \naction was ever taken with respect to the two agents. Furthermore, no \ndisciplinary action was taken to punish the IRS-Inspection \ninvestigators who promised that the information given to IRS-Inspection \nwould not be given to the special agents and prosecutors until after \nthe trial, and then consciously and deliberately violated that promise. \nOIG-Treasury also later reviewed the case and met with Mr. Smith. No \ncorrective action was ever taken by OIG-Treasury."

"","","d'amato","Hon. Alfonse D'Amato","    Mr. Chairman, my name is Earl Epstein. I am a practicing lawyer and \na member of a small law firm in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I \nappreciate the invitation to testify before this Committee.\n    For the past 35 years I have been engaged in the private practice \nof tax law and during that period of time have represented numerous \ntaxpayers before the Internal Revenue Service. Of particular importance \ntoday is my experience in representing taxpayers who have been subject \nto collection proceedings by the Collection Division of the Internal \nRevenue Service.\n    As I am sure you are aware, the stated ``Mission'' of the Internal \nRevenue Service is ``. . . to collect the proper amount of tax revenue \nat the least cost; serve the public by continually improving the \nquality of our products and services; and perform in a manner \nwarranting the highest degree of public confidence in our integrity, \nefficiency, and fairness.'' The Services' ``Statement of Principles'' \ngoes on to say that administration should be conducted ``with great \ncourtesy and considerateness . . . should never try to overreach, and \nshould be reasonable within the bounds of law and sound \nadministration.'' These statements of principle are well publicized and \ncan be found posted in Internal Revenue Service waiting rooms around \nthe country. Unfortunately, taxpayers and their advocates have not \nalways found these principles to be followed with any degree of \nconsistency by the Collection Division.\n    By these remarks I do not mean to suggest that all Internal Revenue \nService Agents harass taxpayers, nor do I mean to suggest that all lie \nor overreach. Indeed, most IRS personnel that I have dealt with over \nthe years are hardworking, honest people who give their best efforts to \nadminister a confusing and difficult system in a fair and honorable \nmanner. However, it is also clear to me that harassment and \noverreaching by the Collection Division of the Internal Revenue Service \nis far from isolated and that. indeed, it could not continue at the \nrate that I have seen over the years without institutional approval of \nthese practices, whether that be an active approach or by passive \napproval.\n    Following your hearings on abuses of the Internal Revenue Service \nlast year I was somewhat chagrined at the contention of the Service \nthat reports of their misbehavior were ``exaggerated examples of rare \ninstances of inappropriate actions.'' This has not been my experience \nwith the Collection Division. In that context I would like to relate to \nyou just a few examples of the kind of unfortunate experiences which I \nhave faced in my years of practice before the Collection Division of \nthe Internal Revenue Service:\n  <bullet> Just a few months ago the Internal Revenue Service filed a \n        lien against a joint bank account held by a husband and wife as \n        tenants by the entireties. The debt for taxes, however, was \n        only that of the husband. Under Tennessee state law, which \n        applies in this instance, the lien is improper and may only be \n        filed against the survivorship interest of the husband, not the \n        present interest of the wife in the joint account. The \n        controlling case issued by the Tennessee Supreme Court was \n        cited to the Collection Division in Memphis. Nevertheless they \n        refused to release the lien, thereby placing a hold on the \n        funds of the wife, my client, which she sorely needed to feed \n        her children. Short of litigation, which was not economically \n        feasible in this instance, nothing could be done to persuade \n        the collection people in Memphis to release the lien.\n  <bullet> About two years ago a Collection Agent, attempting to \n        collect unpaid withholding tax, told my client that he could \n        pay the tax by a check from the attorney representing him at \n        that time and that, if he would do so, he would receive credit \n        against his personal withholding tax liability. After the \n        payment was made as directed, the Collection Agent instead \n        credited the payment to the corporate debt, rather than the \n        personal liability of the taxpayer. When I later brought this \n        matter to the attention of the agent, he denied his promise to \n        credit the personal liability and then, when I confronted him \n        with his oral agreement, he laughed and told me that ``it \n        wasn't in writing.'' This forced my client to pay an additional \n        $30,000 in tax with no recourse under the law.\n  <bullet> A few years ago a Collection Agent appeared in my office and \n        told my secretary that he wanted to consult with me on a \n        personal matter. When I invited him into my office he proceeded \n        to identify himself as an agent of the Collection Division of \n        the Internal Revenue Service and demanded access to my files on \n        one of my clients, a clear violation of the attorney client \n        privilege and clearly not a consultation on a ``personal \n        matter.'' When I asked him why he had lied to my secretary he \n        merely laughed and told me that ``sometimes we have to do \n        that.'' Of course, I threw him out of my office and wrote to \n        the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to report his action. I \n        was later advised by the office of the Commissioner of Internal \n        Revenue that the Agent received an unspecified disciplinary \n        action.\n  <bullet> Some years ago I represented a woman who owned and operated \n        a small beauty shop. The Collection Division had placed a lien \n        on her shop for unpaid taxes of approximately $175 and \n        proceeded to sell her shop equipment at auction, thereby \n        putting her out of business and embarrassing her in front of \n        her customers and friends. At the auction she had displayed to \n        the Collection Agent her canceled check with which she had paid \n        the claimed tax. The agent refused to listen to her and \n        proceeded with the sale. Subsequently I was retained as her \n        counsel. I obtained copies of the computer records of her \n        account from the Internal Revenue Service and was able to show \n        how they had made an erroneous double entry of the tax due on \n        their computer system, thereby making it seem that the taxpayer \n        owed tax when, in fact, this was not the case. Although the \n        Service acknowledged the error to me, they refused to make any \n        effort to make my client whole, even refusing to repay the \n        excess tax which they had collected by the sale of her property \n        on the grounds that the Statute of Limitations had expired on \n        the refund. Since the amount did not justify the expense of a \n        refund action in the United States District Court, and since \n        the law at that time did not permit an award of damages, there \n        was little I could do for her other than to write to her \n        Congressman to describe to him what had occurred. As a result \n        of that letter a private bill was introduced in the House of \n        Representatives which would have permitted her to bring an \n        action against the United States for damages in order to \n        compensate her for her loss. Unfortunately, the bill died in \n        committee. She was never compensated and never received an \n        apology. Her only solace was her ability to display the draft \n        of House Bill to her friends.\n  <bullet> For years a particular Collection Agent in Philadelphia lied \n        to me repeatedly on a number of cases. In order to protect the \n        guilty I will refer to him as Agent ``M.'' I reported his \n        actions to his supervisor on each occasion. On at least one \n        case he was thereafter removed from the case and another agent \n        assigned. Nevertheless Agent ``M'' appeared again and again on \n        cases I was handling and was obviously never sufficiently \n        reprimanded or dismissed for his conduct.\n  <bullet> Some years ago I represented a taxpayer who had been \n        severely harassed by the Government over a period of some ten \n        years, first by bringing two criminal actions against him, both \n        of which were dismissed by the Court, and then bringing a civil \n        action against him alleging income tax fraud, to collect tax on \n        the very allegations which were the subject of the dismissed \n        criminal suits. The matter was brought to the United States Tax \n        Court.\n  <bullet> In an effort to settle the Tax Court case we submitted an \n        Offer in Compromise along with the required statement of assets \n        and liabilities, executed under penalties of perjury. Our \n        friend, Agent ``M'' then instituted a criminal investigation \n        against my client but refused to tell me why he had done so, or \n        on what grounds he felt a crime had been committed. In a \n        hearing to quash a subpoena issued against my client a Judge of \n        the United States District Court in Philadelphia forced Agent \n        ``M'' to disclose the grounds of the criminal investigation. It \n        turned out that Agent ``M'' had decided on his own that my \n        client had failed to list a number of stocks on the Offer in \n        Compromise submission and therefore proceeded to push the \n        criminal investigation for lying under oath on the Offer form. \n        When informed of the grounds of his investigation I was able to \n        easily produce the stock certificates in the name of my client \n        as custodian for his children under the Uniform Gifts to Minors \n        Act, thereby showing that my client had no legal right to the \n        stocks and did not own them. As a result, my client had not \n        lied under oath on the Offer in Compromise submission. Agent \n        ``M'' had no compunction about harassing my client on false \n        grounds which could have been easily explained had he been \n        forthright and open in his dealings with me. My client, of \n        course, had to bear the cost of these proceedings.\n      During the course of the previously described hearing in the \n        District Court, Judge Norma Shapiro Court ordered Agent ``M'' \n        to cease all efforts at collection and investigation and \n        specifically forbade the agent from any contact with the \n        taxpayer or his family pending a ruling by the Court on the \n        validity of the claim which, of course, she later determined to \n        be invalid. Blatantly ignoring the order of the Court, Agent \n        ``M'' visited the home of the taxpayer's 80 year old mother at \n        five AM the next morning, threatened her, and demanded entrance \n        to search her garage. When the Court was advised of his actions \n        Judge Shapiro severely reprimanded Agent ``M'' in open court.\n      When the civil fraud case was eventually tried in the United \n        States Tax Court, the Court found for the taxpayer and \n        criticized the Internal Revenue Service, stating that the \n        actions of the Government could well have been viewed as a \n        personal vendetta against him. But, of course, that criticism, \n        although welcomed by the taxpayer, did nothing to repair the \n        damage that years of harassment caused him, nor did it \n        compensate him for the cost of two criminal trials, one \n    In 1977 the Congress amended the Consumer Credit Protection Act to \ninclude a new section known as the ``Fair Debt Collection Practices \ncollectors of ``consumer debt,'' is designed to prevent ``abusive, \n    Among other things it regulates the kind and place of \nofficer or employee of the United States to the extent that collecting \nexclusion is unfortunate in that, by implication, it permits an \nemployee of the Internal Revenue Service to engage in ``abusive, \ndeceptive and unfair debt collection practices'' that is prohibited in \nthe private sector.\n    I would urge this Committee to give careful consideration to \nlegislation making the Internal Revenue Service subject to the same \nrules of conduct which the Congress has imposed on the private sector, \nan interesting sidelight of which is a requirement of annual reports to \nthe Congress assessing the extent to which compliance is being \n                                endnotes\n        Court in Apothaker v.

"","","hatch","Hon. Orrin G. Hatch","    Thank you Mr. Chairman. Today we start an important series of \nhearings in our ongoing oversight of the Internal Revenue Service. For \ntoo long, Congress has been lax in their oversight function. The \nhearings this week illustrate that the Chairman and the Committee are \nnot just paying lip service to the important role we have regarding IRS \noversight.\n    There has been a lot of talk lately about the IRS becoming a \nservice-oriented agency--and I agree with that completely for the bulk \nof the taxpayer assistance, compliance, and collection activities. \nHowever, we must remember that the IRS is also a law enforcement \nagency. The Criminal Investigation Division is a very important part of \nthe IRS. Let's not forget that it was through enforcement of the tax \ncode that we were able to put Al Capone in prison--not all tax cheats \nare benign.\n    Throughout the debate on IRS reform, we have heard stories of \nabuses from IRS employees. Because there have been some bad apples in \nthe barrel, it would be easy to get the picture that all IRS employees \nare somehow mistreating the taxpayers they serve. This is not true. The \nvast majority of the IRS employees are honest, hard-working individuals \ndoing their best in an unpopular job. In my own state of Utah, we have \nthe top service center in the nation. The criminal investigations and \ncollections divisions are the same.\n    Are there mistakes being made or abusive situations allowed to \noccur? The testimony we will hear this week shows us that there are. \nThese abuses are serious and must be stopped. But, what we need to get \na clearer picture of is whether the stories we hear today are the \nexceptions or the rule.\n    As a law enforcement agency, the IRS must be subject to \nrestrictions on their authority and action to ensure adequate \nprotection of individuals rights. A strong system of checks and \nbalances must be built into any agency responsible for law enforcement \nactivities. This has also been my position relative to law enforcement \nagencies under the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. But, at the \nsame time, we must be very careful to ensure that any limits placed on \nthe law enforcement--in this case, the IRS--will still allow the agency \nto conduct thorough, professional, and fair criminal investigations and \nbring those who are willfully disobeying the law to justice. The \nmillions of honest taxpayers in America should not be rewarded for \ntheir honesty by government's allowing those who cheat to get away with \nit.\n    I look forward to the testimony we will hear this week. These \nhearings will help us to ensure that the IRS is enforcing the laws \nfairly and justly. This is what the American people want. They do not \nwant tax cheats to go free. Several recent polls have shown that as \nmuch as the public dislikes the IRS, they hate the tax cheats more. We \nmust make sure that in our quest for a kinder, gentler IRS we do not \nunduly hamper the important law enforcement role that it plays in our \nsociety."

"","","kerrey","Hon. Bob Kerrey","    Mr. Chairman, good news came to American taxpayers on November 5, \n1997, when historic IRS reform legislation, based on the work of the \nbipartisan, bicameral National Commission on Restructuring the IRS, \npassed the House of Representatives 426-4. However, the bad news has \ncome every day since to the American taxpayers, because, five months \nlater--and eight months since this committee had its first hearings on \nthis matter--IRS reform legislation has not yet passed in the Senate.\n    While I was encouraged by the general thrust of the proposal that \npassed out of this committee unanimously last month, I am disappointed \nin the time it has taken for the Senate to act. We have taken months to \npass legislation that is not unlike what the National Commission on \nRestructuring the IRS's final report recommended, or what was passed by \nthe House of Representatives.\n    The one major difference is the cost: the Senate bill costs nearly \n$20 billion over ten years, and nearly half of that is not paid for.\n    While these additional hearings serve the public good--the American \npeople already know what the IRS is capable of and want and deserve \naction. These hearings will mean nothing if we do not change the law.\n    I am not an IRS apologist. It is an agency that has been left to \nits own devices for far too long--50 some years--and has functioned \nunder a culture that presumes taxpayers are guilty until proven \ninnocent, even though 85% of Americans voluntarily file their taxes \nwillingly and without incident. That is why Congressman Portman and I, \nand Senator Richard Shelby and I before that, embarked on reform \nefforts to begin with--we knew there was a dire need to overhaul the \nIRS.\n    According to statistics compiled by the National Commission on \nRestructuring the IRS, the IRS receives roughly 238,000 calls per day--\nbut half of those callers do not get through to an IRS representative. \nOf the callers that do get through, nearly 19,000 are given wrong \ninformation. In addition, the IRS sends out roughly 114,000 notices per \nday, but does not have an internal management mechanism in place to \nensure that what is in those notices is completely accurate.\n    It would be easy to blame the new IRS Commissioner, Charles \nRossotti for these short comings. But the reality of the situation is \nthat he lacks--as did commissioners before him--the statutory authority \nto make the significant technological, personnel and management changes \nto correct most of what is wrong with the IRS. And the fault for that \nlies with Congress.\n    Congress created the IRS, Mr. Chairman, not the other way around. \nThe IRS is not Sears & Roebuck. We wrote the laws, we changed the tax \ncode, we were responsible for oversight--535 members of Congress serve \nas the board of directors. It is no wonder we are so eager to point the \nfinger elsewhere. But the American taxpayers are not fooled. When the \nNational Commission on Restructuring the IRS held our field hearings \nthe people who we talked to--taxpayers, accountants, lawyers, IRS \nemployees--all knew that Congress had a big hand in this mess. In fact \na majority of them thought Congress was more of a problem than the IRS.\n    From those hearings and from that experience, language was created \nfor IRS reform legislation that not only benefits American taxpayers by \nimproving IRS service and procedures--but also changes the way our tax \nlaws are written.\n    In both the House Bill and the Senate Finance Committee legislation \nthere are key Congressional accountability provisions that are vital to \nreforming the IRS and the way Congress adopts changes to the tax code. \nBoth plans require a Tax Complexity Analysis of all new tax legislation \nso that every new tax proposal will be evaluated on its complexity and \ncost for taxpayers and to the IRS before it is voted on in Congress. A \nTax Complexity Analysis will discourage tax complexity and stop the \ntendency of Congress to constantly alter and complicate the tax code \nwithout considering the ramifications to taxpayers and the IRS.\n    The just passed Coverdell Education IRA bill, which would be the \n64th tax law added to the books since 1986, is an example of how \nCongress passes tax law without considering the cost of administering \nthis new tax law and its real impact on the American taxpayers it is \nsupposed to help. The prospects are dizzying.\n    This legislation allows for tax-free withdrawals from education \naccounts for room and board, uniforms, transportation expenses or \nsupplementary items or services--but only if these things are required \nor provided by the school. So this new law will not only require \nfamilies to have a pretty sophisticated understanding of the law before \nthey take their money out, it also appears that to be on the right side \nof the law, parents would need to be able to justify their expenditures \nwith detailed records.\n    The questions then are: Who is going to be checking those records? \nWill the IRS be asking taxpayers to submit bus fare receipts and \nclothing bills with their tax returns? Will these receipts be required \nin an audit situation?\n    Also, the bill would sunset in 2002. If the President signs this \nlegislation, we will have established three separate rules governing \neducation savings accounts. This year, we have education savings \naccounts that can be used for higher education but not K-12. Next year \nand through the year 2002, we have different rules which allow tax-free \nwithdrawals from these accounts. After 2003, K-12 withdrawals could be \nmade, but only from the contributions and earnings from 1999 to 2002.\n    How will taxpayers know how much of what they take out is tax-free? \nHow will the IRS know? How will the IRS attempt to explain these new \nrules to taxpayers and who will understand them? Will anyone \nunderstand?\n    Passing legislation like this, while complaining about how the IRS \nadministers the tax code and services the taxpayer is the wrong \ndirection to head. And while Commissioner Rossotti and American \ntaxpayers wait for IRS reform legislation to be passed by this body, \nthey are left to suffer the consequences of an agency in critical need \nof reform and a Congress that can pass tax law without considering the \nlaw's ramifications on taxpayers or the agency.\n    I am also troubled that there are no taxpayer compliance issues on \nthe agenda for these hearings. We will hear more stories about IRS \nabuses--which we already know exist--but we will not hear any testimony \non how a small percentage of American taxpayers continue to abuse our \nvoluntary system at a great price to the large percentage of Americans \nwho do not.\n    Willful noncompliance with our nation's tax laws cost taxpayers an \nestimated $100 billion annually. According to a special Harris Poll \nbe more widespread than harassment by the IRS.'' The poll found that by \na margin of 50% to 33%, Americans believe more people ``get away with \nnot paying all the taxes they should'' than pay ``all their taxes and \nare unfairly harassed by the IRS.''\n    Yet we will not hear testimony about tax cheats such as the one \nreported in the Washington Post on April 23 in which a husband and wife \nteam, who owned a tax business in Maryland, filed 333 fraudulent tax \nreturns and wound up pocketing nearly $700,000--until the IRS caught up \nwith them.\n    If we are going to shine a spotlight on the problems of our tax \nsystem let's shine the light everywhere, not just on the areas that \nmake the most convenient headlines.\n    The simple fact is, more Americans pay taxes than vote. How the IRS \noperates and treats taxpayers is a direct reflection of how Americans \nfeel their government treats them--and by most accounts the treatment \nthey receive is not good. Action on legislation will not only put the \nIRS on the right track and provide American taxpayers with an agency \nthat more resembles a financial institution than a law enforcement \nentity, it will also go a long way toward repairing the public's \nperception that we truly are a government of, by and for the people."

"","","kerrey","Hon. Bob Kerrey","    Mr. Chairman, I first want to thank you for holding these hearings, \nand although I will state again for the record my disappointment that \nthese hearings were too one sided in their content and that the \nwitnesses through no fault of their own were woefully unprepared to \ndiscuss the legislation we will be debating next week, these hearings \nwill have yielded some positive results.\n    I want to thank Commissioner Rossotti for not only coming forward \nand talking to the Committee today after a tough week, but I also want \nto thank him for agreeing to take on the monumental task of overhauling \nthis agency. I have been at this reform effort since 1995 and can \nappreciate his task. I think his willingness to serve his country in \nthis manner deserves our full recognition and appreciation.\n    Mr. Chairman, a consistent theme of your hearings and of our report \nout of the National Commission on Restructuring the IRS is how can we \nchange the culture of the IRS to make it more taxpayer service \noriented? In order for this change of culture to be real and lasting, \nit will take time. My concern has always been that we hold these \nhearings, receive a lot of press, the IRS hunkers down for a time, and \nthen they go back to business as usual.\n    The question, really, before us is how do we make lasting change?\n    The legislation we reported out a few weeks ago should go a long \nway towards making sure that the IRS really undergoes a fundamental and \npermanent change of culture. We want the oversight to be real and \nlasting.\n    One of the provisions in the legislation attempts, and maybe it \ndoes not go far enough, to consolidate and institutionalize annual \nCongressional oversight. Nothing changes a bureaucracy more than \nknowing that Congress will be asking them to come before them annually \nto discuss problems and prod them in the right direction. But, Congress \nshould not be exempt from reforms.\n    Mr. Chairman, I would like to suggest to you that the Committee \nconsider changes to its own internal bylaws to institutionalize our \noversight.\n  <bullet> First, we should require that the Committee meet every year \n        on a set date, say, the second Tuesday of May. The Committee \n        would meet with the Commissioner of the IRS and the Chairman of \n        the Oversight Board to review a select number of the cases that \n        have been referred by the IG, under our IRS restructuring \n        legislation, to the Oversight Board.\n  <bullet> Second, we should give the particular IRS employees a chance \n        to respond to the accusations raised by the IG report. It \n        should be voluntary, but they should have the chance to explain \n        their actions.\n  <bullet> And third, we need to institutionalize Committee follow up \n        to these IG reports. We need to know what actions did the \n        agency take on a specific case? What policies were changed?\n    Indeed, perhaps we should change the legislation to require a \nfollow up report from the IRS Oversight Board to this Committee.\n    Mr. Chairman, my hope is that after both of us are long gone from \nthis institution that some future Finance Committee doesn't suddenly \nwake up to the importance of IRS oversight. One of your greatest \nlegacies for this Committee could be the regular, institutionalized \noversight of this important agency. I will do everything in my power to \nsee that this legacy comes to pass.\n    Thank you."

"","","kerrey","Hon. Bob Kerrey","    Dear Senator Moynihan: A number of witnesses at this week's Senate \nFinance Committee hearing presented testimony alleging improper actions \nby the Internal Revenue Service in specific cases. Following this \ntestimony, several members of the Committee noted that the IRS was \nprohibited by law from responding to these allegations. This letter \nsummarizes the limitations the IRS may face when asked to respond in \npublic to allegations made in specific cases by witnesses who appear \nbefore the Committee.\n    Disclosure Restrictions Under IRC Section 6103. As you are aware, \nsection 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code requires the IRS to protect \nthe confidentiality of tax returns and return information. A witness \nmay discuss his or her own tax information before the Committee in a \npublic hearing; the IRS, however, may not discuss that same case in a \npublic hearing unless the taxpayer specifically authorizes the IRS to \ndo so. Moreover, any given case may involve taxpayer information not \nonly of the witness who appears before the Committee, but also \ninformation about other taxpayers; and some cases may involve a \nmultitude of taxpayers. In order to present a case fully, a separate \nauthorization would have to be obtained from each taxpayer whose \ninformation is to be discussed.\n    Rules of Grand Jury Secrecy. Under Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules \nof Criminal Procedure, grand jury information may not be disclosed by \ngovernment personnel except under very limited conditions. In general, \nthe limitations imposed by Rule 6(e) are even more restrictive than \nsection 6103; for example, government personnel who are authorized to \nreceive grand jury information are prohibited even from disclosing the \ninformation to their supervisors (unless the supervisor is separately \nincluded on the list of authorized personnel). Violations of grand jury \nsecrecy are punishable by imprisonment for criminal contempt of court. \nThe prohibition against disclosure of grand jury information continues \neven after the investigation is closed, and cannot be waived by the \ntarget of the investigation.\n    Cases Pending in Litigation. Public comment about cases pending in \nlitigation can prejudice the proper resolution of the matter and \nadversely affect the rights of the parties. If a case is pending in \ncourt, it should be resolved through judicial process, according to the \nrules of evidence and procedure. For this reason, the IRS has \nmaintained a longstanding practice not to discuss publicly cases that \nare pending in litigation, even if the taxpayer chooses to make public \nstatements about the matter. This policy against public comment about \ncases pending in litigation effectively precludes the IRS from \naddressing a number of the matters raised by witnesses before the \nCommittee this week.\n    In addition to these legal and policy considerations, there are \nalso practical limitations on the IRS' ability to respond in public \nsessions to allegations regarding the handling of specific cases. The \nIRS must have time to retrieve and review case files in order to \nprepare its testimony; this process is complex and time consuming. We \nbelieve the IRS generally best serves the needs of congressional \noversight by providing a wider systemic perspective on issues that \nother witnesses may raise in the context of individual cases."

"","","kerrey","Hon. Bob Kerrey","    The asset forfeiture program has become an effective tool in the \nFederal Government's anti-crime strategy against drug trafficking, \nmoney laundering and organized crime. The IRS and other government \nagencies use the forfeiture laws to dismantle criminal enterprises by \nseizing and obtaining title to their assets. The Comprehensive Crime \nControl Act of 1984 created the legal tools to mount an aggressive \nnational forfeiture program. Passage of the Anti-Drug Abuse Acts of \n1986 and 1988 enhanced the use of these tools.\n    The Anti-Drug Abuse Laws of 1986 and 1988 provided IRS with civil \nand criminal statutes to seize and forfeit assets used in unlawful \nactivities. These assets include the proceeds from drug trafficking and \nmoney laundering and any assets used to commit these crimes. For \nexample, persons selling drugs from their home would not only forfeit \nthe drugs and the money they received from their home drug sales; but \nthey would also forfeit their home.\n                          jackson, mississippi\n    IRS special agents utilized their financial expertise of following \nmoney and identifying assets while working a major narcotics \ninvestigation in Jackson, Mississippi. As a result a building, located \nat 901 N. Parish Street, was seized in the Edward Charles Johnson case. \nThis building, known as Big John's Recreational Center, was seized in \nlate 1994 a part of a federal prosecution of drug charges. IRS-CI found \nthat Johnson intentionally omitted over $390,000 in gross income from \nhis federal income tax return during the years 1988-1991 and attempted \nto conceal his income by laundering the money through nominee names and \nbusinesses.\n    In a dedication ceremony on August 16, 1995, the former Big John's \nRecreational Center was presented to the YMCA to be converted into a \nYMCA Teen Crisis Center as part of the federal government ``Weed and \nSeed'' program. The Crisis Center welcomes pregnant teens, teenage \ndropouts, runaways, teens on drugs or teens facing any other crisis. \nThe former Center was a place neighbors remember because of its noise, \nfighting shooting and drug dealing. All agencies participating in the \ninvestigation were praised for taking a thorn in the side of the \nneighborhood and turning it into something positive.\n                  middle judicial district of florida\n    As a result of an OCDETF investigation in the Middle Judicial \nDistrict of Florida in the early 1990's, numerous individuals were \nprosecuted. The investigation also resulted in the seizure and \nforfeiture of a night club and liquor store known as the Inner Circle \nLounge. This bar had been utilized by several major narcotics \ntraffickers over the years. A special agent with the IRS--Criminal \nInvestigation in the South Florida District testified at length during \nthe forfeiture trial of the night club. As a result of this testimony, \na guilty verdict on the property was received. The verdict was appealed \nall the way to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court chose not to hear \nthe appeal and the forfeiture verdict was upheld. The IRS--Criminal \nInvestigation was instrumental in the final disposition of the \nproperty. The forfeiture became part of the federally funded ``Weed & \nSeed'' program. The government identified ``The Quality Life Center of \nSouthwest Florida'', which operated out of rented space for over six \nyears and was in desperate need of expanding its operation. The non-\nprofit center offers programs for youths such as martial arts, \nswimming, tutoring and educational programs all designed to teach self-\nreliance. In September of 1997, United States Attorney Charles Wilson \npresented the deed for the property to the director of the Quality Life \nCenter in a ceremony held at the 7500 square foot facility. The \ndirector described the new facility as a ``an oasis of opportunity, \nlearning and growth.''"

"","","kerrey","Hon. Bob Kerrey","    I commend Chairman Roth and the Finance Committee staff, for \nkeeping a spotlight focused on the IRS. The culture of waste, fraud, \nand abuse that was uncovered when our oversight hearings began last \nSeptember was no surprise to the millions of taxpayers who have had \nunpleasant interactions with the IRS.\n    The arrogant and abusive IRS has been a long time in the making. It \nis the result of years of inadequate oversight by past IRS \nCommissioners, by past Treasury Secretaries, and by past Presidents. \nBut the Congress must share in the blame. As the people's voice, eyes, \nand ears, the Congress through its oversight powers has a crucial role \nin keeping our society free.\n    Congress is in the best position to check the misuse of Executive \npower. Mr. Chairman, by revitalizing the oversight function of this \nCommittee, you are providing a crucial service to our citizen \ntaxpayers. We cannot allow this oversight to wane. The IRS interacts \nwith more Americans than any other government agency in the country, \nand these interactions are not limited to April 15th. Indeed, taxpayers \nhave greater reason to be upset with Congress than with the IRS at this \ntime of the year, as the record amount of taxes being taken by the \nfederal government, and the complexity of the tax code (caused in large \npart by the current Administration's obsession with income caps and \nphase-outs), cannot be blamed on the IRS.\n    But there is a lot that can be blamed on the IRS. Our hearings last \nSeptember exposed a rogue agency that was literally out of control. We \nlearned about the illegal use of enforcement statistics to evaluate IRS \nemployee performance--in other words, judging employees based on how \nmuch they say the taxpayers owe. We heard testimony that IRS management \nencourages IRS employees to mislead and lie to taxpayers about their \nrights, and to fabricate evidence against taxpayers and fellow \nemployees. We learned that IRS management encourages IRS employees to \nignore tax code provisions that would result in a favorable adjustment \nto taxpayers, and to violate the laws concerning taxpayer privacy and \nthe commencement of liens, levies, and seizures. This was shocking. \nTaxpayers who spend more than $8 billion to run the IRS deserve at \nleast honest service.\n    But our September hearings revealed that the IRS views itself more \nas a law enforcer rather than a service provider. We heard that many \nIRS managers believe that all tax debtors are tax cheats that must be \npunished. This is hard to accept. IRS employees, of all people, should \nrecognize that our complex tax code can easily lead to innocent \nmistakes on the part of well-meaning taxpayers. The attitude of \nantagonism toward the taxpayer must end.\n    The IRS restructuring and reform bill will begin to correct many of \nthese problems--particularly by increasing taxpayer confidentiality, \ncorrecting the presumption that the IRS is always right and the \ntaxpayer always wrong, and treating the Service as it treats the \ntaxpayer by making it pay for its mistakes.\n    The IRS cannot operate in a vacuum and disregard the rights and \nneeds of taxpayers. Fiscal mismanagement and negligence only undermine \ntaxpayers' faith in the fairness of any tax system. Outright abuse and \nharassment destroy this faith. We cannot tolerate an IRS that treats \nregular citizens like violent criminals, and that acts itself as if it \nwere the collections arm of racketeers.\n    The problems existing at the IRS have been decades in the making, \nand we cannot expect them to go away without constant vigilance on the \npart of this Committee. We must continue to provide the oversight \nnecessary to get the IRS back in line."

"","","kerrey","Hon. Bob Kerrey","Re: Hearings on IRS Misconduct"
break,break,break,break
"","","kerrey","Hon. Bob Kerrey","    Dear Chairman Roth: This firm is counsel to William A. Moncrief, \nJr., one of the non-government witnesses who testified at last week's \nhearing concerning the activities of the IRS. During the course of Mr. \nMoncrief's appearance before the Committee on Finance, Senators Kerrey \nand Mack asked for his comments on the Internal Revenue Service \nRestructuring and Reform Act of 1998, Approved by Senate Finance \nCommittee as Substitute for House-Passed Version (H.R. 2676). In \nparticular, Mr. Moncrief was asked during his formal testimony on \nWednesday, April, 2-9, 1998, to comment on Titles I, III, and IV of the \nFinance Committee's version of the legislation. He asked for, and was \ngiven, an opportunity to review the legislation and to discuss it with \nhis counsel. This letter constitutes his response to the Senators' \nquestions about the legislation during the hearing.\n    Title I of the Bill concerns reorganizing the structure and \nmanagement of the Internal Revenue Service. It would create a six-\nmember board to oversee the management, administration, conduct, \ndirection and supervision of the Service. Three of those members would \nbe affiliated with Treasury or the IRS, and would include: the \nSecretary or Deputy Secretary of Treasury; the IRS Commissioner; and a \nrepresentative of the IRS employees' union. A quorum would consist of \nfive members and it would conduct business by a simple majority vote.\n    If the purpose of these provisions is to provide active independent \noversight of the Service and its management, the board would be heavily \nweighted in favor of the agency and agency interests, rather than \ntaxpayers. Greater independence could be achieved with fewer Treasury-\naffiliated members or more outside members representing the taxpaying \npublic's interest. As in the corporate world, a board of directors \nheavily weighted in favor of directors affiliated with management is \nlikely to be a rubber-stamp for management decisions. It is essential \nthat the insular IRS culture that has made it insensitive to the \ntaxpaying public be meaningfully counterbalanced by a board having \ngreater independence from the agency than is contemplated in the \ncurrent legislation.\n    In addition, the current legislation contemplates the oversight \nboard's review of ``procedures of the Internal Revenue Service relating \nto financial audits required by law.'' Under this statutory wording, \nthe IRS could contend that the oversight board lacks jurisdiction to \nreview or even consider procedures relating to criminal tax \ninvestigations. The Criminal Investigation Division would be emboldened \nto feel, therefore, that it has a mandate for treating its procedures \nand actions as essentially unreviewable. This mandate could subject \nmore, rather than fewer, taxpayers to the kind of stomach-turning \ninvestigative overkill suffered by the Moncriefs.\n    Title I of the Bill would also create the Office of the Taxpayer \nAdvocate under the supervision of the National Taxpayer Advocate. This \noffice would have the power to assist taxpayers by proposing ``changes \nin the administrative practices of the Internal Revenue Service'' and \nby identifying ``potential legislative changes which may be \nappropriate'' to mitigate taxpayer problems in dealing with the IRS. \nThis mandate includes a broad catchall to report to the House Ways and \nMeans Committee and the Senate Finance Committee ``such other \ninformation as the National Taxpayer Advocate may deem advisable.'' \nThis advisory role does not explicitly include criminal investigations, \nthe use of paid informants, or the use of search warrants. However, the \nstatutory language may be broad enough to include oversight of the \nService's ``paramilitary'' activities. If there is any doubt, Mr. \nMoncrief would favor clearly giving the National Taxpayer Advocate \nauthority to advise Congress and make legislative recommendations \nconcerning inappropriate uses of such law enforcement tools against \nnonviolent taxpayers.\n    Title I also creates the new, independent office of Treasury \nInspector General for Tax Administration. Its purpose is to conduct \nauditing and investigating functions concerning the activities of the \nInternal Revenue Service. This would be a welcome change, if it results \nin real investigations of the conduct of IRS personnel not perfunctory \nwhitewashes of agent wrongdoing. One major problem Mr. Moncrief had \nafter the investigation ended was getting the IRS Inspection Division \nto take a serious, honest, and thorough look at the conduct of the \nagents who had initiated the massive raid on his business and had \npursued the investigation long after it was clear that the Moncriefs \nhad committed no crime. This bill could change all that.\n    Title III addresses a whole series of new taxpayer protections and \nrights. This title contains a number of welcome safeguards for \ntaxpayers, but it does not include any protections against making \noutrageous payments to informers, using search warrants against \nnonviolent taxpayers in criminal tax cases, or demanding releases from \ncivil liability for illegal searches and other wrongful conduct. \nAlthough this title would help some taxpayers, it would not put any \nrestriction on the activities of the Criminal Investigation Division. \nMr. Moncrief urges the Committee to place statutory restrictions on the \nuse of search warrants in routine criminal tax investigations involving \nnonviolent taxpayers and to limit the rewards paid to informers.\n    The major lesson of the Moncrief investigation is that it was \nsimply too easy for a greedy disgruntled employee to retaliate by \ngenerating a full-scale criminal tax investigation on the basis of \nfalse or misleading information. Accordingly, the taxpayer rights \nportion of the legislation should limit the ability of informers to \ngenerate criminal investigations of other taxpayers or, at a minimum, \nrequire the IRS to investigate such leads thoroughly with less \nintrusive means than a search warrant. Finally, there is no question \nthat the Committee should include a provision barring the government \nfrom resolving any tax case in exchange for a release from statutory or \nother liability for its investigating agents.\n    The Internal Revenue Code currently affords IRS criminal \ninvestigators broad authority to obtain evidence using summonses. The \nService should not be permitted to use more drastic means--such as \nsearch warrants--to obtain information from taxpayers without \ndemonstrating that the use of summonses would be unavailing. Finally, \ncourt rulings have held that the IRS need not follow its internal \nprocedures for handling investigations. IRS criminal investigators \nshould be required to adhere strictly to internal review procedures and \nnot be permitted routinely to inflict the tools of the Drug War on \nnonviolent taxpayers. Mr. Moncrief believes that the taxpayer rights \nportion of the legislation would be substantially improved, if it \nincluded such safeguards relating to the handling of criminal tax \ninvestigations.\n    Finally, Mr. Moncrief favors the congressional accountability \nprovisions in Title IV of the Bill. Certainly the Internal Revenue Code \nis very complicated and these provisions would make simplification a \ncongressional priority. One area, which is not mentioned in the \nproposed legislation, concerns statutory amendments relating to the \nconduct of criminal investigations by the IRS. In all such instances, \nproper respect for taxpayer rights should be an important consideration \nand the Commissioner should be required, as with all other tax \nlegislation, to report on such matters to the House Committee on Ways \nand Means and the Senate Committee on Finance. The IRS should not be \npermitted to urge legislation infringing or limiting taxpayer rights \nbefore other Committees in Congress in a way that might result in \ninsufficient consideration of taxpayer rights. Several of the Senators \nnoted in the hearing that the use of the statutory weapons used to \nfight the Drug War were never intended to be used against nonviolent \nand non-drug-related taxpayers. Yet Mr. Moncrief's experience shows \nthat they, in fact, are.\n    We appreciate the opportunity to comment on Mr. Moncrief's behalf \non the pending legislation, and, as he stated at the hearing, he \ngreatly appreciates the Committee's time and gracious consideration of \nhis case. We believe that great strides are being made properly to \nbalance taxpayer rights against IRS powers. Please do not hesitate to \ncontact me, if the Committee needs anything further."

"","","moynihan","Daniel Patrick Moynihan","    Mr. Chairman: We thank you for your continuing commitment to \noversight of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The United States \nbegan as a Nation in protest against taxation that was improper and \nillegal, and for more than two centuries the issue has never been far \nfrom our concerns. However, not until last September had the Finance \nCommittee exercised its oversight jurisdiction. It is our duty to know \nwhat is going on in this large public agency, which was founded in 1862 \nwhen the Federal Government for the first time imposed an income tax.\n    Since our hearings last September, the Committee has taken two \nimportant actions to address the problems at the IRS. First, we \napproved unanimously the nomination of Charles O. Rossotti to be \nCommissioner of Internal Revenue. He was then confirmed unanimously by \nthe full Senate. I join with the Chairman in congratulating \nCommissioner Rossotti for his leadership since being sworn in not quite \nsix months ago. That agency needs energy, and Commissioner Rossotti is \nproviding it. He has put in motion a plan to modernize the agency by \nreorganizing according to type of taxpayer or tax (e.g. individual, \nsmall business, large corporate, excise taxes), rather than according \nto function (e.g. examination, collection, customer service) or \ngeography. Mr. Rossotti has also appointed former Comptroller General \nCharles Bowsher to perform an independent review of the IRS Inspection \nService; established programs to improve the treatment of taxpayers; \nand has announced a comprehensive plan to improve the IRS Criminal \nInvestigation Division that includes an independent review of its \nactivities and operations to be led by an expert in Federal law \nenforcement. This is important because, as we are about to hear, there \nare some real problems in the Criminal Division. I would think today's \ntestimony by the tax attorneys may lead to disciplinary action or even \ndismissals for some Criminal Division employees.\n    In addition to getting a strong Commissioner in place, the \nCommittee also reported out, by a vote of 20 to 0, the IRS \nRestructuring and Reform Act of 1998. We look forward to that \nlegislation's early approval by the Senate and its enactment as soon as \npossible.\n    Two further points. We must continue to attend to problems of abuse \nand other organizational matters. But until we simplify the Internal \nRevenue Code, we will fail to address the heart of the problem. I \ncontinue to be concerned about the effects on taxpayer compliance and \non tax administration of increasing tax code complexity resulting from \nfrequent statutory changes enacted by Congress. Mr. Chairman, we would \nlike to work with you to try to reduce tax evasion in the United \nStates, which according to some estimates costs taxpayers more than \n$100 billion per year. Finally, I thank the Chairman and Commissioner \nRossotti for the attention they have devoted to the Year 2000 computer \nconversion at the IRS. The Chairman's request that $50 million in \nunspent IRS funds (from fiscal years 1993-1997) be made immediately \navailable to the IRS for reprogramming will help insure that the IRS \nhas the resources necessary to address this problem. I also appreciate \nthe Chairman's willingness to look at the effective dates of provisions \nin the IRS Reform bill and consider moving some beyond January 1, 2000. \nThe Commissioner has made the Y2K problem his highest priority, as well \nit should be. This could be a crisis, both in the IRS and in the \neconomy generally. As the Commissioner has said, ``twenty-one months \nfrom now, there could be 90 million taxpayers who won't get their \nrefunds, and 95% of the revenue stream of the United States could be \njeopardized.'' Economists are concerned about the possibility of \nworldwide recession, and just last week Andrew Grove, the CEO of Intel \nCorporation, stated that ``the Federal government faces an ugly \nsituation if it does not step up efforts to correct the Year 2000 \nprogramming error in its agencies' computers.'' I am pleased that the \nSenate is forming the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology \nProblem to oversee the progress both in government and in the private \nsector on this matter.\n    I thank the Chairman and look forward to hearing from our \nwitnesses."

"","","moynihan","Daniel Patrick Moynihan","    Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, I appear before you today \nto discuss our investigative work at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \nsince the September IRS hearings before this Committee. As the Deputy \nAssistant Inspector General for Investigations, I have overseen our \noffice's investigations of the IRS, and will discuss some of these \nrecent investigations.\n    The hearings held before this Committee last September produced \nseveral groups of allegations which were referred for investigation to \nthe Treasury Office of Inspector General (OIG). Telephone calls to the \nOIG hotline more than doubled in response to those hearings. This \nprovided a serious challenge to our investigative resources as the OIG \nOffice of Investigations has the responsibility for investigating all \nemployees at the eight non-law enforcement bureaus, as well as senior \nlevel officials and all employees in the Offices of Inspection, \nInternal Affairs and Chief Counsel at each of the four law enforcement \nbureaus. The OIG staffing was insufficient to conduct the number of \nsignificant cases that warranted investigation. Because of this, many \nissues had to be returned to the bureaus for action because we lacked \nthe resources to pursue all allegations.\n    As a result of the September 1997 hearings, this office received \nfour significant allegations involving misconduct by IRS officials. All \nof the allegations were investigated. However, due to our limited \nresources, we could only independently conduct one of the \ninvestigations, and we had to commit most of our investigators, for \nfive months, from one of our three regional offices to conduct the \ninvestigation. We requested IRS Inspection to conduct two \ninvestigations. The fourth investigation was conducted by the OIG, but \nassistance was needed from three IRS Inspectors and two Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) agents.\n    The four allegations pertained to a series of complaints involving \nIRS mismanagement and mistreatment of taxpayers, the use of collection \nstatistics by IRS Collection Division managers to determine employee \nand group ratings, the establishment of an IRS national policy \nregarding the use of collection statistics, and reprisals against IRS \nemployees who testified before this Committee.\n    Because of its large scope, we referred the allegation regarding \nthe questionable use of collection statistics to the IRS Chief \nInspector's Office. Subsequently, we reviewed their work with the \nassistance of experienced investigators on detail to us from the other \nTreasury law enforcement bureaus--ATF, the U.S. Secret Service, and the \nU.S. Customs Service.\n    Our office investigated the allegations made by Jennifer Long \nregarding the IRS Houston office. This was a substantial investigation \ninvolving most of our Houston office.\n    Senator Nickles in the February 5th Finance Committee hearing, \nrequested that we investigate a group of allegations he received \nregarding the Internal Revenue Service. We obtained the assistance of \ninvestigators from ATF and the IRS to work under OIG supervision on \nthese allegations.\n                               background\n    The difficulties we encounter in performing our investigative \nmission are the result of a unique oversight structure. The result, \ndeveloped over the last 20 years, hampered procedurally and in terms of \nresources. When the Inspector General Act of 1978 was being debated, \nthe question of having an Inspector General for the Department of the \nTreasury was discussed extensively. A major item of debate was the \nInspector General's access to the programs, activities and functions of \nthe Department of the Treasury law enforcement bureaus: the ATF, the \nCustoms Service, the Secret Service, and IRS. Initially, it was decided \nnot to have a statutory OIG for the Treasury, but this debate continued \nfor the next 10 years.\n    In the meantime, the Treasury Department established an \nadministrative Inspector General, but it was small and did not include \nthe internal audit and internal investigative units of the four law \nenforcement bureaus. In 1986, GAO recommended that the Congress \nestablish a statutory Office of Inspector General at the Department of \nthe Treasury. The GAO also suggested that Congress consider special \nlegislative provisions to accommodate the Department's concerns over \nthe possible disclosure of sensitive law enforcement and tax \ninformation.\n    When the Inspector General concept was expanded with the Inspector \nGeneral Act Amendments of 1988, Congress created a statutory Inspector \nGeneral in Treasury despite continued concerns about access to the law \nenforcement bureaus. As with other Departments that handle sensitive \nmatters, Congress acknowledged that some special provisions were \nrequired. Accordingly, Congress created a unique structure for the \nTreasury Inspector General. Under the 1988 Amendments, the internal \naudit functions of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the \nCustoms Service and the Secret Service were transferred to the \nDepartment of the Treasury's Office of Inspector General. However, \nthose three bureaus retained their internal investigative units. The \nOffice of Inspector General was given oversight, but not supervisory \nauthority, for those internal investigative units.\n                         investigative process\n    With respect to the IRS, the internal audit and investigative \nfunctions were retained by the IRS Chief Inspector. As defined by the \nCongress and the Department's implementing procedures, the Inspector \nGeneral's authority is carried out through an oversight, as opposed to \nsupervisory, function that determines the degree of compliance with \napplicable professional standards and with Departmental and Service \npolicies and procedures.\n    The IRS Office of the Chief Inspector performs one of the most \nimportant audit and investigative functions in the Government, but has \nnone of the elements of independence provided to the Presidentially-\nappointed Inspectors General. The OIG, in order to ensure the most \ncomprehensive coverage, routinely investigates alleged misconduct by \nsenior-level IRS officials (officials in positions at the grade 15 \nlevel or higher) and employees in the Office of Inspection and the \nOffice of the Chief Counsel. As the Chief Counsel reports to the \nGeneral Counsel for the Department of the Treasury, the Office of \nInspector General has sole audit and investigative jurisdiction of that \noffice. Usually, the Office of Inspector General refers allegations \ninvolving IRS employees who are in positions at the grade 14 level, and \nsometimes 15, or below, to the Internal Revenue Service for appropriate \naction. Since most taxpayer complaints are made against employees at \nthis level, currently, our office has only minor involvement in \ntaxpayer complaints against the IRS.\n    The result of this action is that the IRS Chief Inspector has \nprimary cognizance for internal audit and investigative activities in \nthe Service. The Chief Inspector pursues his mission through two major \norganizational components Internal Audit and Internal Security. The IRS \nOffice of the Chief Inspector carries out its duties with approximately \n1200 FTEs located in the four IRS regional offices and its National \nOffice.\n    organizational structure and resources for oversight commitments\n    Within our Office of Investigations, we have approximately 46 FTEs, \nwhich include 33 criminal investigators, to conduct investigations at \nthe twelve Treasury bureaus. With this staffing, we have responsibility \nfor investigating all employees at the eight non-law enforcement \nbureaus, as well as senior level officials and all employees in the \nOffices of Inspection, Internal Affairs and Chief Counsel at the four \nlaw enforcement bureaus. The Office of Inspector General has an \nOversight unit with a current staff of 11 which conducts oversight \nreviews of the four law enforcement bureau's internal investigative \nfunctions, including IRS. In addition, this unit handles most of our \nspecial reviews which result from congressional requests and hotline \ncomplaints. Currently, almost all of that unit's staffing is devoted to \nissues involving IRS.\n    The Treasury OIG's Office of Investigations receives and processes \ncomplaints of alleged misconduct involving employees in each of the \ntwelve Treasury bureaus. The complaints are evaluated by Office of \nInvestigations management officials who initiate appropriate \ninvestigative action.\n    When the Office of Inspector General conducts an investigation, an \ninvestigative report is issued and referred for prosecutive and/or \nadministrative action. The administrative action imposed on Treasury \nemployees is a management decision. The OIG has neither the authority \nnor any influence in determining the extent or the nature of the \nadministrative action imposed on Treasury employees.\n    The OIG Office of Oversight is currently performing a mult bureau \nreview of investigative statistics reported by the four Treasury \nenforcement bureaus. The objective of the review is to assess the \naccuracy of investigative statistics sent to the Inspector General by \nthese bureaus with reference to reports of investigation pending \nmanagement adjudication. The review was structured to determine the \ndependability of reported statistics and, to a limited extent, to \nevaluate the adjudication processes at the enforcement bureaus and to \nidentify possible causes for delay.\n    In dealing with the Internal Revenue Service, this office has \nencountered its share of case-related problems. The Internal Revenue \nService has failed to timely refer complaints to this office, the \nInternal Revenue Service has been slow to take administrative action \nagainst certain IRS employees, and this office has viewed some \nadjudicative actions taken by the IRS as weak decisions.\n    Treasury Directive 40-01, Part I, 5, Duties and Responsibilities of \nHeads of Internal Affairs and Inspection Offices, requires the \nimmediate referral of allegations involving ``senior officials'' and \n``employees of Internal Affairs and Inspection Offices.'' IRS has \nviolated this directive. For example, Inspection referred an allegation \nof possible misconduct by a senior IRS official to the OIG, seven or \nmore months after they received it. In the interim, Inspection \nconducted inquiries allegedly to assess the validity of the allegation \nand determine if a pattern of such conduct existed. As part of that \ninvestigation, Inspection questioned the senior official about the \nemployee's conduct.\n    Another example of the problem was identified during an OIG \ninvestigation of an allegation involving a senior Treasury official. An \nOIG special agent found a note prepared by an IRS senior official. The \nnote showed that two IRS senior officials met with the then-acting \nChief Inspector concerning ``possible/potential attempts to influence \nIRS action'' by a Departmental official. However, no referral was \nreceived by the OIG on this matter.\n    Subsequently, by memorandum dated approximately 16 months later, an \nIRS senior official notified the Chief Inspector of allegations \nregarding possible bribery, graft and conflict of interest involving a \nTreasury official. The allegations were related to the prior referral \nmade to the acting Chief Inspector. Again, no referral was received by \nthe OIG from the IRS. The allegations eventually were reported to the \nOIG. This delay, of over two years, in reporting allegations to the \nOIG, has seriously impacted on the effective and timely resolution of \nthe allegations.\n    These delays by the Office of the Chief Inspector are not only a \ndisservice to the OIG, but are a disservice to the Treasury Department \nand to the public we serve.\n                       access to tax information\n    The Office of Inspector General must provide IRS management with a \n``Notice of Intent'' to access tax information, which must be \nauthorized by IRS, before IRS employees will provide the Office of \nInspector General with tax information. The following is an example of \nthe difficulties that can result from this procedure.\n    As part of our review of the Chief Inspector's investigative \ncoverage, we requested two Reports of Investigation that had not been \nissued. Our request to review both of these reports was initially \nrefused. However, with regard to one of the reports, our efforts to \nreview the report continued for about 30 days, at which time the Chief \nInspector indicated that he would allow us to review the report but we \ncould not make copies.\n    In yet another case, after making arrangements with the Chief \nInspector's personnel to review the report, we were informed that our \ninitial Notice of Intent to Access was not sufficient. Further, we were \ninformed that IRS needed another Notice of Intent if we wanted to \nreview the document. In total, it took 45 days to access the report.\n                         investigative results\n    The OIG Office of Investigations has its 33 criminal investigators \nassigned in six cities to conduct investigations across this country. \nDuring FY 97, with these limited investigative resources, the \nTreasury's OIG Office of Investigations closed a total of 112 cases \nwhich resulted in 7 successful prosecutions, 41 administrative actions \nand the debarment of two contractors. During FY 1995, 1996 and 1997, \nthe Office of Investigations closed a total of 413 cases which resulted \nin 31 successful prosecutions, 158 administrative actions and the \ndebarment/suspension of 9 contractors.\n    During these three fiscal years (1995-1997), the Office of \nInspector General received a total of 846 complaints related to the \nIRS, and initiated 111 cases based on these complaints.\n    We have not been able to conduct needed investigations of all \nsignificant allegations involving IRS officials due to our limited \ninvestigative staff. Consequently, we had to refer several significant \nallegations to the IRS Chief Inspector's Office for investigation. The \nChief Inspector reports back to us on the results of these \ninvestigations.\n                      jennifer long's allegations\n    On October 23, 1997, the Office of Inspector General initiated an \ninvestigation regarding the allegations raised to the Senate Finance \nCommittee by IRS employee Jennifer Long.\n    The OIG reviewed Long's testimony before the Committee and \nsummarized her testimony into eight separate allegations. The OIG \nlimited the scope of its investigation to Long's allegations as they \npertain to the IRS Houston District. Although Long's allegations of IRS \nproblems raised before the Committee were broad in nature, the OIG \nrequested Long to provide specific examples of each allegation. An \ninvestigative report was prepared that examines in detail, the facts \nsurrounding her specific allegations. The information in the report \ncannot be extrapolated to the IRS nationwide.\n    The results of this report relate only to the findings of the \nexamples Long provided to the OIG. For example, the report states that \nthe OIG did not substantiate Long's allegation that IRS Inspection is a \ntool of the District Director. That statement relates to the Houston \nDistrict only. The OIG did not examine that issue in any other IRS \nDistrict. In addition, Long alleged that IRS managers harass and \nretaliate against IRS employees. Although the report does not \nsubstantiate her specific allegations of harassment, it cannot be \nconcluded that IRS managers do not harass or retaliate against \nemployees in the Houston District or in other Districts.\n    During the investigation of the allegations raised by Jennifer \nLong, additional issues were identified which have led to possibly six \nnew cases being opened.\n    As a result of the investigation of Long's allegations, several \nareas of significant concern were noted by the OIG. IRS management \nappears to treat managers differently than employees when it pertains \nto disciplinary action. OIG was advised that IRS managers are allowed \nto ``voluntarily'' step down from their management position rather than \nbeing involuntarily removed. IRS management stated this is done to save \nmoney in case of a lawsuit. An Inspection manager also stated that IRS \nmanagers are punished less severely than IRS employees. This manager \nwas of the opinion it is based on human nature since most managers, to \nhave attained their position, have probably worked well over a long \nperiod of time with little or no prior disciplinary action.\n    Also, if an employee files a grievance, an EEO complaint, or a \nlawsuit against an IRS manager and the employee wins the settlement, \nusually no disciplinary action is taken against the manager for \nallegedly violating the rights of the employee. This process could \nallow managers the freedom to ``harass'' an employee since no action is \ntaken against them. This process could give employees the perception \nthat they cannot take any action against a manager who harasses them or \nretaliates against them.\n    Employees may feel they are retaliated against by management for \nreporting complaints to Inspection. A supervisor, Internal Security, \nHouston, TX, said employees may feel they are routinely ignored after \nproviding the information to Inspection, because the office does not \nnotify the complainant of the action taken by Inspection.\n    Long alleged that Inspection advises IRS management of allegations \nprovided to them, and who provided the information. When employees make \na complaint to Inspection, they usually are not advised whether the \ninformation will be investigated by Inspection or referred to IRS \nmanagement for action. If management addresses the allegation, \nmanagement does not advise Inspection of the action taken regarding the \nemployee's allegation. If an employee complains about a manager to \nInspection and Inspection refers the information to management for \naction, the manager may be advised of the complaint and the \ncomplainant's name. When employees are questioned about their \ncomplaints by management, an employee may feel that the manager will \nretaliate against the employee for complaining. There appears to be \nconfusion on the part of IRS Inspection managers and employees \nregarding the process of providing complainant's names to IRS \nmanagement. Several of the Inspection employees interviewed said the \ncomplainants' names are provided to management, while others indicated \nthe names are not provided to management.\n                               conclusion\n    In summary, although there are serious difficulties we work through \nin performing our investigative mission at the IRS, we believe the \nTreasury Office of Inspector General has performed a significant amount \nof investigative work in response to the September 1997 hearings on the \nIRS.\n    The Office of Inspector General was able to obtain needed \ninvestigative resources from other organizations to meet the \nchallenges. Our efforts have established that there are significant \nconcerns yet to be addressed by the IRS.\n    Thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts with you. I will \nbe happy to answer any questions that you may have."

"","","moynihan","Daniel Patrick Moynihan","    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for this opportunity to appear \nbefore the Committee. I also want to thank you and Senator Moynihan for \nyour leadership in ensuring that our taxpayers are treated fairly and \nreceive quality service.\n    I remember the Chairman's opening statement at my confirmation \nhearing last October. You said that the Congress will remain a \ncommitted and vigilant ally of the American people, and I am grateful \nfor that resolve.\n    We understand that the duty of Congress, and specifically the \nFinance Committee, to exercise its oversight responsibility of the IRS. \nYou must identify problems and weaknesses at the agency. You must \nensure that we are doing our job properly, and when we are not, point \nout the mistakes and suggest remedies to correct them.\n    Mr. Chairman, at my confirmation hearing, I pledged to bring about \nfundamental change at the IRS to improve in the broadest sense the way \nthe agency serves the public. I reaffirm that commitment today.\n    The hearings of the past week further demonstrate that fundamental \nchange at the IRS is needed. I think every American who heard the \ntestimony would be disturbed, and we must change the conditions that \nlead to the kind of situations described by your witnesses. We must \nhelp and better serve taxpayers who comply with their obligations. We \nmust have absolute respect for the rights of all taxpayers. We must \ninsist on fairness and accountability throughout the agency. We must \nhave a quality workplace which provides every employee the positive \nenvironment needed for them to be productive and to provide quality \nservice to taxpayers.\n    As you, Mr. Chairman, and others on the Committee have noted, the \noverwhelming majority of the IRS workforce are honest, hardworking, \ndedicated employees and they are just as upset about allegations of \nmisconduct and mistreatment of taxpayers. After all, we are all \ntaxpayers.\n    And although I am legally prevented from speaking about the \nindividual cases discussed this week, I want to tell the Committee \ntoday that the abuse of even one taxpayer or one employee is one too \nmany. I promise you today that we will investigate every allegation and \ntake appropriate disciplinary action where the allegations are \nsubstantiated.\n    The changes I have proposed will require a dramatic break from past \npractices in every facet of the agency, from internal structure and \ntechnology, management roles and responsibilities to recruitment of \nsenior executives. And I stress that in many cases, this top-to-bottom \nreview of operations and modernization requires the help of outside \nexperts.\n    However, change of this magnitude will take time. There is no magic \nformula that will instantly solve the IRS' problems and transform it \ninto a quality service organization. Fundamental change will require a \ncomprehensive, systematic and sustained approach. We will make \nprogress, Mr. Chairman, but it will be step by step over a period of \nyears. And we must set priorities as to which problems we first turn \nour attention. For example, much as we wish we did not have to, we must \ndo whatever is needed to solve the Century Date Change problem, and \nthis massive problem consumes much management time. And while we are \nchanging the IRS and managing the Century Date change, we must also \noperate the IRS, which even in normal times is a demanding and risky \ntask.\n    Effecting meaningful change at the IRS will require help from the \nCongress, especially the IRS restructuring legislation that the Senate \nwill soon debate. The bill reported out of the Finance Committee \ncontains initiatives that are key to our modernization effort, from \nchanging the organizational structure to establishing an oversight \nboard and expanding and enhancing taxpayers' rights and providing \nessential personnel flexibilities.\n    On a basic level, reform of this magnitude requires a total \nrethinking of the IRS's goals and guiding principles which point the \nway to essential cultural change. The Senate Finance Committee \nlegislation is on target by directing the IRS to revise its mission \nstatement to provide greater emphasis on serving the needs of \ntaxpayers. That service credo must be instilled throughout the agency.\n    In my testimony before this Committee on January 28, 1998, I \narticulated the three goals by which we should measure our success at \nthe IRS: first, service to each taxpayer by making filing easier and \nproviding prompt, professional and helpful treatment to those who may \nowe money; second, service to all taxpayers by ensuring that compliance \nis fair; and third, productivity through a quality work environment.\n    In the same testimony, I also stated the five principles that \nshould guide the operations of the modernized IRS: (1) understanding \nand solving problems from the taxpayer's point of view; (2) expecting \nmanagers to be accountable; (3) using balanced measures of performance; \n(4) fostering open, honest communications; and (5) insisting on total \nintegrity. You may recall the large chart included again as Exhibit 1 \nwhich pointed the future direction of the IRS and which has been widely \ndistributed inside the IRS.\n    This week's hearings directly reinforce the need to integrate these \ngoals and principles throughout the IRS's organization and operations. \nFor example, proper treatment of individual taxpayers means that the \nCriminal Investigation Division must always follow proper procedures \nand be ever mindful of the impact of its investigation techniques on \nthose taxpayers. The goal of a quality work environment clearly \nrequires no toleration of discrimination and one which we give the best \nto each employee so the taxpayers can get the best from each employee.\n    My challenge is to fit all of these pieces together and to \nimplement--not just articulate--the changes needed to make them a \nreality.\n                            law enforcement\n    Mr. Chairman, as part of my ongoing review and systematic study of \nall parts of the IRS, I concluded that a particular approach was needed \nfor the agency's specialized law enforcement operations. Because of \nthese units' special authority and unique characteristics as well as \ntheir importance to the integrity and functioning of the IRS, I \nconcluded it was important to engage the service of some highly \nrespected experts to assist in my efforts.\n    First on my list was how the IRS polices itself. The IRS' \nInspection Service, consisting of Internal Audit and Internal Security, \nperforms a vital role in protecting the agency against external \nattempts to corrupt the tax system or threaten its employees. It is \nalso charged with detecting and deterring fraud and abuse in our \ninternal operations.\n    For example, since FY 1990, the Internal Audit function performed \n64 reviews of criminal investigation activities, and from FY 1995 \nthrough FY 1997, Internal Security investigations resulted in \nadministrative actions against 173 Criminal Investigation Division \nemployees and eight criminal actions.\n    In February 1998, former Comptroller General Charles Bowsher \naccepted my offer to head up an independent review of the Inspection \nService to advise me how it can best perform its essential mission. He \nis being assisted by a staff of experienced auditors and investigators \non detail from agencies outside the IRS. When Mr. Bowsher completes his \nreport, which I expect to receive in June, I will make it public and I \nwill be very much guided by his findings and recommendations.\n    Mr. Bowsher and his team are currently investigating any and all \naspects of the Inspection Service including: (1) a review of the \norganization and methodology used by Inspection to plan and deliver its \naudits and investigations; (2) the relationship between the Inspection \nService and IRS management; and (3) the relationship between the \nInspection Service and Treasury Inspector General. The Senate Finance \nCommittee bill will move most of the Inspection Service to the Treasury \nDepartment--a plan which Secretary Rubin and I both support--in order \nto create greater independence. Mr. Bowsher's report will, \nnevertheless, be quite useful.\n    For example, Mr. Bowsher's interim reports have already indicated \nto me that there is a need to improve the process for investigation and \naction on allegations of misconduct by managers--when those allegations \nfall short of what would be a criminal offense. As indicated in some of \nthe testimony in your hearings, this problem must be addressed.\n    As an interim step, I have set up a special panel of officials from \noutside the IRS to act on possible misconduct cases arising from the \nmisuse of statistics cases that have been under investigation since \nlast fall. This will ensure a fair and objective resolution of these \nimportant cases. The panel has recently received the final \ninvestigational reports on certain cases and has begun its \ndeliberations.\n    Mr. Chairman, in an organization as large and geographically \ndispersed as the IRS, it should some as no surprise that there are \ninstances of inconsistent action with regard to employee discipline.\n    The legislation reported out of your committee strengthens our \nactions by clearly establishing removal from one's position for serious \nmisconduct. While I still have some concerns about how this will be \nadministered, the message is clear. Serious wrongdoings involving \neither a taxpayer or another IRS employee will be dealt with swiftly \nand harshly.\n    In addition, in order to improve the fundamental process, I am \nsetting up a disciplinary task force to ensure that the IRS has \nsufficient processes and procedures in place to identify, evaluate and \ntake consistent and timely action on allegations and complaints against \nIRS employees. It will also ensure that complaints or allegations of \nmisconduct lodged by employees are identified, evaluated and acted upon \nin a consistent and timely fashion. This task force will also be \nadvised by an experienced outside expert.\n    My next action concerned the second major specialized law \nenforcement unit of the IRS is the Criminal Investigation Division. The \nClD's primary mission is to foster voluntary compliance with our tax \nlaws. It plays a vital role by investigating tax evasion, enforcing our \ntax laws in cases of willful non-compliance and ensuring the overall \nfairness of the tax system. Our tax system depends on each taxpayer \nhaving confidence that neighbors or competitors are paying their fair \nshare of taxes. Although our specific measures of non-compliance are \noutdated, the current extrapolations indicate that non-compliance of \nall varieties, commonly known as the ``tax gap,'' now is approximately \n$195 billion/year, which equates to more than $1600-per-year for every \ntax return filed by compliant taxpayers. It is critical that the public \nhave confidence in IRS' ability to fight tax evasion and the CID be \nbeyond reproach.\n    At the direction of Congress, ClD's statutory authority was also \nexpanded to include not only criminal violations of the Internal \nRevenue Code, but also money laundering and currency reporting \nviolations. The CID also has an important role in combating narcotics \ntrafficking.\n    The testimony you heard this week raised questions about whether \nCID is observing taxpayer rights in all instances, and whether \nappropriate investigative techniques are being employed. Given the \nenormous importance of the Criminal Investigation Division to the IRS \nand to the nation, I proposed the following seven-point action plan in \nconjunction with Secretary Rubin and the Treasury Department.\n    One, I launched an independent review of the Criminal \nInvestigations Division that will be headed by former FBI and CIA \nDirector William Webster. Judge Webster's integrity and years of \nexperience in Federal law enforcement make him an ideal candidate for \nthe job. He will be assisted by Mr. Michael Shaheen Jr. and a group of \npersonnel with criminal investigatory and law enforcement experience \nwithin the federal government. Mr. Shaheen is Chief Counsel and Deputy \nExecutive Director of the Commission on the Advancement of Federal Law \nEnforcement. Until recently, he also served as Counsel/Director of the \nOffice of Professional Responsibility of the Department of Justice.\n    Like the independent evaluation of the IRS Inspection Service being \nled by Mr. Bowsher, the CID review is part of my overall strategy to \nassess the full range of IRS operations. This review will examine all \naspects of CID--including operations, procedures, case outcomes, case \nreview practices, discipline, and performance measures for managers and \nemployees.\n    Mr. Chairman, I want to stress that as part of his evaluation, I \nhave asked Judge Webster and his team to examine the cases involving \nthe CID that were brought before the Committee this week.\n    Two, as I mentioned with regard to the Inspection Service, I \nsupport the creation of a new Inspector General for Tax Administration \nat the Treasury Department. Like all Inspectors General, the new IG for \nTax Administration will report directly to Congress and will have the \nindependent authority to investigate all allegations of employee \nmisconduct, including those at the CID.\n    Three, we will centralize the disciplinary process for CID managers \nand employees. To ensure appropriate and consistent discipline in CID \nmisconduct cases, a specified group of labor relations experts will \nreview all such cases and recommend disciplinary actions.\n    Four, we are creating a new complaint system for taxpayers and \nemployees who have complaints about CID investigations. The new \nTreasury IG for Tax Administration will accomplish this task by \nperforming the following functions.\n    The IG will designate officials within the office of the IG for Tax \nAdministration to specialize in Criminal Investigations. They will be \nresponsible for tracking and following up on complaints. The CID \nspecialists will be expected to make prompt initial contact with the \ncomplainant. The CID specialists will also identify problems, recommend \nsolutions, and track the implementation of these solutions. The IG will \nalso publicize its 1-800 number, fax line, and E-mail address to ensure \nthat taxpayers and employees know how to register complaints about the \nCID. It will also work with local Taxpayer Advocates and Citizen \nAdvocacy Panels to help achieve this goal. In addition, the IG will \nestablish clear procedures to ensure that taxpayer and employee \ncomplaints, including anonymous ones, are taken seriously, properly \nreviewed, and kept confidential. Penalties will be established for IRS \nemployees who violate confidentiality.\n    Five, we will institutionalize oversight of CID within Treasury's \nOffice of Enforcement. To the extent permissible by law, the Under \nSecretary for Enforcement will ensure that ClD's policies and \nprocedures are fully consistent with those of Treasury's other law \nenforcement bureaus (Customs, Secret Service, and ATF). The Office of \nEnforcement will conduct periodic reviews to ensure compliance with \npolicies and procedures.\n    Six, I am requesting that the Joint Committee on Taxation join the \nTreasury and the IRS in conducting a study of willful noncompliance. \nThis review will examine the sources and extent of taxpayer \nnoncompliance and measures that might address this problem.\n    Seven, we must promote a culture of openness, quality, and \nintegrity within the CID, consistent with my vision for the entire \nagency. I have issued a directive to all IRS employees about their \nobligation to report misconduct, fraud, waste, and abuse, and to \nguarantee employees freedom from reprisal when they report any \nmisdeeds. The directive will apply, of course, to CID employees, as \nwell as the IRS work force.\n    In addition, as indicated in the testimony of Mr. Burnham and Ms. \nLong, there is no reason whatsoever for IRS statistics on \ninvestigations, prosecutions and convictions to be suspect. We will \nwork with Justice to reconcile our statistics and we will work with \noutside groups to publish the maximum amount of statistical data \npermissible under our disclosure laws.\n    Mr. Chairman, these actions are focused on near-term problems. \nAnother longterm issue is the proper organization and management \nstructure for CID. Judge Webster's review, together with the study \nbeing conducted by Booz Allen, will speak to these larger issues, such \nas the proper structural placement of CID in the modernized IRS. Thus, \nwe will end up with a thorough review and proper and effective \norganization and management of CID, both in the short- and long-term.\n                        work environment issues\n    Mr. Chairman, as a manager with 28 years of experience, I am also \ndeeply troubled and distressed by reports of discrimination and \nharassment in the IRS workplace. I cannot emphasize enough the \nimportance I place on creating a positive working environment free of \nracial discrimination, reprisal and harassment, and a work place that \ninsists on accountability and open and honest communications among \nemployees and management.\n    As I previously stated, one of the three goals for my modernization \nplan is productivity through a quality work environment. It is key to \ncreating an organization that places a premium on service. From my \nexperience, there is a direct relationship between customer service and \nemployee satisfaction. Those companies and organizations that excel in \ncustomer service invariably have employees who feel respected as \nindividuals and valued by management for the contribution they make to \nthe overall service effort.\n    As we seek new ways to work together in a diverse environment, the \nIRS reflects many of the challenges and divisions that our society as a \nwhole faces. In a nationwide organization of more than 100,000 \nemployees, some serious incidents occur. I am committed to addressing \neach and every complaint and I believe the new Inspector General, as \nproposed by the restructuring legislation, will prove to be an \ninvaluable resource in addressing these concerns. In addition, the new \nDisciplinary Action Review Task Force that is conducting a study on the \ncomplaint and disciplinary processes for all IRS operations should also \nprove to be helpful in our efforts to combat discrimination and \nharassment.\n    The employee complaints are also symptomatic of some broader IRS \nmanagement and work environment issues. There are specific stresses \nupon the organization and its work force, such as downsizing, an \narchaic, heavily-layered organizational structure and antiquated \ntechnology. In addition, the IRS' mission is changing from one of pure \ncollection to focusing on taxpayers rights and service. For some, it is \nnot an easy adjustment to make. Our employees are also sensitive to the \npublic criticism of the agency. Most of them had nothing to do with \nmany of the well-publicized cases discussed in these hearings and the \nmedia, but nevertheless, many employees internalize this criticism.\n    Mr. Chairman, there are no quick fixes to these problems, but that \ndoes not diminish my commitment to solving them. Once again, I will \nensure that each of the cases that were presented during this week's \nhearings is examined. I have also recently issued guidelines and \ninformation on specific aspects of these issues. On April 28, 1998, I \nissued a memorandum to all IRS employees stating that they have an \nobligation to report misconduct, fraud, waste and abuse. I made it \nclear that the IRS has a stringent policy that guarantees employees \nfreedom from reprisal when they report such action. IRS employees were \nalso provided with a description of different reporting avenues.\n    On April 29, I issued the new performance standard for executives \nand managers on EEO matters. This new standard comes after consultation \nwith the Departments of Justice and Treasury, and reaffirms our \ncommitment to further progress in eliminating discrimination, promoting \nemployees based on merit and qualifications, and encouraging a diverse \nworkforce and to better the taxpayers.\n    On a broader scale, the modernization process calls for a \nmanagement structure and working environment that will over time create \na more positive working environment. These fundamental changes include:\n          (1) Stronger and direct internal communications; (2) open and \n        direct employee communications with management and the ability \n        of employees to grow to their full potential; (3) a flatter \n        management structure that focuses on broad goals and a team \n        approach; and (4) high-quality and tailored training.\n                     audit selection and execution\n    Mr. Chairman, the final area I want to address is audit selection. \nFirst, I stress that I am new to this area. I am not a CPA or a tax \nattorney; I look at audits much like the average business person does. \nAnd there is a distinct advantage in that perspective in that I will \nnot believe that we are doing things right until I feel I can explain \nit to the average taxpayer.\n    The audit process and our published statistics are terribly \nconfusing and in some cases, frightening for taxpayers. For example, \nhow many taxpayers know the difference between a correspondence audit \nand a field audit? Very few, I would guess. Some taxpayers also believe \nthat they are being audited when they receive a letter from the IRS \ntrying to match a 1099 or W-2 form. Math errors also no longer count as \naudits, when they once did, making historical trends hard to \nunderstand.\n    Once again, it's a classic problem of focus. For too long, the IRS \nexpected taxpayers to understand our terminology and our way of doing \nthings. Mr. Chairman, that business philosophy no longer works. We must \ndemystify the audit process and make it clear that an audit is not a \nsignal that a taxpayer has done anything wrong. An audit should be used \nonly to determine whether taxpayers have paid their correct tax \nliability; audit selection should never be punitive and audits should \nnever be aimed at generating any specific amount of revenue. And all \naudits should be conducted in a thoroughly professional manner.\n    Concerns have also been raised that IRS audits unfairly target the \npoorest taxpayers. This can be broken down into two parts. As shown in \nTable 1, included in audit statistics are two special categories of \nactivities, comprising 45% of what the IRS reported last year as \naudits. One category is audits of taxpayers who filed no return for the \nyear. The second is taxpayers who claimed Earned Income Tax Credits \n(EITC) an area that Congress has asked the IRS to pay special attention \nto because of historically high overclaim rates.\n    For the remaining 55% of audits, which comprise all audits of \nindividual taxpayers who filed returns and did not claim ElTCs, the \nstatistics indicated two important points: One, the chance of a low-\nincome taxpayer being audited is only about 1/2 of 1%, and second, the \nchance of a taxpayer with income over $100,000 being audited is \nactually higher.\n    This set of statistics is a small indicator of the work that needs \nto be done to provide the public a greater understanding of the IRS \ncompliance activities.\n    Audit coverage also varies from district to district. This is \npartly because incomes and compliance vary widely; the population is \nnot homogeneous from district to district. To be fair and efficient, we \nmust audit taxpayer returns that have the greatest probability of \nerror, and they are not uniformly distributed in each district. For \nexample, the eight districts with the consistently highest audit rates \nhad a much larger concentration of business returns than those with low \naudit rates--7.6 percent of the returns filed versus 5.6 percent. \nStudies also show that taxpayers tend to be less accurate in reporting \ntheir business income-typically due to the absence of third party \ninformation reporting--than in reporting wages, interest, dividends and \npension. With respect to conduct of individual audits, proper \nsupervision--in which quality standards are the paramount concern--is \nof the utmost importance. As with all areas of the IRS, the role of the \nindependent IG in investigating any instance of improper influence on \nan audit, is essential.\n    I am convinced that the long-term solution to many audit concerns \nlies in the IRS modernization concept that I have advanced. It will \nallow better management of compliance resources on a nationwide basis. \nIts customer focus will stress preventing problems before they occur, \nsuch as EITC Awareness Days and Problem Prevention Days. Proper \nmeasurement which focus on quality and the taxpayers' viewpoint will be \nan essential element.\n    This reorganization, which would streamline the IRS' complex \nstructure, would allow for a better explanation of how we allocate our \nresources, in terms of activities, personnel and location. Moreover, by \ndesigning the IRS around taxpayer groups, we would have a much better \nmechanisms for managing and controlling compliance activities. I pledge \nto the Committee that in designing the new organization, we will place \ngreat emphasis on the control over audit selection.\n                               conclusion\n    Mr. Chairman, last October, I commented that the renewed interest \nof the Congress in IRS management issues is an essential force for \npositive change. Six months later, I still firmly believe that.\n    The first round of Senate Finance Committee hearings produced \npositive results for taxpayers, as I hope these will. The IRS stopped \nthe practice of ranking the 33 districts on enforcement results. We \nprohibited the use of enforcement results to evaluate employees. We \nestablished new procedures requiring a higher level of approval for \nseizure of property for non-payment of taxes to ensure that collection \nenforcement tools, such as seizures are only used in appropriate cases. \nWe spent over 8,600 staff days and $3.4 million investigating and \nauditing the use of enforcement statistics in collections.\n    We also put more muscle behind the Taxpayer Advocate's \nrecommendations to IRS functions. There is now a new authority to \nmandate that administrative or procedural changes requested by the \nAdvocate be implemented.\n    We also created the new Taxpayer Treatment and Service Improvements \nProgram to implement the hundreds of recommendations that will improve \nour treatment of taxpayers and the service we provide them. I stress \nagain that appropriate disciplinary action will be taken if allegations \nof misconduct and mistreatment prove true.\n    Since the September hearings, the IRS has also created a number of \ninitiatives to improve taxpayer service and help taxpayers comply with \nthe law. Last November, we began hosting monthly Problem Solving Days \nwhich did not end with the conclusion of filing season but will \ncontinue to be offered across the country to help taxpayers clear up \nlongstanding tax problems.\n    As part of our Saturday Service Days, we also hosted Problem \nPrevention Days--keeping with my commitment to assist taxpayers in \npreventing problems--and sponsored an Earned Income Tax Credit \nAwareness Day to help taxpayers determine if they are eligible for the \ncredit and then show them the correct way to fill out the tax return.\n    Mr. Chairman, I realize that these are small, first steps \naddressing some very large problems. Much more needs to be done, and \nwill be done. Fundamentally changing the way the IRS does business is a \nlong-term process requiring a long-term commitment from both the \nCongress and the IRS. I am here again today to pledge myself to that \ngoal and to our partnership. Thank you."

break,break,break,break
"","","moynihan","Daniel Patrick Moynihan","    WASHINGTON--Commissioner Charles O. Rossotti today announced a \nseven-point plan to improve the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal \nInvestigation Division (CID).\n    ``This is part of my long-term commitment to effect fundamental \nchange at the IRS--to ensure fairness of treatment and give the \nAmerican people the quality service they deserve,'' Rossotti said.\n    The seven-point action plan is part of an ongoing assessment of IRS \nactivities that Rossotti began when he assumed office in November 1997. \nIn February, Rossotti appointed former Comptroller General Charles \nBowsher to head an independent review of the IRS Inspection Service. In \nMarch, he created a special program to implement the hundreds of \nrecommendations to improve the IRS's treatment of taxpayers and the \nservice it provides them.\n    In recent months, concerns have been raised about the activities of \nCID. ``The Criminal Investigation Division of the IRS plays a pivital \nrole in fighting tax evasion, and it is critical that its operations be \nbeyond reproach,'' Rossotti said. ``We must address these concerns in a \nthorough, fair and objective fashion.''\n    ``I fully support Commissioner Rossotti's efforts to take \naggressive actions to improve the Criminal Investigation Division at \nthe IRS,'' said Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. ``These steps will \nincrease accountability and openness at the IRS and are a part of our \ncontinuing commitment to delivering to the American people the IRS they \ndeserve  an agency that respects taxpayer rights while collecting the \nrevenue due.''\n    The plan the IRS announced today is attached."

break,break,break,break
"","","moynihan","Daniel Patrick Moynihan","    1. Launch an independent review of the Criminal Investigation \nDivision (CID). This effort will be led by an expert in federal law \nenforcement. Like the independent evaluation of the IRS Inspection \nService being led by Charles Bowsher, the former head of the GAO, the \nCID review is part of the Commissioner's overall strategy to review the \nfull range of IRS operations. This review will examine all aspects of \nCID- including operations, procedures, case outcomes, case review \npractices, discipline, and performance measures for managers and \nemployees.\n    2. Support the creation of a new Inspector General for Tax \nAdministration at the Treasury Department. Like all Inspectors General \n(IG), the new IG for Tax Administration will report directly to \nCongress and will have the independent authority to investigate all \nallegations of employee misconduct, including abuse of force and Equal \nEmployment Opportunity (EEO) complaints.\n    3. Centralize the disciplinary process for CID managers and \nemployees. To ensure appropriate and consistent discipline in CID \nmisconduct cases, a specified group of labor relations experts will \nreview all CID misconduct cases and recommend disciplinary actions. In \naddition, Commissioner Rossotti has requested that a new Disciplinary \nAction Review Task Force conduct a study on the complaint and \ndisciplinary processes across the entire IRS. This study will be \nconducted with the assistance of a qualified outside expert.\n    4. Create a new complaint system. The new Disciplinary Action \nReview Task Force will closely examine all types of complaints and \ntheir tracking systems across the IRS, including CID. In addition, the \nnew Treasury IG for Tax Administration will:\n  <bullet> Designate officials within the office of the IG for Tax \n        Administration to specialize in Criminal Investigations. \n        Specialists. who will have a background in law enforcement but \n        cannot be former CID employees. will be responsible for \n        tracking and following up on complaints The CID specialists \n        will be expected to make initial contact with the complainant \n        within three business days of receiving the complaint\n  <bullet> Identify systemic problems within CID. The CID specialists \n        will monitor all databases containing information on special \n        agent performance to identify trends and systemic problems \n        recommend solutions, and track the implementation of those \n        solutions.\n  <bullet> Publicize the IG's 1-800 number, fax line and E-mail address \n        to ensure that taxpayers and employees are aware of how to \n        register complaints about CID. Work with local Taxpayer \n        Advocates and Citizen Advocacy Panels to help achieve this \n        goal.\n  <bullet> Establish clear procedures to ensure that taxpayer and \n        employee complaints, including anonymous ones, are taken \n        seriously, properly reviewed, and kept confidential. Penalties \n        will be established for IRS employees who violate \n        confidentiality.\n    5. Institutionalize oversight of CID within Treasury's Office of \nEnforcement. To the extent permissible by law, the Under Secretary for \nEnforcement will ensure that ClD's policies and procedures are fully \nconsistent with those of Treasury's other law enforcement bureaus \n(Customs, Secret Service, and ATF). The Office of Enforcement will \nconduct periodic reviews to ensure compliance with those policies and \nprocedures.\n    6. Request that the Joint Committee on Taxation join the Treasury \nand the IRS in conducting a study of willful noncompliance. This review \nwill examine the sources and extent of taxpayer noncompliance and \nmeasures that might address this problem.\n    7. Promote a culture of openness, quality, and integrity within \nCID, consistent with Commissioner Rossotti's vision for the entire \nacency:\n  <bullet> Commissioner Rossotti has issued a directive to all IRS \n        employees about their obligation to report misconduct, fraud, \n        waste, and abuse, and to guarantee employees freedom from \n        reprisal when they report any misdoings. The directive will \n        apply to CID employees, as well as all other IRS employees.\n  <bullet> Education and training programs will provide detailed \n        information to employees and managers--including within CID--on \n        whistleblower policies, procedures and protections.\n                             Communications"

"","","moynihan","Daniel Patrick Moynihan","    Mr. Chairman and Honorable Members of this Committee. I present \nthis information to you in the hopes that corrective laws and measures \nwould be instituted regarding the IRS that would prevent what happened \nto me from occurring to anyone else.\n    I would like to present the attached letter to District Director of \nIRS, Jack Cheskaty as evidence of my treatment by the IRS.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\1\\ Letters and attached tax forms were retained in the committee \nfiles.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    As you can see the IRS has manufactured bogus liens and spent \nalmost eight years trying to collect over $1,600,000 from me.\n    Following this letter and the increased pressure being applied by \nCongress, the IRS wrote me on March 4, 1998 that, ``The taxes for '83-\n'87 should have been discharged in your Chapter 7 Bankruptcy proceeding \nthat was concluded on February 3, 1993,'' and ``We apologize for the \ninconvenience this matter has caused you.'' No response to the fact \nthat I never owed the taxes dismissed.\n    I certainly believe that without Congress' investigation into the \nInternal Revenue Service this bogus tax lien would still be enforced \nagainst me. Therefore I thank you and others in Congress for your \nefforts as this is finally put behind me.\n    I would like to propose the following legislative changes:\n          1. The IRS must serve in person any assessment notice on the \n        taxpayer and not just mail it out to any address they deem \n        appropriate.\n          2. Any taxpayer should have the right to have a court set \n        aside a lien while the merit of the lien is being pursued not \n        as it currently is. The taxpayer paying off the lien and then \n        suing the IRS for incorrect seizures.\n          3. The IRS is mandated to adhere to present Bankruptcy Laws \n        and Orders of Discharge, not just continue to collect as they \n        have been doing.\n          4. Financial compensation should be available to the taxpayer \n        for actions taken by the IRS and any law should be retroactive \n        at least ten years. The basis of 10 years should be applied as \n        that is the current amount of time the IRS has to collect from \n        the taxpayer. This should now be reduced to 6 years.\n          5. Errors and emissions insurance should be required for all \n        IRS employees which would allow for compensation to the \n        taxpayer for wrongful actions taken by the IRS. Agents without \n        insurance would be terminated.\n          6. The taxpayer can record any meeting with IRS employees.\n          7. Internal Revenue employees should be fired for their \n        wrongful actions."

The IRS has demonstrated its ability to overpower its \noverseers by instilling fear of retaliation. Over the years, the IRS \nhas investigated members of Congress who held hearings concerning IRS \nabuses, leaked information to the press to damage reelection bids of \ncongressmen that were openly critical of the agency, investigated the \nPresident of the United States, and remarkably, in one case, initiated \nan investigation of a congressman that led to his wrongful \n    In 1924, Senator James Couzens, chairman of a committee charged \nwith investigating the Bureau of Internal Revenue, was approached while \nleaving the Senate floor by Bureau Commissioner Blair with notice that \nhe was being assessed $10,861,131.50 in back taxes. Couzens continued \nhis investigation despite the apparent retaliation and later was \nawarded a refund of $989,883 for his overpayment of taxes by the Board \nplan to hold hearings on the agency's performance. Shortly after his \nannouncement, the IRS launched an investigation against Senator \nMontoya. Commissioner Donald C. Alexander eventually canceled the \ninvestigation. Nevertheless, a leak to the press that the agency had \nbegun to investigate the Senator, contributed to Montoya's defeat at \nquestion President Nixon's tax records. This led to an investigation of \nhis 1969 to 1972 tax returns, the results of which became a factor in \nNixon's resignation in August of 1974. The investigation concluded that \nNixon owed a total of $432,787.13 in back taxes for the years in \n    Another example of retaliation against oversight is the story of \nCongressman George Hansen. Hansen, an outspoken critic of IRS abuses, \nnarrowly won his 1976 reelection bid after his political opposition \ncharged that irregularities appeared in his tax history. After criminal \nproceedings over three years, the IRS found no wrongdoing and issued \nhim a $10,000 refund. But, this was not the end of Hansen's troubles \nwith the agency. The Congressman remained an outspoken critic of the \nIRS, and, in 1980, published an expose called To Harass Our People: The \nIRS and Government Abuse of Power. In 1984, in another apparent case of \nretaliation, the Congressman was charged with and convicted of one \ncount of ``Willful Failure to File'' under 18 U.S.C. 1001 for the \ncontent of filings under the Ethics in Government Act and fined \n$40,000. He served out this conviction by spending four years in \nfederal prison over a ten-year time span. Surprisingly, George Hansen \nwas the only congressman ever prosecuted under this law. In 1995, the \nSupreme Court declared his conviction a wrongful prosecution and \nsummarily vacated the ruling against him. His $40,000 was returned but \nthe ten years of legal fees and loss of income was financially \n    Recommendations. These examples show that the agency's extensive \npowers of investigation can be used to attempt to suppress oversight. \nTax historian Charles Adams, in his book For Good and Evil: The Impact \nof Taxes on the Course of Civilization, recommends making Congress and \nrecommendation. Additionally, all congressional staff level employees \nworking on IRS oversight committees--the President, the Vice President, \nand all others in position of IRS oversight or governance--should be \nimmune from the agency. However, these individuals must still file tax \nreturns. Thus, Congress will need to establish an alternate system of \nfiling tax returns for those declared immune from IRS examination \npowers.\n                   ii. due process and trial by jury\n    Background. Tax laws and regulations have been written that deny \ntaxpayers due process. The Fifth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution declares that in criminal cases the accused will not ``be \ndeprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,'' \nand the Sixth Amendment declares that ``In all criminal prosecutions \nthe accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an \nimpartial jury.to be informed of the nature and cause of the \naccusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have \ncompulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor; and to have \nthe assistance of counsel for his defense.''\n    Nonetheless, the IRS deprives taxpayers of property by pursuing \nseizure of assets under civil, not criminal actions, thereby avoiding \nthe letter of the Fifth Amendment due process clause and the Sixth \nAmendment right to trial by jury. Additionally, the provision in the \nSeventh Amendment for jury trials in common law civil cases is likewise \ntreated as non-applicable since the Tax Code is statutory law, not \ncommon law. The result is the IRS seizes property, shuts down \nbusinesses, or levies bank accounts without granting taxpayers a trial \nat all.\n    Recommendations. Lawmakers should draft legislation granting \ntaxpayers a right to trial by jury where a home, business, means of \ntransportation, bank account, or any other asset over a certain dollar \nvalue (to be set by Congress) has been tagged for seizure. Trial by \njury mitigates the injustice and conflict of interest where the \ngovernment is both plaintiff and judge in matters involving the seizure \nof taxpayers' assets. In such matters, a jury could confirm the \nlegitimacy of actions taken by government, thus strengthening the \ngovernment's position, or it could act to protect taxpayers against \ncollection actions considered too harsh by the jury. Eventually, \nlawmakers will need to amend the Constitution to include a specific \ndeclaration of the right to trial by jury in property seizure cases \nprosecuted under civil statutory law.\n    Also, the main factor determining the applicable standard of \njustice in a tax case, civil or criminal, is the judgment of the \nrevenue agent. This situation leads to different and arbitrary \nstandards of treatment. Charles Adams recommends decriminalizing the \nTax Code in order to establish one civil standard of law enforcement \nfor tax crimes. His suggestion is buttressed by words of the great \nwriters, William Blackstone, and Adam Smith. They wrote that tax \nevasion is a natural response to excessive taxation, and that \ngovernments should not resort to excessive punishments by making \ncapital offenses of common crimes\n                     iii. personal recommendations\n    A. Taxpayer Protection Agency. Congress should codify legislation \nthat creates an independent body called the Taxpayer Protection Agency. \nThis new agency should be placed under Legislative Branch management, \nnot under Treasury or Executive Branch control. The Taxpayer Protection \nAgency would provide checks and balances against efforts by the IRS to \nenforce the Tax Code. It should not be under Treasury management \nbecause the Treasury could conceivably benefit financially from \noverlooking IRS abuse of taxpayers. Although under Legislative Branch \ncontrol, it could still provide regular reports and recommendations to \nboth the President and Congress. Moreover, like all other IRS \noverseers, employees of this new agency should file tax returns to \nJudicial Branch auditors, not to the IRS.\n    The independence of the Taxpayer Protection Agency from Executive \nBranch management guarantees its effectiveness. An example of the \nimportance of independence in oversight is the Office of the \nComptroller of the Currency's (OCC) relationship with private banking \ninstitutions. The OCC, a Treasury Department bureau that is entirely \nindependent of private banks, regularly audits banking institutions' \ndebt collection practices to ensure compliance with consumer protection \nstatutes. If the Department of the Treasury does not trust private \nbanks to police their own debt collection practices, then the \nDepartment of the Treasury should not be trusted to solely police its \nown collections agency, the IRS. The Taxpayer Protection Agency as \nproposed would be independent of the Treasury chain of command, and \ntherefore, would guarantee taxpayers effective, independent oversight \nof the IRS.\n    B. Political misuse. If anyone within the IRS seeks to audit any \npolitical or religious group, whether it be tax-exempt or not, the \nagent or management official seeking the audit should first submit a \nrequest to the independent Taxpayer Protection Agency. This proposed \nagency would then track all requests, have approval authority over such \nrequests, and track the conclusion of all approved audits. Congress \nwould receive regular statistical reports on these audits. Furthermore, \nthe Taxpayer Protection Agency should have power to discipline agents \nor executives found to have political agendas in their selection of \naudits.\n    C. Secrecy and accounting. Congress should grant the Taxpayer \nProtection Agency full immunity from the taxpayer privacy restrictions \nfound in the Tax Code, section 6103. Furthermore, this new agency \nshould be given authority to review all IRS internal documents. All \nrequests for information such as freedom of information requests should \nbe submitted to the Taxpayer Protection Agency for review of taxpayer \nprivacy concerns and monitoring of the agency's timeliness in meeting \napproved requests. Standards should be set for the handling and \nretention of documents to be enforced by the Taxpayer Protection \nAgency, and the General Accounting Office should be staffed with \naccounting specialists whose sole responsibility is the ongoing review \nof and assistance in producing IRS financial reports and budget \nrequests.\n    D. Enemies Lists. Congress should enact legislation that would make \nit illegal for the IRS to label taxpayers based upon their political \nviews or to keep lists of taxpayers based upon such information. Also, \nlawmakers should establish penalties against individuals found to have \nviolated such a law. For enforcement purposes, Congress should charge \nthe independent Taxpayer Protection Agency with the responsibility to \ninvestigate and punish this type of activity.\n    E. Taxpayer Advocacy. The legislature should make the Office of \nshould make this change by creating an advocacy office within the \nindependent Taxpayer Protection Agency. This new agency would use its \nauthority to view all taxpayer confidential data to quickly assist \ntaxpayers with their problems. Also, it would work closely with IRS \nmanagement to resolve taxpayers' concerns.\n    F. Inspection Service. Having the Department of the Treasury solely \npolice the IRS is a conflict of interest. The Treasury may benefit \nfinancially from overlooking IRS abuse of taxpayers. Therefore, the \nTreasury should not be solely responsible for policing the agency. In \norder to establish independent and more objective external policing of \nthe IRS, Congress should move the twelve hundred member IRS Inspection \nService to the proposed Taxpayer Protection Agency. The Office of \nInspector General should remain under Treasury control; however, two \nthirds of its staff should move to the Taxpayer Protection Agency as \nwell. Inspectors that move from Treasury management to this new agency \nwould retain their current responsibilities until the new agency \ndetermines if a reallocation of responsibilities will take place. The \nremaining one hundred inspectors working in the Office of Inspector \nGeneral should remain available to Treasury management for \ninvestigations of broad organizational concerns.\n    G. Performance measures. The IRS should establish quality of work \nand efficiency standards, and monitor quality of performance. In \naddition to management monitoring, Congress should provide resources to \nthe Taxpayer Protection Agency for monitoring live collection calls and \naudits, and for joint monitoring with management. Employees should be \nheld accountable to their performance on these audits.\n    The Internal Revenue Service has already taken steps to halt the \nimproper use of statistics in employee evaluations. Lawmakers should \nguard against the resurfacing of this problem by passing legislation \nthat prohibits Congress or the IRS from establishing any organization-\nwide dollar goal under the Government Performance and Reporting Act of \n1993. The IRS should be held to the goal that assessments are to be \nmade for the amount the law requires--no more, no less.\n    H. Penalties and interest. Too many penalties exist in the Tax \nCode. Lawmakers should vastly reduce the number of penalties present in \nthe Code. A reduction would improve the tax complexity problem and \nwould support the IRS's policy that penalties are applied to encourage \ncompliance, not to raise revenues.\n    In the credit card industry, the law requires creditors to present \na bill showing the amount due prior to assessing interest and/or \npenalties to debtors. Although it should, this standard does not apply \nto federal tax collections. Often, the amount of interest that \ntaxpayers are required to pay varies greatly depending upon the time it \ntakes the IRS to identify and notify taxpayers of the amount that is \nowed in back taxes. This practice is too arbitrary. As in the private \nsector, it should be illegal to assess interest charges for the period \nbetween the occurrence of an error and notification of the amount due.\n    Finally, the IRS is not in the banking business; the agency \ncollects taxes. Congress should place a percentage cap on the total \nincrease that can be added to an assessed underpayment of taxes. In \nAncient Israel, the penalty for false swearing was 20 percent. \nIsraelites were required to pay the value of whatever was sworn falsely \ngood standard for capping the assessment of interest and penalties. For \ninstance, a taxpayer is hypothetically assessed $200,000 dollars for an \nunderpayment of taxes. Applying the rule of 20 percent, this taxpayer's \ntotal tax bill from the assessment could never exceed $240,000. This \nrule would eliminate the horror stories of tax bills growing \nexponentially until they drive taxpayers into bankruptcy or financial \ndestitution and would retain the agency's ability to assess penalties \nand interest as a means to encourage accurate and timely compliance.\n    I. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Bible contains words that apply \nto the issue of fair tax assessment. First, in the Gospel of Luke, tax \ncollectors approached Jesus with a question. Luke 3:12-13 reads, ``And \nsome tax-gatherers also came to be baptized, and they said to him, \n`Teacher, what shall we do?' And he said to them, `Collect no more than \nwhat you have been ordered to.' '' Second, Proverbs 20:10 reads, \n``Differing weights and differing measures, both of them are abominable \nto the Lord.'' The practice of inflating income and assessment, by \nwhatever means, violates these time-honored principles found in \nScripture. Congress should bar the use of statistically generated \naverage expenses to inflate taxpayer income in all cases, except \nperhaps where a taxpayer refuses to file a tax return altogether.\n    J. Extensions and waivers. H.R. 2676 requires the agency to provide \nnotice to taxpayers of their right to refuse signing a waiver of the \nstatute of limitations. Providing notice is not enough protection. \nCongress should completely bar this and any other practice involving \nthe waiver of taxpayer rights.\n    K. Whipsaw Technique. The whipsaw technique is the seizure of \nproperty belonging to a third party to a tax dispute, issuance of \nnominee liens (liens against a third party without prior notification), \nor the levying of a third party's paycheck. This tactic is usually \nemployed when an IRS agent has reason to believe a third party is \nprotecting assets for a delinquent taxpayer or assets were transferred \nfor less than fair consideration. However, David Patnoe, a former \nrevenue officer and current representative of taxpayers before the \nCollections Division, testified that he represented taxpayers in cases \n    On its face, this practice clearly violates a basic tenet of \ncontract law. Under contract law, individuals are not liable for \ncontracts to which they are not a party. Before taking action against \nthird parties, the government should have to prove in Tax Court the \nvalidity of such actions and third parties should enjoy the due process \nright of trial by jury. Otherwise, the Fair Debt Collection Practices \nAct (FDCPA) forbids creditors collecting on delinquent accounts on \nbehalf of another party from demanding payment of third parties in an \neffort to collect debts. FDCPA does not apply to the IRS because the \nagency collects its own delinquent accounts. However, Congress should \ndraft legislation that directs the IRS to fully comply with all third-\nparty provisions in the Fair Debts Collection Practices Act. Likewise, \nthe courts should recognize the rights of third parties to a delinquent \ndebt specified in this act. Like the adopted provision from the \nRepublican Contract With America that declares Congress should not be \nexempt from the laws it has passed, so should the IRS not be exempt \nfrom existing standards enacted by Congress that apply to private \nbanking institutions' debt collection practices.\n    L. Other recommendations. The Taxpayer Protection Agency should \nmonitor the sale of seized assets to ensure that the IRS receives the \nminimum bid required before selling seized property. Moreover, certain \nprotocols exist within the IRS for a revenue agent to obtain \nauthorization to use a pseudonym. However, the Senate Finance Committee \nheard testimony that these protocols are being loosely followed. The \nresult is, at times, taxpayers are unable to get in contact with agents \nwho are handling their cases or they are unable to find and report \nabusive revenue officers. Therefore, Congress should forbid the use of \npseudonyms by revenue officers and should require agent names to be on \nall written correspondence with taxpayers. Also, legislators should \nestablish maximum allowable length of audits for four distinct \nentities: small businesses, large corporations, tax exempt \norganizations, and single or joint filers. Beyond the prescribed \nmaximums set by Congress, investigations should cease and desist. \nFurthermore, any regulation written by the Internal Revenue Service or \nchange in the Internal Revenue Manual should be approved by Congress \nprior to implementation.\n              iv. response to roth amendments to h.r. 2676\n    On March 25, 1998, Senator Roth, Chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, issued a press release with recommendations to alter H.R. \nconsistent with the recommendations and findings of this study and \nshould be adopted by the Senate. Specifically, Congress should adopt \nbanding of pay scales and bonus compensation plans for cost-saving, \ninnovative ideas. Also, Congress should adopt proportionate liability \nfor joint filers and the provisions for automatic termination of IRS \nemployees where employees have committed perjury, assault and battery, \nfraudulent destruction of documents to hide wrongdoing, or violations \nof policies or procedures for the purpose of harming another. However, \nthere are a few items that could be improved.\n    First, giving the Oversight Board ``big picture'' authority over \nlaw enforcement and collection activities will negate the Board's \nobjectivity over time. Instead, the Oversight Board should be a review \nboard only. Second, Senator Roth's proposal to make the Office of \nTaxpayer Advocate ``more'' independent of IRS management does not go \nfar enough to ensure taxpayers get fair and objective assistance. \nCongress should make this Office completely independent of the Treasury \nchain of command.\n    Third, transferring IRS Internal Security and portions of Internal \nAudit to the Treasury Office of Inspector General will not cure the \nInternal Revenue Service's self-policing ills. In the current \nenvironment, Internal Security is already under Treasury management \nsince the IRS is a Treasury branch agency. Therefore, moving the \nInspection Service so that it reports directly to the Office of \nInspector General is not a significant change. Furthermore, having the \nDepartment of the Treasury solely police the IRS is a conflict of \ninterest. The Treasury may benefit financially from overlooking IRS \nabuse of taxpayers. Therefore, the Treasury should not be solely \nresponsible for policing the agency. Fourth, following this logic, the \nTreasury Inspector General should not be solely responsible for \ntracking and reporting the status of taxpayer complaints; nor should \nthe Inspector General be ultimately responsible for monitoring the use \nof statistics in performance measures or ensuring that taxpayer rights \nare not being violated. These types of policing responsibilities should \nreside in an agency that reports directly to the Legislative Branch, \nnot to the Department of the Treasury.\n    Fifth, making the burden of proof in tax court rest on the IRS when \nthe agency uses Bureau of Labor statistics to determine a taxpayer's \nincome would be an improvement. However, greater steps should be taken \nto protect the taxpayer from being assigned income unfairly by the IRS. \nThe practice of using Department of Labor statistics to determine \nincome should be discarded entirely, except perhaps where the taxpayer \nrefuses to file a return altogether. Sixth, the provision to allow \ncivil damages for unauthorized collection actions against third parties \nfalls well short of the standard established in the Fair Debt \nCollection Practices Act. In this act, collection actions against \nanyone other than the debtor are illegal. This standard should also \napply to collection of federal taxes. If an agent of the government \nfeels a third party is unfairly sheltering assets for a delinquent \ntaxpayer, the government should have to prove its case before a judge \nand jury.\n    And lastly, the provision calling for the suspension of interest \nand penalties on delinquent taxes after one year if by that time the \nIRS has not brought the matter to the taxpayer's attention, does not \nsufficiently protect taxpayers. Senator Christopher Bond (R-Missouri) \nsponsored Senate Bill S. 1669, which has language that comes closest to \nthe private sector standard that interest should not accrue on the \namount due until notice is given of the amount owed. Congress should \n          v. author's recommended new taxpayer bill of rights\n    Congress should draft a new taxpayer bill of rights that includes \nthe following provisions:\n          1. Taxpayers have a right to know that the Internal Revenue \n        Service cannot intimidate overseers of the agency from \n        performing their oversight responsibilities through retaliatory \n        audits or the threat thereof. All members of the Executive, \n        Congressional, and Judicial Branches involved in oversight of \n        federal income tax collections should be immune from \n        accountability to the IRS. If this policy is adopted, lawmakers \n        will need to arrange an alternate system for processing these \n        members' tax returns.\n          2. Taxpayers have a right to independent policing of the IRS. \n        Congress should move the twelve hundred member IRS Inspection \n        Service and two thirds of the three hundred member Office of \n        Inspector General--along with Office of Taxpayer Advocate--\n        under the control of a new, independent organization to be \n        established by Congress called the Taxpayer Protection Agency. \n        This agency should report directly to the Legislative Branch of \n        government, not to the Department of the Treasury. It should \n        investigate taxpayer complaints, conduct investigations of IRS \n        personnel, monitor the quality of work done by IRS agents, and \n        provide regular reports to Congress.\n          3. Taxpayers have a right to a Tax Code that is simple and \n        clear to understand, is not arbitrary as to the amount to be \n        paid, is enforceable without the employment of an army of tax \n        collectors whose salaries consume a large part of public \n        revenues, and is not so intrusive as to require frequent \n        examinations. Congress should not fashion it with many \n        penalties and exorbitant interest rates so that delinquent \n        taxpayers cannot satisfy outstanding tax debts amicably, or \n        with many loopholes and special provisions so that marginal tax \n        rates must be excessively high on taxpayers not benefiting from \n        such provisions. Also, it should be progressive in that it \n        excludes the impoverished from paying the tax and fair in that \n        it treats various classes of taxpayers equally.\n          4. Taxpayers have a right to a cap on the total amount of \n        additional tax that the IRS can legally place on a delinquent \n        tax debt through penalties and interest or by any other means.\n          5. Taxpayer's due process rights should include a right to a \n        trial by jury in all cases where a home, business, means of \n        transportation, bank account, or any other asset over a certain \n        dollar value (to be set by Congress) is to be seized. An \n        amendment to the Constitution guaranteeing this right should be \n        submitted to all fifty states for ratification.\n          6. Taxpayers have a right to restitution for all expenses \n        incurred, including lost wages, when the government falsely \n        accuses the taxpayer, is negligent in its collection practices, \n        or acts in violation of the law.\n          7. Taxpayers have a right to equal justice under the law. \n        Criminal charges are filed against delinquent taxpayers quite \n        arbitrarily, and in more than half of the Internal Revenue \n        Service's criminal cases, charges filed by the agency were for \n        matters that could have been handled by other government \n        agencies. Legislators should establish one standard of justice \n        in tax matters by decriminalizing the Tax Code. This change \n        will ensure that all classes of taxpayers are treated equally.\n          8. Taxpayers have a right to know that the IRS rates tax \n        collectors based on their ability to determine the correct \n        amount due, not based upon statistics, such as dollars \n        collected or total number of properties seized.\n          9. Taxpayers have a right to know the basis in the Tax Code \n        for the disallowance of deductions or increase of income. The \n        Internal Revenue Service should bear the burden of proving the \n        validity of any disallowance or increase in court. Bureau of \n        Labor statistics should never be considered adequate proof, \n        except perhaps in cases where the taxpayer refuses to file a \n        tax return altogether.\n          10. Taxpayers have a right not to be asked to waive their \n        rights.\n                                endnotes\n(visited 10 December 1997) <http://www.techmgmt.com/restore/hensen.htm>\n(New York: Random House, 1989). 291-294.\nInquiry, Book III, 93rd Cong., 2nd sees., 20 June-23 July 1974, 2242.\nCourse of Civilization (New York: Madison Books, 1993), 466-467.\nProcedures of the Internal Revenue Service, 105th Cong., 1st sess., 23, \n24, and 25 September 1997, 103 (testimony of Thomas Savage).\nProposal the ``Most Comprehensive Overhaul of the IRS Ever Proposed,'' \nPress Release No. 105-274, 25 March 1998, <http://www.senate.gov/\n<difference>finance/105-274.htm>.\n105th Cong., 2nd sees., S. 1669, Congressional Record, vol. 144, daily \ned.

"","","moynihan","Daniel Patrick Moynihan","    The following case is respectfully submitted for inclusion in the \nrecord of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee's IRS Oversight Hearings of \nApril 28, 29 and May 1,1998. We bring to your attention the religious \npersecution case of Pastor Tony Alamo (Bernie LaZar Hoffman). Pastor \nAlamo was the subject of a twenty-year IRS investigation that violated \nhis First Amendment rights and his rights to due process under the law.\n    In June of 1994, Pastor Tony Alamo was wrongly convicted of filing \na fraudulent income tax return for 1985 in violation of 26 U.S.C. 7206 \n(count one) and failing to file income tax returns for years 1986 \nthrough 1988 (counts two through four), in violation of 26 U.S.C. 7203. \nHe was sentenced to an unduly harsh six-year prison sentence, which \nwill end in December 1998.\n    Recently released Freedom of Information Act documents (described \nlater in this statement), however, expose that Mr. Alamo, pastor of \nAlamo Christian Ministries and the Music Square Church (MSC), was the \nvictim of improper conduct by IRS investigators who went to great \nextremes to secure a conviction against him. New evidence proves that \nthe IRS lied to the jury, withheld information and pertinent \ndocumentation from the defense, intimidated witnesses, and relied on \nunreliable witnesses and anti-religious organizations who had ulterior \nmotives and used the IRS, a supposed neutral government agency, for \ntheir own ends. In addition, the IRS staged an unnecessary armed raid \non church members, all citizens of this country, who were neither \ndangerous nor violent and did not possess arms.\n    IRS unconstitutionally ``determined'' that Pastor Alamo's church \nwas illegitimate, and took away its tax exemption; and then set out to \n``prove'' that all church income was generated solely for the benefit \nof one person, Pastor Alamo. The IRS claimed Pastor Alamo was the \n``owner'' of numerous businesses that were, in reality, owned by Music \nSquare Church, and that he had diverted funds from MSC and its \nbusinesses for his own use. In order to convict Pastor Alamo, the IRS \nhad to establish that he exerted absolute control over both the members \nof the church and the businesses of MSC. To prove this theory, the IRS \nreadily adopted the language and theories of the Cult Awareness Network \n(CAN), an anti-religious organization, that attacked churches and \nreligions that they deemed were illegitimate.\nA Brief History\n    Pastor Alamo and his wife Susan Alamo (now deceased) built a \nfundamentalist orthodox Christian ministry by going out on the streets \nof California and preaching to young people, many of whom were drug-\naddicts, criminals and hippies. In 1969, they incorporated the Tony and \nSusan Alamo Foundation (TSAF), which was granted tax-exempt status in \n1973. As a result of their work, hundreds of youth turned to the church \nfor salvation, and the church grew quickly. As it grew, Alamo also \nattracted the attention of CAN. CAN, acting as the ``almighty'' arbiter \nof religious correctness, made a fortune ``cult-baiting'' churches that \nthey did not like, and CAN psychologists charged susceptible parents \nthousands of dollars to ``deprogram'' their children. CAN has since \nbeen forced into bankruptcy for these practices, after a jury fined \nthem $4 million for religious persecution, and for illegally kidnapping \nand deprogramming a young man.\n    While there is nothing illegal, per se, with the government seeking \nCAN's help, what is illegal is for the government to adopt the \nperspective of an organization like CAN when that perspective is an \nattack on constitutionally protected religious practices and beliefs. \nOver the past several years, major religious scholars and leaders have \nattested to Pastor Alamo's deep religious convictions, whether or not \nthey agree with these convictions. At the same time CAN's ``cult/\nbrainwashing'' construct has been debunked by the American \nPsychological Association, the Society for the Scientific Study of \nReligion, and the American Sociological Association. Furthermore, the \ncourts have repeatedly ruled that anti-cult and brainwashing testimony \nis inadmissible in court because it does not rely upon a generally or \neven substantially accepted scientific foundation.\n    The IRS, however, never consulted with religious scholars or \nleaders to determine the validity of Pastor Alamo's religious theories, \nor, for that matter, CAN's theories. They ignored a Supreme Court \ndecision, which recognized the legitimacy of the church, and they \nignored the protections provided to First Amendment activities against \ngovernment interference or persecution. The IRS completely disregarded \nthe missionary activities of the church, and the fact that the church \nprovided food, clothing, lodging, schooling, and jobs for its \nfollowers. The church's good works, such as taking young people off \ndrugs, and giving them faith in God and a reason to live, were also \ncompletely ignored. The IRS spent close to 20 years devising (and \nimaginatively building) a criminal case against Pastor Alamo.\n    The IRS launched its investigation. They initiated two criminal \ninvestigations of Pastor Alamo, the first from 1973 to 1975, and the \nsecond from 1977 to 1980, both of which were dropped after no criminal \nliability was found. Yet this didn't stop the IRS--they initiated a \nthird investigation.\n    In the middle of its criminal investigation, two former church \nmembers, Robert and Carey Miller, hooked up with CAN and attorney Peter \nGeorgiades, and sued the church for supposedly stealing their trucking \nbusiness. In actuality, the Miller brothers had been forced to leave \nthe church after it was discovered that they embezzled over $100,000 of \nchurch money. However, the judge in the trial was apparently taken in \nby a frenzy of ``cult hysteria'' and sensationalized hostile news \naccounts about Pastor Alamo, and took the case to trial without Pastor \nAlamo or any representatives from the church present. He issued a $1.4 \nmillion default judgement against Alamo, stating that church workshops \nand businesses, including the trucking business, were ``alter egos'' of \nPastor Alamo. In other words, Alamo followers were brainwashed, and \nPastor Alamo controlled all church-run activities.\n    After the trial, the government went a step further, and indicted \nAlamo for threatening to kidnap the judge in the case, Morris S. \nArnold. The government literally based their case on one newspaper \naccount. Alamo had merely publicly criticized the judge's decision, but \nthe media hype was bordering on hysteria. The case went to a jury \ntrial, and Alamo was immediately acquitted.\n    The Millers were to become the government's key witnesses against \nPastor Alamo. And as we will see later, the IRS withheld from the \ndefense its financial relationship with the Millers.\nIRS Storms Church Property\n    With this as a backdrop, in June of 1990, the IRS issued a jeopardy \nassessment, claiming Pastor Alamo owed $745,000 in personal income tax \nfor the years 1977-1980, and church-owned workshops owed $5 million in \ncorporate income taxes, and $1.6 million in unpaid employees' \nwithholding taxes. On June 11, the IRS seized all church property in \nNashville, Tennessee and Alma, Arkansas, including the famous ``Alamo \nof Nashville'' store along with its inventory, and all church records. \nAlamo challenged the IRS in court and Judge Thomas Wiseman abated the \nseizure, and ordered the merchandise and records resumed. However, \ninstead of resuming the property, the IRS turned everything over to the \nMiller's attorney, Peter Georgiades, toward the $1.4 million judgement.\n    Even though more than a million dollars worth of property and \nmerchandise had already been seized, the IRS staged a second raid. On \nFebruary 13, 1991, 60 U.S. Marshals with guns drawn, accompanied by \nPeter Georgiades and IRS officials, stormed the church's Alma and \nGeorgia Ridge, Arkansas communities, where over 200 families lived. \nThey confiscated their homes, businesses, personal possessions, and all \nchurch property, including two large office buildings containing all \nchurch records from beginning of ministry to the present. An estimated \n$50 million worth of property was taken. Several hundred families, \nincluding countless young children, were thrown out on the street, with \nonly what they could carry. They lost all their personal belongings--\ntheir private homes, furniture, clothing, all their cash, food, toys, \nschool materials, etc. One can only speculate that the government \nviewed these children as ``worthless brainwashed zombies'' who did not \ndeserve a roof over their heads.\n    The church made seven legal attempts in five different courts to \nget back their records in order to properly defend Pastor Alamo. They \nfailed. The government disingenuously claimed that the church abandoned \nthe records. However, church members were not allowed back on church \nproperty to get the records. Armed guards were at the gates, telephone \nlines were cut, and offices were sealed.\nNewly Discovered Documents Expose IRS Abuses\n    The Alamo Christian Churches recently received approximately 40,000 \npages of IRS documents through the discovery process and through FOIA \nrequests.\n1. New IRS documents make plain that the IRS prosecuted Alamo because \n        they decided he was a ``cult'' leader and not a real religious \n        leader.\n    The IRS attitude toward Alamo was made clear at an IRS policy \nmeeting of 617190. IRS Group Manager Ed Campbell counseled 16 fellow \nagents on how to deal with ``cults'' and on ``the nature of Tony \nAlamo's organization's followers as to their cult, brainwashing \nnature'' (page 24003).\n    The IRS issued a ``Background'' paper on the Tony and Susan Alamo \nFoundation which stated: ``Through brainwashing, Tony and Susan Alamo \nrequired the associates to provide increasing amounts of free services \nto the Foundation . . . '' (p. 53255).\n    IRS documents reference meetings between IRS agents and Cynthia \nKisser, chair of CAN, Pricilla Coates, Director of Los Angeles Chapter \nof the Cult Awareness Network, and the Cult Committee of the Jewish \nFederation (p. 51399, 51506, 52390-2, 52395-6, 52387-8 -9, 51419-61, \n58423-58425).\n    By the time the trial began, however, the IRS obviously recognized \nthe First Amendment implications of their cult-baiting, and agreed to \nhave the term ``cult'' stricken from the court records. Nonetheless, \nthe cult/brainwashing construct dominated the trial and was used by the \nprobation office to write Pastor Alamo's Pre-Sentence Investigation \nreport (PSI). The probation officer inserted all the unsubstantiated \nallegations made against Pastor Alamo at the trial by members of CAN. \nThe PSI has plagued Alamo through the prison system. He has been de-\nfacto jailed for crimes he has never been accused of or tried for in a \ncourt of law. He has been denied parole because of allegations in the \nPSI, and prison authorities refused to move him to a prison camp \nbecause of the PSI.\n2. Newly discovered documents prove that the prosecutor knowingly \n        concealed exculpatory material that he had a duty to disclose.\n    Robert and Carey Miller, crucial government witnesses, submitted \napplications to the IRS for reward money. Applicants submitted Form 211 \nto supply information to the IRS in exchange for a portion of the \ntaxes, penalties and fines recovered as a result. The prosecutor, \nAssistant US Attorney, J. Christopher Belcher, failed to notify the \ndefense. If the jury knew that the Millers were getting $21,000 each \nfor assisting in Alamo's conviction, they may have listened to the \nbrother's testimony differently, and would have gotten a more complete \npicture of why they were testifying. As it was, the jury had mixed \nfeelings, and took three days before issuing a verdict.\n    During the trial, Prosecutor Belcher knowingly elicited perjurious \nmaterial and misleading testimony from these government witnesses. \nBelcher asked Robert Miller and the two IRS agents responsible for the \ninvestigation, Larry Howlett and Charles Beuregard, whether they knew \nof any deals made with government witnesses. All three witnesses denied \nthese accusations. This testimony was false. All the witnesses knew it \nwas false, and the prosecutor knew it was false.\n3. New documents expose that the government misled the jury by \n        portraying Alamo as an obstructionist in its efforts to \n        investigate him and the MSC for withholding of the church's \n        financial ledgers. New documents show that the IRS agents lied \n        and were in possession of the ledgers long before the trial.\n    During the trial, Prosecutor Belcher asked Agent Howlett if he ever \nreceived any ledgers from MSC. Howlett answered, ``No, sir.'' Newly \ndiscovered documents proved that the IRS had recovered these records \nfrom the church. Howlett knew this to be true, and Prosecutor Belcher \nactually had these ledgers in his custody before the trial. Yet, the \ngovernment portrayed Alamo as attempting to derail its investigation by \nthe fact that the IRS was unable to retrieve ledgers from the church. \nJudge McCalla chose to believe IRS agents and used Alamo's supposed \nfailure to turn over these ledgers as the major reason for sentencing \nhim to the maximum time allowed.\n    A notation in Howlett's IRS Case Chronology Record February 22, \n1991 reads: ``There are more ledgers than expected . . . .To safeguard \nall the ledgers and journals, we moved all ledgers and journals . . . \nand sent them to the IRS office and stored them in their property \nroom'' (p. 51380-2).\n    In a July 21, 1993, IRS memorandum written by Howlett to case file, \nhe indicated possession of MSC ledgers and that Prosecutor Belcher knew \nabout them: ``I explained that there was one such box, and that was box \n16 containing the general ledgers. I mentioned that I was through with \nthey were under the control of Chris Belcher.''\n    In an October 3, 1990 letter to Alamo Attomey Neal Pendergraft, \nHowlett acknowledged that the ledgers had been received for some church \nactivities. Alamo had no knowledge of such an agreement. Documents \nfurther show that arrangements to move the records were done with the \nassistance of US Marshall Rick Bean.\n4. New evidence reveals that the prosecutor failed to turn over IRS \n        memoranda of previous investigations of Alamo and MSC, which \n        were discontinued for lack of wrongdoing.\n    The IRS did not reveal information of prior IRS investigations of \nPastor Alamo that should have been turned over in pre-trial discovery. \nSuch evidence would have allowed the defense to explore why previous \ninvestigations did not produce formal charges of criminal or civil \nliability and would have supported the defense's allegations of \ngovernment harassment.\n    The IRS also did not reveal a 9/23/82 memorandum by the Civil \nRights Division of DOJ that a DOJ/FBI criminal investigation of Alamo \nfor involuntary servitude was dropped after concluding there was no \nbasis to pursue criminal charges.\n5. New evidence exposes that the IRS hid pertinent interviews with \n        Alamo accountants from the defense.\n    The IRS conducted two interviews with Alamo's accountant in 1981. \nIRS notes establish that the accountant knew of no wrongdoing. On 3/6/\n81, IRS Agents Erickson and Clarke interviewed two New York CPA's, \nArthur Appleman and A.B. Wiener, who had worked on Alamo's financial \nbooks. Appleman stated that during the course of the firm's work, \nnothing was brought to his attention indicating that Alamo was paying \npersonal expenses from Foundation funds, and that ``nothing was brought \nto his attention regarding improper handling of cash receipts.'' While \nnot directly related to the years in questions, this could have helped \nAlamo's attorney prepare more thoroughly for cross-examination of \nformer church members and in terms of possible witnesses for the trial.\n    IRS documents show that on 10/01/90, Agent Dan Brautweiller \ncontacted CPA Bill Bealle who had done work for the Tony and Susan \nAlamo Foundation (TSAF). Bealle stated that he did not feel Alamo was \nrequired to file with the IRS. The content of this interview was \nwithheld from the defense.\n    The IRS quotes from an interview with former TSAF attorney Stanley \nbusinesses were rehabilitation facilities and Form 990-T would not be \nrequired.''\n6. Agent's Howlett and Beauregard testified that no deals were made \n        with any witnesses. Besides Robert and Carey Miller, at least \n        three other witnesses who agreed to cooperate with the IRS \n        filed for reward money.\n    These witnesses included, Chris Coie, the estranged daughter of \nSusan Alamo. IRS documents reveal that the IRS worked with Chris Cole \nfor 17 years.\n    Another witness was Elizabeth Caldwell (a former wife of Alamo). \nHowlett wrote of his efforts to retrieve her furniture, which had been \ntaken along with hundreds of others when the IRS raided Georgia Ridge \n(p. 23877).\n    IRS notes reveal they gave immunity to Diana Williams at her grand \njury testimony in the western District of Tennessee, March 10, 1993 (p. \n51369-71). Williams testified against Pastor Alamo.\n7. IRS documents expose that agents knew, but did not disclose, that \n        information they received from former disgruntled church \n        members was less than reliable.\ngood as witnesses had said that it would.'' Former church members \nclaimed the Tyne Boulevard property was a mansion, and that Alamo lived \na lavish lifestyle (p. 23975).\n    Dave Kroopf, a former church member, stated in an affidavit to the \nIRS that Alamo had guns on various church sites. IRS agents discovered \nthis not to be true, nonetheless, relied on Kroopf for important \ninformation regarding church business.\n    The IRS relied on information from a private investigator hired by \nthe Millers and Elizabeth Caldwell. The investigator claimed that Alamo \nhad fled the country with large sums of money. The IRS never checked \nthe information, and used this as an excuse to levy a jeopardy \nassessment against Alamo. All the merchandise at the church's Nashville \nstore was seized. While the judge ordered the assessment abated, and \nruled that there was no basis for it, the merchandise was never \nreturned (p. 51401-2, 23872-23882).\n    The IRS relied on pertinent information from Chis Coie, Susan \nAlamo's estranged daughter whom she had disowned. Coie's accusations \nhad to be suspect when she claimed that her mother did not have cancer \nand was using it as a ploy to solicit money from sympathetic people. \nSusan Alamo died of cancer in 1982. At one point, based on Coie's \nrecommendation, the IRS ordered a doctor to release Alamo from a \nhospital. The doctor refused.\n8. IRS documents reveal that agents used ``persuasive means'' to get \n        witnesses to talk.\n    Documents expose that the IRS met several times with Birgitta \nGyllenhammer (a former Alamo wife) to convince her to reverse her \ndecision not to talk with them. While there is no mention of how \nGyllenhammer suddenly became a government witness, there is a \nhandwritten note from Howlett reminding himself to check her 1040's. \nGyllenhammer had substantial tax liens on her clothing business (p. \n51453-55, 51459, 61570-61572).\nthat my purpose was to determine who benefited from monetary \ntransactions in which he was involved and to determine the source of \nthe funds.'' Howlett later wrote, ``I explained that by having an \nexplanation of the fund transfers we wouldn't have to prepare tax \nreturns on him individually.'' The IRS did not reveal the content of \ntheir interview with LaRoche to the defense, which could have impeached \ntestimony from CAN witnesses."

"","","moynihan","Daniel Patrick Moynihan","    During four days of recent public hearings by this Senate \ncommittee, the American public was presented with stunning evidence of \npolitical targeting and other criminal misconduct by officials of the \nCriminal Investigative Division (CID) of the Internal Revenue Service. \nThe April 30, 1998 testimony of former Sen. Howard Baker, who also \nserved as President Reagan's Chief of Staff, was particularly chilling, \nas was the April 29, 1998 daylong testimony of three small businessmen, \nwho found their enterprises decimated, their finances ruined, and their \npersonal lives shattered, as the result of the outright criminality of \nIRS agents. At one point, Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan queried the three men \nabout the role of federal prosecutors and the U.S. Department of \nJustice in their ordeals. Sen. Moynihan correctly pointed out that, \nonce the IRS action moved into a phase of grand jury deliberation and \ncriminal prosecution, the IRS was necessarily abetted by U.S. Attorneys \nand officials in the Criminal Division of the Main Justice Department \nin Washngton. He pressed for the Webster Commission probe into abuses \nby the IRS to be broadened to include the inter-relationship between \nIRS agents and federal prosecutors.\n    The Lyndon LaRouche case, which is the subject of this testimony, \nhas been described by former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark as \n``about as close as a case gets to the potential perfidy of justice . . \n. In what was a complex and pervasive utilization of law enforcement, \nprosecution, media, and non- governmental organizations focussed on \ndestroying an enemy, this case must be number one. There are some, \nwhere the government itself may have done more and more wrongfully over \na period of time; but the very networking and combination of federal, \nstate and local agencies, of executive and even some legislative and \njudicial branches, of major media and minor localmedia, and of \ninluencial lobbyist types, the ADL preeminently; this case takes the \nprize.'' Indeed, the LaRouche case represented far more than a run-away \naction by rogue agents of the IRS. In the LaRouche case, the IRS played \na pivotal role, in a concert of action, involving prominent and \npowerful political figures, typified by former Secretary of State Henry \nKissinger; elements of the national security establishment; \npolitically-driven U.S. Attorneys and high-ranking officials of the \nCriminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice; elements of the \nnational media, who committed the equivalent of witting perjury, by \ntransmitting, through television and the print news media, slanders and \nfabrications, provided by the IRS and the DOJ, to mislead the American \npublic and create a climate conducive to a railroad prosecution of an \nentire political movement. Again, to quote former Attorney General \nClark: ``The purpose can only be seen as destroying--it's more than a \npolitical movement, it's more than a political figure; it is those two. \nBut it's a fertile engine of ideas, a common purpose of thinking and \nstudying and analyzing to solve problems, regardless of the impact on \nthe status quo, or on vested interests. It was a deliberate purpose to \ndestroy that at any cost.'' As the accompanying chronology will show, \nthe political targeting of Lyndon LaRouche for frame-up and jailing--or \nworse--began in ernest in August of 1982, when Henry Kissinger wrote a \npersonal note to then-FBI Director William Webster, demanding that the \nFBI and Department of Justice take action against the LaRouche \npolitical movement. Throughout the autumn of that year, there was \ncorrespondence back and forth between Kissinger, his attorneys and \nofficials of the FBI and Department of Justice. Kissinger's lawyers \nwere, in effect, coached on how to frame their complaints against \nLaRouche, to trigger a national security probe of the LaRouche \nmovement, using broad authorities prescribed in Executive Order 12333, \nwhich was ostensibly aimed at combatting foreign espionage, \ninternational terrorism and international narcotics trafficking--none \nof which applied to LaRouche and his associates. By January 1983, \nKissinger's efforts resulted in a formal authorization, from members of \nthe President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, for an E.O. 12333 \nprobe of LaRouche's finances. The Kissinger-instigated action led to a \ndecade-long nightmare, culminating in two events:\n  <bullet> On Oct. 6, 1986, over 400 federal, state and local law \n        enforcement officers--including, prominently, officials of the \n        IRS/CID--staged a dawn raid on the publishing offices of Lyndon \n        LaRouche. The ostensible purpose was to execute two search \n        warrants, and four arrest warrants against individuals who had \n        never been previously charged with anything more serious than a \n        speeding ticket. The raiding party, it was later learned, was \n        backed up by armored personnel carriers, helicopters, fixed \n        wing aircraft, and, for good measure, special counter-terror \n        units of the U.S. military. Fortunately, cool heads prevailed, \n        and a Waco-style bloodbath was averted, although court \n        testimony later revealed that there were federal law \n        enforcement officials who were anxious to trigger such an \n        outcome. Wildly fabricated ``informant'' information, that led \n        to the near-bloodbath, was provided, in large part, by \n        individuals working closely with the lead IRS agent in the \n        federal-state ``Get LaRouche'' task force.\n  <bullet> Between Jan. 1989-1992, Lyndon LaRouche and a dozen of his \n        political associates were sent to federal and state prison on a \n        range of frame-up white collar and tax charges; a tax exempt \n        foundation and three commercial enterprises were illegally shut \n        down by a fraudulent federal bankruptcy action, that the courts \n        later ruled was ``constructive fraud upon the court.'' Lyndon \n        LaRouche was sentenced to fifteen years in federal prison. \n        Several LaRouche associates, prosecuted in the Commonwealth of \n        Virginia, were sentenced to up to 77 years in state prison--on \n        first offense white collar crimes!\n    As you will see below, the Internal Revenue Service played a \ncentral role in this travesty of justice. In addition to this written \ntestimony, the Schiller Institute will provide the Committee with \nbackground documentation on all of the matters highlighted here. Among \nthe material to be provided is:\n  <bullet> the statements, quoted above, from former Attorney General \n        Ramsey Clark. Clark delivered those comments during testimony \n        at a two day public hearing, Aug. 31-Sept. 1, 1995, before an \n        independent commission co-chaired by former Congressman James \n        Mann of South Carolina, and J.L. Chestnut, one of the foremost \n        civil rights lawyers in America today.\n  <bullet> the correspondence between Henry Kissinger, his attorneys, \n        former FBI Director William Webster, and other senior officials \n        of the Justice Department and the FBI, all of which were \n        obtained under the Freedom of Information and Privacy Act. A \n        memorandum from the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory \n        Board (PFIAB), also obtained under FOIPA.\n    To summarize the pattern of abuse and criminal misconduct by agents \nof the IRS in the LaRouche case, IRS officials:\n  <bullet> Targeted LaRouche for politically motivated reasons and \n        allowed political opponents of LaRouche to utilize the power of \n        the IRS for their political aims.\n  <bullet> Systematically leaked confidential taxpayer information and \n        false allegations to the media and private individuals.\n  <bullet> Allowed its agents to illegally gather information on \n        LaRouche and his political associates without any investigative \n        authorization.\n  <bullet> Issued baseless assessments of taxes to LaRouche and \n        companies associated with his political efforts, which were \n        indefensible in a court of law.\n  <bullet> Engaged in all the above types of activities for the stated \n        purpose of creating financial harm to companies and individuals \n        who were political associates of LaRouche.\n    The summary of illicit IRS actions in the LaRouche prosecution \nwhich follows, has been constructed from independent investigations, \nFOIPA documents, and the public record of court proceedings. It \nrepresents the information concerning IRS abuses which could be \nobtained by these limited means. Only by further investigation of the \nevents listed below can Congress assure itself that the IRS is no \nlonger employed as an instrument of political prosecution.\n     September 1982-January 1983. Henry Kissinger initiates action \nagainst LaRouche. President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board takes \nformal action.\n     1983-1984. A series of meetings is convened at the Manhattan \napartment of New York investment advisor John Train. According to a \nparticipant, Michael Hudson, the purpose of these meetings was to \n``coordinate national magazine stuff about you guys and work with \nfederal law enforcement to deny you funding and tax exemption is the \ndelicate way to put it.'' Other participants include Roy Godson, then a \nconsultant to the National Security Council and PFIAB; John Rees, a \nlongtime FBI informant; representatives of the Anti-Defamation League \nof B'nai B'rith (``ADL''); representatives of Freedom House, a private \nresearch organization headed by PFIAB chairman Leo Cherne; financier \nand propagandist Richard Mellon Scaife; NBC producer Pat Lynch; Dennis \nKing, a paid propagandist against LaRouche funded by the ADL and the \nSmith-Richardson Foundation; reporters and editors from the Wall Street \nJournal, Reader's Digest, Business Week and the New Republic.\n    One participant in the Train salon, Chip Berlet, has stated that he \nwas introduced to many other individuals at Train's apartment who were \nidentified only as ``gentlemen with a government connection.'' At the \ntime, the Fusion Energy Foundation, a leading proponent of beam weapons \nballistic missile defense, was a tax exempt foundation under the \nInternal Revenue Code. FEF was considered by LaRouche's political \nopponents to be a major source of respectability and funding for \nLaRouche's ideas. According to Hudson, he was put into contact with the \nBaltimore regional office of the IRS to further the slander and \nunwarranted prosecution campaign detailed at the Train salon meetings. \nThat office had purview over exempt organizations. In response to FOIPA \nrequests, the IRS disclaims that it has a file concerning these events \nor any file at all concerning the Fusion Energy Foundation.\n     November 1983-March of 1984. NBC producer Pat Lynch, a participant \nin the Train meetings, produces two major smear pieces on LaRouche, a \ndeclared presidential candidate, which air in January and March of \n1984. According to its sworn responses to civil discovery requests in a \nsubsequent lawsuit, NBC received non- public IRS investigative \ninformation about LaRouche. The broadcasts promote the idea that \nLaRouche should be investigated by the IRS. Other than a one line \nreference to contacts with Lynch, IRS documents released under the FOIA \ncontain no information about these events.\n     November of 1984. Boston U.S. Attorney William Weld launches a \ngrand jury investigation of LaRouche's presidential campaign based upon \nallegations of credit card fraud. These allegations are first publicly \naired by Boston NBC affiliate WBZ in collaboration with the FBI and \nreceive national media attention.\n     February of 1985. Following a request for IRS investigation of \nLaRouche by IRS Agent Larry Lucey of the Criminal Investigation \nDivision of the Richmond District, the IRS Richmond Director ordered \nthat any investigation of Lyndon LaRouche's non-filer status be handled \nas a civil examination matter. LaRouche declared publicly throughout \nhis campaign that he had not filed taxes. LaRouche's attorneys had \nadvised him that based upon the unusual circumstances in which LaRouche \nlived and worked because of repeated threats to his life by terrorists, \nhe had no taxable income. No civil audit of LaRouche, as recommended by \nthe Richmond Director, was ever undertaken however. Such an audit would \nhave readily resolved any actual issues concerning LaRouche's income \ntax liability.\n     November of 1985. Following a year of grand jury testimony, \ncovering every aspect of the finances of the LaRouche movement, Boston \nU.S. Attorney Weld seeks a national tax investigation. The central \nallegation concerns whether it was proper for associates of LaRouche to \nclaim independent consultant status for paid political organizing \nactivities. Following a February 1986 law enforcement conference called \nby Weld to discuss ``prosecutive theories'' against LaRouche, the \nnational tax task force approach is rejected by other prosecutors.\n     September of 1985-June of 1986. The IRS through CID agent Larry \nLucey employs the Loudoun County Sheriff's Department and Loudoun \nSheriff's Deputy Donald Moore as confidential informants in a rogue \ninvestigation of LaRouche. No crimimal investigation of LaRouche by the \nIRS had been authorized at the time of these activities--in fact \nauthorization had been specifically declined.\n     Sheriff's Department personnel stated that the purpose of their \ninvestigations was to destroy LaRouche's electoral aspirations. During \nthe course of their IRS sanctioned activities, the Sheriff's Department \nillegally obtained social security numbers on members of LaRouche's \npolitical movement when they registered to vote, and engaged in black \nbag jobs, bank account monitoring, and warrantless electronic \nsurveillance against LaRouche and his associates. Deputy Donald Moore \nadmitted many of these activities to an FBI informant, Douglas Poppa, \nin 1994, subsequent to LaRouche's trial and conviction. The ADL was at \nall times working with Moore and the Loudoun County Sheriff and, in all \nprobability, also functioned as a confidential informant to the IRS.\n     February of 1986-August of 1986. The participants in the John \nTrain salon launch an unprecedented wave of black propaganda and dirty \ntricks against LaRouche and his associates. In an international effort, \nlater proved to be the work of the East German intelligence services, \nLaRouche is accused of involvement in the assassination of Swedish \nPrime Minister Olaf Palme. In the wake of the victories of two LaRouche \nassociates in the Illinois statewide Democratic primaries for governor \nand lieutenant governor, there are numerous illegal leaks of \ninformation from the Boston grand jury and the IRS which receive \nnationwide airing in the Wall Street Journal, Reader's Digest, the \nAssociated Press, the Washington Post, Newsweek and NBC.\n    A central lie repeated throughout the propaganda campaign concerned \nLaRouche's alleged ``lavish'' lifestyle for which he paid no taxes. In \nreality, LaRouche lived on rented properties during this period and had \nno lavish lifestyle, a fact which the IRS well knew. Prominent among \nthe defamations during this period were NBC TV news broadcasts in April \nof 1986 for which the IRS provided information and which ended with the \nassertion that there was ``an open IRS investigation of LaRouche and \nindividuals associated with him.''\n     June of 1986. Newly appointed U.S. attorney Henry Hudson declares \nLaRouche to be an investigative priority in the Eastern District of \nVirginia. He creates a task force which includes the IRS. The declared \npurpose of the task force is to ``create as much probable cause as \npossible'' for search warrants against LaRouche and entities and \nindividuals associated with him. Thus, after two years of investigation \nand illegal operations, the government has to create a task force in \norder to obtain a broad license to fish for any crime they can \nfabricate against LaRouche.\n     September 1986. Boston U.S. Attorney William Weld is appointed to \nhead the Justice Department Criminal Division.\n     September of 1986. The IRS falsely claims to the Associated Press \nthat the Fusion Energy Foundation's tax exempt status has been revoked \nand releases other information about the FEF to reporter William Welch. \nAs a result, the Associated Press, in a national wire, claims that \nsolicitors for the FEF are committing tax fraud by stating that the FEF \nis tax exempt. After threats of legal action, the IRS claimed that it \nhad made a ``mistake'' concerning FEF's status when discussing the FEF \nwith reporter Welch and that the FEF was, indeed, still tax exempt. As \npreviously noted, in response to FOIA requests, the IRS has disclaimed \nthat it has any file on the Fusion Energy Foundation. ``Law enforcement \nsources'' bragged to the Washington Post during September, 1986 that \nthe massive negative publicity in the wake of the Illinois primary \nvictories by two LaRouche associates had devastated the LaRouche \nmovement financially.\n     October 6-7, 1986. IRS agents, along with FBI, ATF, and Virginia \nState Police participate in a 400 person armed raid on offices of \nentities associated with LaRouche. Documents obtained during the raid \nare initially taken to a military facility for examination as a result \nof top secret negotiations with the Pentagon.\n     April of 1987. The United States launches an unprecedented \nbankruptcy liquidation of Campaigner Publications, Caucus Distributors, \nand the Fusion Energy Foundation, the principal publishers of \nLaRouche's ideas. IRS Agent Lucey, who was subsequently described in \ngovernment documents as the ``elder statesman'' of the federal criminal \ntask force and the ``resident expert'' on LaRouche plays an active role \nin assisting the civil bankruptcy action. The bankruptcy action is \nlater dismissed as illegal by Federal Judge Martin Bostetter who \nlikened it to a ``constructive fraud'' upon the Court. The bankruptcy \nends any ability to repay the loans at issue in the subsequent federal \nindictment of LaRouche for loan fraud.\n     June of 1987. LaRouche is indicted for conspiracy to obstruct \njustice in Boston as a result of Boston U.S. William Weld's two and \none/half year investigation.\n     May of 1988. The Boston criminal case ends in a mistrial amid \nhearings airing major prosecutorial misconduct. Federal Judge Robert \nKeeton in a written decision characterizes law enforcement misconduct \nin the LaRouche case as ``systemic.''\n     February 1987-October 14, 1988. Following examination of \nvoluminous financial records seized during the October raid and grand \njury investigation, the U.S. attorney concludes that no evasion charges \ncan be brought against LaRouche or the companies paying LaRouche's \nexpenses because such charges lack prosecutive merit. Instead, a \nconspiracy charge will be brought against LaRouche alone and unnamed \nco-conspirators, a charge which the U.S. Attorney described as \n``novel.'' The conspiracy charged is that LaRouche conspired to conceal \nhis income from the IRS. In addition LaRouche is charged with a loan \nfraud conspiracy and as an aider and abettor in the obtaining of other \nfraudulent loans. LaRouche's trial occurred-- days after indictment. \nMajor defenses, including any reference to the fact that the federal \ngovernment brought the bankrutpcy, were banned by the trial judge. His \njury which had been saturated with propaganda about his alleged lavish \nlifestyle. The conviction on the nebulous conspiracy charges was a \nforegone conclusion.\n     January 1989-1991. The IRS commences civil enforcement actions \nagainst individuals and companies associated with LaRouche as part of a \nstrategy to drive the LaRouche movement out of existence in the wake of \nLaRouche's conviction and jailing. These actions again are widely \npublicized by NBC national news. The most prominent IRS actions involve \nassessments against PGM, the financial management company associated \nwith the LaRouche movement and LaRouche personally. The IRS initially \nclaimed that PGM owed $2,773,882 in unpaid taxes, an assesment the IRS \nknew to be without merit. After years of litigation and legal fees \nincurred by PGM, in which the IRS repeatedly took indefensible \npositions in the Tax Court, the IRS has agreed, after a review of \ndocuments which had been available to it all along, that PGM has no tax \nliability. The IRS has taken a similarly outlandish position with \nrespect to LaRouche personally. Originally the IRS claimed that \nLaRouche owed $5,844,074 in taxes, interest and penalties. After years \nof litigation, the IRS now states that the figure to be $353,444. \nLaRouche disputes the entire amount. That case is presently scheduled \nfor trial in the tax court.\n     In conclusion, the Schiller Institute wishes to thank the Senate \nFinance Committee for the opportunity to present this testimony. We \nwill be happy to provide the Committee with any further documentation \nthat may be required in the course of the ongoing investigation into \nthe abuses by the IRS."
