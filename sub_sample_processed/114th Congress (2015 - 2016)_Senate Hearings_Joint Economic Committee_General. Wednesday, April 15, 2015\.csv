"chairman,","Hon. Dan Coats, Chairman,","","","                        Joint Economic Committee\n    It is fitting that on Tax Day, April 15, we are examining one of \nthe most vexing challenges for small business--our burdensome and \nincomprehensible tax code.\n    A quote by an unknown source represents the entrepreneurial spirit \nI have witnessed representing Hoosiers in Washington: ``Small business \nisn't for the faint of heart. It's for the brave, the patient and the \npersistent. It's for the overcomer.''\n    The small business owners I have met are brave, patient, and \npersistent. They are indeed overcomers. Despite the obstacles small \nbusinesses face, they are responsible for two-thirds of the net new \nprivate-sector jobs created in the United States. Our role as \nlegislators should be to ensure that the tax code is no longer a major \nobstacle to growth and jobs for these businesses.\n    Against the headwinds of the slowest recovery since 1960, small \nbusiness owners have to deal with a tax system that is hopelessly \ncomplex, full of provisions that expire every one or two years, riddled \nwith special exemptions, deductions, and preferences, and filled with \nnew penalties.\n    The Small Business Administration lists tax paperwork as the most \ncostly paperwork burden the Federal Government imposes on small \nbusinesses at $74 per hour or $1,500 per employee. It is not surprising \nthat nine out of 10 small business owners have to turn to an outside \npaid professional to figure out their taxes.\n    Today we will hear from witnesses who can discuss how tax policy is \naffecting the broad landscape of small businesses. We will also hear \ntwo stories of real businesses that will bring home how taxes affect \ncompanies on the ground.\n    We hear these stories every day:"

"","","chairman,","Hon. Kevin Brady, Vice Chairman,","    Today, I want to focus on a particular challenge confronting \nfarmers, ranchers, and small business owners--the death tax. All too \noften, families must sell their farms, ranches, and small businesses to \npay Uncle Sam's death tax. One fifth-generation Texas ranch I know-\nwhich started back in the 1800s--had to sell 2/3 of that historic land \nto pay the death tax. That's just wrong.\n    What is worse--if you can imagine it--is that the death tax is \nespecially destructive for women- and minority owned small businesses. \nThey're the fastest growing sector of small businesses and start-ups in \nthis country.\n    Bob Johnson, the founder of BET television, observed the death tax \n``continues to pose a serious threat to the likelihood that present-day \nAfrican American-owned businesses can be preserved as part of a \nfamily's long-term legacy.''\n    President Obama insists that the death tax is necessary to remedy \nincome inequality. Yet, that just isn't so. Former Vice Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board Alan Blinder found that only two percent of \nincome inequality can be explained by inherited wealth.\n    The death tax motivates the wealthy to reduce their savings and \nincrease their consumption spending now rather than pass their wealth \non to the next generation. The death tax actually increases the \nconsumption gap between the wealthy and the poor in America. Moreover, \nthe death tax leaves all Americans poorer as the productive investment \nin new buildings, equipment, and intellectual property--which those \nsavings would have funded--does not occur and the jobs that such \ninvestment would have generated are not created.\n    This reminds me of President Reagan's aphorism about our friends' \nknowing so much that isn't so.\n    Democrats claim that ``special use valuation'' is an alternative \nway to exempt farms, ranches, and small businesses from the death tax. \nWe've tried these gimmicks before. They don't work. They just throw \nadditional burdens and complexity on family businesses and tie them up \nin red tape for years after death.\n    Enough with the gimmicks and complicated workarounds. They don't \nwork. Right now, our country is facing a $1.5 trillion Growth Gap \ncompared with an average recovery since 1960. That means we're missing \n5.5 million private-sector jobs. The average family of four is missing \nalmost a thousand dollars a month. Our recovery is so bad, we're going \nto need 7.4 percent growth in real GDP each and every quarter just to \ncatch up to the average recovery by the time President Obama leaves the \nWhite House.\n    We need American entrepreneurs and family businesses to close that \ngap. They're the backbone, the engine of our economy. But the death tax \nhas robbed them of $1.1 trillion in capital stock. The Tax Foundation \nestimated that in 2005 the death tax cost American taxpayers $88.2 \nmillion and 2.3 million hours of effort just in compliance. Imagine if \nall of that could have been invested in new jobs and business \nopportunities. I don't think I need to stress to anyone here how \ndesperately we need that.\n    The Treasury collected $19.5 billion in estate and gift taxes over \nthe last 12 months. In contrast, the Treasury spends $9.9 billion per \nday. The death tax generates less than two days of federal spending.\n    This week, the House of Representatives will vote to repeal the \ndeath tax once and for all. I hope the Senate will join the House and \napprove this truly progressive legislation and send it to President \nObama.\n    I look forward to today's discussion with our witnesses.\n                               __________"
"member,","Carolyn B. Maloney, Ranking Member,","chairman,","Hon. Kevin Brady, Vice Chairman,","                        Joint Economic Committee\n    Thank you Chairman Coats for holding today's hearing. I also want \nto thank all of the witnesses for being here today.\n    There is broad agreement that small businesses are the backbone of \nthe economy, the anchors of our communities, and that they have played \nan important role in the current recovery.\n                          actions by democrats\n    When President Obama took over from George W. Bush, the economy was \nin free fall and small businesses were bearing the brunt of the pain. \nOver the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, small \nbusinesses shed more than three million jobs.\n    President Obama and Democrats in Congress, along with the Federal \nReserve, took bold action to turn things around in the darkest days of \nthe Great Recession. These actions included a number of efforts to \nsupport small businesses.\n    For example, the Recovery Act cut taxes for small businesses, \nallowing them to immediately deduct up to $250,000 of investment, carry \nback losses for five years, and exclude from taxation 75% of capital \ngains from small business investment.\n                       small business job growth\n    Today, small businesses are leading the economic recovery. Small \nbusinesses have added more than six million jobs over 17 straight \nquarters of small business job growth (see chart #1).\n    We have come a long ways in the past six years. The share of small \nbusinesses planning to add jobs is back near its pre-recession average \n(see chart #2).\n    While this reflects major progress, I believe we need to do more to \nsupport small business growth.\n    The Administration's tax reform plan, for example, would simplify \nand cut taxes for America's small businesses. President Obama's revenue \nproposal includes expanding and permanently extending increased section \n179 expensing for small businesses. The proposal would also increase \nthe number of small businesses that can take advantage of simpler cash \naccounting rules.\n    The Administration's approach provides tax cuts for small \nbusinesses in a fiscally responsible way and in the context of broader \nbusiness tax reform. By contrast, the Republicans in the House have \npassed bills without offsets--which would blow massive holes in the \nbudget.\n                        small business attitudes\n    Some of my Republican colleagues would have us believe that small \nbusinesses are up in arms about the Obama Administration's policies. \nBut this chart--based on survey data provided by the NFIB, one of our \nwitnesses today--shows that the share of small businesses listing taxes \nas their top concern is no greater today than when Ronald Reagan left \noffice (see chart # 3).\n    Ronald Reagan!\n               some ``small'' businesses are quite large\n    One of our principal goals today should be to decide what a small \nbusiness is for tax purposes.\n    While most of the 95 percent of businesses that are organized as \npass-throughs are small--many are extremely large. Numerous large law \nfirms, accounting firms, hedge funds and other businesses are pass-\nthroughs.\n    The tax code treats these large businesses the same as ``mom and \npop'' stores down the street. But, should it?\n    When designing tax policy, fairness should be a principal concern. \nSome large multinationals pay less than small businesses and some \nextremely large companies don't pay any federal income taxes at all.\n    In other words, the corner store likely pays more in federal income \ntaxes than some of our country's largest corporations. Those who are \ncritical of our tax system should save some of their outrage for this.\n                               estate tax\n    Before taking on tax reform, Republicans have proposed repealing \nthe estate tax and they plan to vote on it in the House later today or \ntomorrow.\n    Let's be clear: repealing the estate tax would be a major windfall \nfor the wealthiest Americans. With the current exemption amounts of \nover $5 million per person and more than $10 million per couple, the \nestate tax affects only two out of 1,000 estates. In other words, 99.8 \npercent of Americans do not pay any estate tax (see chart #4).\n    Republicans say they are motivated by a desire to protect small \nbusinesses. But that's something of a Trojan horse. Only about 20 small \nbusiness and small farm estates owed any estate tax in 2013, according \nto the Tax Policy Center. Twenty!\n    Repealing the estate tax is also very expensive. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation found that repealing the estate tax would \nincrease the deficit by $269 billion over 10 years.\n                     need for bipartisan tax reform\n    1986 was a massive overhaul and simplification of the tax code. The \nminute the ink was dry, work began to undo it. And trust me, it wasn't \nsmall businesses at the table.\n    We must make sure that any tax reform benefits the small firms, not \njust the big multinationals gaming the system to further limit their \ntax obligations.\n    Tax reform is hard. That's why there hasn't been a major rewrite of \nthe code in about 30 years. For it to work, it must be comprehensive \nand it must be bipartisan. There is no other path forward.\n    I look forward to hearing the perspective of our witnesses this \nafternoon. Thank you for appearing before the Committee."

"ceo,","Jody Fledderman, President & CEO,","member,","Carolyn B. Maloney, Ranking Member,","                         Batesville Tool & Die\n    Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today about the \nimpact of taxes on small and medium- sized manufacturing businesses. My \nname is Jody Fledderman; I have been President and CEO of Batesville \nTool and Die in Batesville, Indiana since 1989. For over 30 years, \nBatesville Tool & Die has been providing quality metal stamping and \nstamping assemblies for our automotive, appliance, industrial and other \nindustry customers. We currently have 395 employees and would hire more \nif we could find qualified workers.\n    In addition, I was the 2014 Chairman of the Precision Metalforming \nAssociation and serve on Board of Directors for both the Indiana \nManufacturers Association and the Indiana Chamber of Commerce. I think \nmy positions on state and national boards and running my own business, \nprovide me a unique perspective of the challenges facing manufacturers \nin Indiana and across the country.\n    The single greatest obstacle to growing my business in the long \nterm is the uncertainty surrounding our tax code. How can Congress \nexpect us to plan when we do not know what the rates will be in the \nfuture?\n    How can lawmakers carelessly continue putting off their \nresponsibilities until the last hour? Too often it feels as if people \nin Washington are so insulated from the real world they do not \nrecognize their inaction has significant consequences for families and \nbusinesses throughout the country. It is very difficult to plan for the \nfuture when you don't even know the rules for today.\n    I truly believe our economy would have recovered more quickly if \nbusinesses felt comfortable that Washington would set the rules and \nstop meddling for a while. This is why we need comprehensive tax \nreform. Not just to lower our rates to globally competitive levels but \nalso to provide stability and predictability in the Internal Revenue \nCode. Washington should develop tax policy that encourages investment \nand manufacturing in America--not penalize companies and their owners \nfor doing business.\n                     tax reform for all businesses\n    A January 2015 industry survey by the Precision Metalforming \nAssociation and National Tooling and Machining Association showed that \n61% of companies are structured as a pass-through business, often \npaying income taxes at the higher individual rates. Sector-wide, 81% of \nall manufacturing companies are structured as pass-throughs, meaning C-\nCorporation only reform would leave behind eight in ten manufacturers, \nmost small and medium-sized family-owned businesses. We are one of \nthose millions of manufacturers Corporate-only reform would leave \nbehind.\n    Batesville Tool and Die is structured as an S-Corporation. As a \nmulti-generational manufacturing company with strong ties to the \ncommunity, over the years our company has awarded shares to certain \nemployees and family members. Maybe we've been overly generous in the \npast, but we now have 72 shareholders. We are not your typical \nmanufacturing pass-through, which in our industry tends to average 3-5 \nshareholders. However, being a pass-through allows us to reward \nemployees with shares in the company without the penalty of double \ntaxation that a C-Corporation structure brings.\n    The main reason most family-owned or tightly held manufacturers \nstructure themselves as pass-throughs is so they can keep the company \nwithin the family. Underscoring this point is that many in our industry \nare nearing their retirement and planning to pass the business along to \nthe third or fourth generation of manufacturers. If our company was a \nC-Corporation, when I'm set to retire, the tax penalties just on my \nportion alone would mean I'd have to plan years ahead how to cover the \ndividend tax rate - even if I knew what it was ahead of time.\n    Unfortunately, I'm still a ways away from retiring, but think what \nwould happen to these 72 small shareholders if we sold the company--\nsome of them are retirees in their eighties while others are high \nschool students. How would they come up with the resources to pay the \nincome and dividend taxes were we structured as a C-Corporation?\n    While there are many benefits to our pass-through structure, the \nmain drawback is the most obvious--Congress raised our rates a few \nyears ago. While publicly most believe the top rate is 39.6%, in \nreality we pay roughly 43.4% in federal income taxes when you calculate \nthe surcharges and other additions. Keep in mind we have 72 \nshareholders, with one drawing fully passive income. This means we are \nwithholding 43.4% from all of their taxes and leaving it up to the \nindividual shareholder to seek a refund if their overall income levels \ndo not reach the highest brackets. More importantly, that is money \ntaken out of the business to pay taxes on their behalf and even if the \nindividual receives a refund, the company will never see any of that \nmoney again--valuable resources we could have used to invest in the \nbusiness.\n    As Washington contemplates tax reform, I asked our CFO to explore \nhow various scenarios affect our company. Based on current tax law and \nafter deductions and credits, Batesville Tool and Die paid roughly $1.6 \nmillion in taxes. Had the individual tax rate not increased to 39.6%, \nwe would have paid $1.1 million in taxes using the same figures. If the \nrate is reduced to 28% and the key investment provisions are kept in \nplace, our tax liability drops to $928,000, freeing up $700,000 to \ninvest in the business, more if lowered to 25%.\n    This is where public perception plays a big role. The average \nperson and politician would assume the owners pocket that $700,000. In \nreality, that is not the way small and medium-sized manufacturers \noperate. In the metalworking industry, our profit margins are typically \n1-3%. The cost of manufacturing in America is not cheap and we use \nevery resource available to make ourselves more globally competitive \nthrough investing in new technologies and hiring skilled workers.\n    Furthermore, what many people do not know is most small business \nowners have to personally guarantee loans for the company when buying \nequipment that can cost in the millions. The fewer resources our \nlenders see in the business, combined with the higher personal tax \nliability for each shareholder, often leads to increased borrowing \nrates and stricter terms. Small and medium-sized manufacturing \nbusinesses rarely self-finance, and with a 1-3% profit margin we are \nnot the most attractive borrower in the best of circumstances.\n            tax credits and deductions used by manufacturers\n    Every manufacturing business is different and each company serves a \nvariety of industries which have varying needs requiring specialty \nequipment. Some of our equipment can cost $2-10 million, much of which \nwe could not afford without Bonus Depreciation. For others the R&D Tax \nCredit is worth hundreds of thousands as opposed to general deductions.\n    While traveling the country as Chairman of the PMA last year, I \nheard from countless manufacturers that they are holding back \ninvestments because they do not know whether Congress will extend \ncritical tax provisions. The recent association survey of our industry \nshowed that 91% of metalworking manufacturers claimed Section 179 \nEquipment Expensing in 2014. An equally impressive 89% used Bonus \nDepreciation while roughly half claimed the R&D Tax Credit. This \nJanuary, Congress allowed the R&D credit to lapse for the sixteenth \ntime, Bonus Depreciation to expire, and 179 to revert to $25,000, \nrendering it completely useless for manufacturers like us.\n    To our company, the R&D and Bonus are by far the most important. We \nclaimed $544,000 in R&D and while that was among a peak year for us, we \nsee this provision as one of the few in our tax code that actually \nincentivizes manufacturing in America. I know many smaller companies \nshy away from the R&D as not being worth their time to defend in an \naudit. Some will say they cannot substantiate the $20,000 in expenses \nto claim $40,000 in R&D credits. But at Batesville, our exposure to the \nR&D is significant, so I guess we will just have to keep the faith in \nCongress that you will extend or make permanent the R&D, I just ask \nthat you don't wait until the eleventh hour this time.\n    Bonus Depreciation really is a game changer for manufacturers who \ninvest heavily in equipment and talented people to run them. Had \nCongress not extended Bonus Depreciation in December of last year, \ncountless manufacturers in the metalworking industry would have faced \nan average $400,000 tax liability due in 2015. The typical small \nmanufacturer does not have that kind of cash on hand and would \neliminate 2015 purchases and hiring to pay the added tax liability.\n    However, before Congress pats themselves on the back for a job well \ndone, extending expired provisions in November and December each year \nclearly stunts economic growth. Machines in our industry take eight \nweeks to eighteen months to place into service. This makes it \nimpossible for the average manufacturer to benefit from Bonus \nDepreciation or Section 179 Equipment Expensing extended on December 11 \nwith only three weeks to finance, purchase, and place into service \nmachinery weighing several thousand tons.\n    The other real world impact of Congressional inaction was witnessed \nfirsthand at Batesville Tool and Die last year. Due to the uncertainty \nover whether Congress would extend the R&D, Bonus and other key tax \nprovisions, we overpaid our quarterly estimates to account for a \npotential massive tax liability if the provisions remained expired for \n2014. This meant we overpaid our taxes by $580,303 because lawmakers \nwaited until a lame duck Congressional session before acting. While our \nemployees and other shareholders benefit from this structure, it causes \nsignificant challenges for the business when we have to overpay based \non which tax credits and provisions Congress keeps in place.\n    As a pass-through, we pay the taxes for our shareholders quarterly \nbased on estimates of revenue and existing tax law. This meant that \nlast year we withheld roughly 44% from each shareholder for income \ntaxes and overpaid on their behalf based on not knowing which tax \nprovisions Congress would put in place for the taxable year. The \nindividual shareholders will receive a refund for the overpayments on \ntheir personal tax returns, but they will never give that money back to \nthe business who overpaid on their behalf. This means, the company will \nnever see that $580,000 again. With over half a million dollars I could \nhire seven or eight new employees or purchase a new machine that would \nhave also required new workers. Instead, we sent that money to \nWashington, who will just turn it around and give to it the \nindividuals, while the small business is left footing the bill.\n    Comprehensive tax reform would immediately fix this problem. Our \ncompany would know the rules at the beginning of the year and withhold \nor pay the appropriate estimate. But the current system is like \nshooting a moving target, but never giving you a chance to lock on. \nAbsent comprehensive tax reform, we need Congress to make permanent \nthese investment provisions or at least extend them for a significant \nnumber of years. As I mentioned earlier, some of our equipment takes \neighteen months or longer to place into service and our planning \nprocess is often two to ten years as we anticipate future growth.\n    The Alternative Minimum Tax, or AMT, is another issue which \nreceives attention from politicians when discussing tax reform. The \nreach of the AMT is much broader than just affecting the ``middle \nclass.'' When a business is captured under the AMT, they cannot claim \nthe Research and Development Tax Credit, which would be available to \nthem and is so popular among lawmakers. In addition, an AMT captured \nbusiness could not benefit from the politically popular $1,000 credit \nfor hiring the long-term unemployed. Again, this is why we need \ncomprehensive reform, the Internal Revenue Code is riddled with \noutdated and conflicting provisions stifling U.S. companies and \ndeterring foreign investment.\n                               conclusion\n    In towns such as Batesville, Indiana with a population of 6,500, \nthe community needs employers like us but we need a partner in \nWashington that sets the rules and sticks with them. Manufacturers of \nall sizes need time to plan. We may not be a billion-dollar company but \nbusinesses in our industry routinely spend millions each year to remain \ncompetitive. Virtually every other industrialized nation has a tax code \nthat fosters innovation and encourages investment. It is time the U.S. \nGovernment caught up to the rest of the world the way its manufacturers \nhave.\n    Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today on this \nimportant issue.\n                               __________"
"policy","Ms. Holly Wade, Director of Research and Policy","ceo,","Jody Fledderman, President & CEO,","         Analysis, National Federation of Independent Business\n    Good morning Chairman Coats, Vice Chairwoman Maloney and members of \nthe Joint Economic Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify \ntoday. I am pleased to be here on behalf of the National Federation of \nIndependent Business (NFIB) as the Committee discusses small business, \ntax policy and economic growth in the small-business sector. NFIB is \nthe nation's leading small business advocacy organization representing \nover 350,000 small-business owners across the country. NFIB represents \nbusinesses in most industries and of various sizes, with about 80 \npercent under 40 employees.\n    The small business economy is slowly emerging from one of the worst \nrecessions in U.S. history. NFIB's monthly Small Business Economic \nTrends (SBET) survey data shows the dramatic change in consumer \nspending, employment, owner's confidence and business investments \nthroughout the recession and subsequent recovery.\\1\\ While some \nbusiness activities have made significant improvement over the past \nfour years, capital expenditures and outlook on business conditions and \nexpansion remain at historically low levels due to economic conditions \nand the political climate. The threat of higher taxes whether in the \nform of income taxes, the healthcare law, the estate tax, section 179 \nexpensing limits, or others creates enormous uncertainty among small-\nbusiness owners worried about the impact of policy changes on future \nbusiness costs.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\1\\ Dunkelberg, William C., and Holly Wade, NFIB Small Business \nEconomic Trends, NFIB Research Foundation, series.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    The SBET survey also tracks which problems most affect owners in \noperating their small businesses. From mid-2008 through mid-2012, \n``poor sales'' was their number one problem as consumer spending \ndeclined sharply. But now ``taxes'' is often the number one concern for \nsmall-business owners, a problem that moderates the economic recovery \nin the small-business sector.\n    The NFIB Small Business Problems and Priorities survey highlights \nthree main areas of tax policy that are of great concern to small-\nbusiness owners.\\2\\ The survey is of a random sample of NFIB members \nasking them to evaluate 75 potential small-business problems and assess \nthe severity of each. The problems are then ranked by their mean score. \nWith the ``Cost of Health Insurance'' leading as the most severe \nproblem for small-business owners, five of the top 10 problems are all \ntax-related. These tax problems fall into three categories: cost, \ncomplexity and frequent changes.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\2\\ Wade, Holly, Small Business Problems and Priorities, NFIB \nResearch Foundation, 2012.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    The cost of tax obligations is threefold; the amount paid to \nfederal, state and local tax agencies, the cost of hiring a CPA or tax \nadvisor to navigate complex tax codes, and the owner's time in \nproviding the required paperwork and/or filing themselves. Eighty-eight \npercent of small employers use a tax preparer, and most use one to \neither ensure compliance or because the requirements are too complex. \nTax-related regulations cause the greatest difficulties for 40 percent \nof small employers, more than environmental, health and safety, or \nemployee-related regulations.\\3\\ And compliance costs are especially \nproblematic for small-business owners as they are 67 percent higher for \nsmall businesses than for their larger counterparts, costing them $18-\n19 billion per year, or about $74 per hour.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\3\\ Dennis, William J., Tax Complexity and the IRS, NFIB Research \nFoundation, Volume 6, Issue 6, 2006.\n    \\4\\ https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/rs343.pdf\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Tax-related costs compete with owners' ability to use limited \nprofits for primary business activities. Profits are the main funding \nmechanism for owners purchasing new equipment, expanding facilities, \nhiring and stocking inventory. Tax-related cost pressures are \nespecially problematic for newer firms that almost solely rely on \nprofits for operation and expansion costs as they are generally not \nable to access traditional lending sources. Banks almost exclusively \nlend to more established firms, not new ones due to higher failure \nrates. But regardless of the firm's age, tax burdens take a heavy toll \non owners' ability to operate their businesses.\n    One example that encapsulates all three categories of tax-related \nproblems for small-business owners is the Affordable Care Act (ACA). \nThe employer mandate, small-business tax credit, and the termination of \nemployer reimbursements are just a few of the many tax-related costs \nand complications small-business owners face in complying with the new \nlaw.\n    The cost of health insurance is the most critical issue facing \nsmall-business owners. It is the main reason owners do not offer \nemployer-sponsored health insurance and the main reason owners \ndiscontinue providing the benefit.\\5\\ But the employer mandate does not \ntake into consideration the cost issue as it requires all employers \nwith 50 or more full time equivalents to offer health insurance or pay \na tax for not offering.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\5\\ Dennis, William J., Small Business's Introduction to the \nAffordable Care Act Part II, NFIB Research Foundation, December 2014.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    The employer mandate pressures offering firms to continue \nregardless of profitability and penalizes firms for not offering, \nregardless of their financial situation. Firms with high employee \nturnover, seasonal employment and lower profit margins are less likely \nto offer health insurance. But now, those with 50 or more full time \nequivalents must absorb an additional tax for not offering, offer \nincreasingly expensive health insurance, or limit employment--all less \nthan optimal options.\n    The employer mandate also contributes to increased tax complexity \ndue to the often ambiguous and complicated aggregation rules associated \nwith calculating the number of full time equivalent employees. The \npaperwork associated in calculating employee hours as they relate to \nthe mandate reduces the most valuable asset of the owner, his or her \ntime. And the aggregation rules will be most difficult for owners with \nseasonal employees, high employee turnover or own more than one \nemployer firm. The IRS estimates that it will take over 4 hours to fill \nout the required forms, acknowledging that these estimates will vary \ndue to individual circumstances. For firms with more complicated \nemployment structures, the time commitment required will likely be far \ngreater.\\6\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\6\\ http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i109495c.pdf\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Small-business owners have also encountered repeated delays and \nconfusion over the ACA's small-business health insurance tax credit and \nfinancial reimbursement options. The tax credit is a targeted approach \nto help curb health insurance costs for offering small employers and is \nintended to provide an incentive for those that do not, to start \noffering. However, the tax credit is largely ineffective on both fronts \nas its design is exceedingly restrictive, complicated, and only offers \ntemporary relief to a larger small business cost problem. The tax \ncredit now serves as a windfall for the few who qualify and take the \ntime, or pay an accountant, to file for it. The IRS estimates that it \nwill take over 15 hours to understand, complete and submit the \nappropriate forms.\\7\\ The paperwork costs involved in filing for the \ntax credit will likely yield little benefit at the end of the day. \nThese problems are not an uncommon fate for many tax credits including \nthose trying to increase hiring and car sales. Generally these types of \nincentives only benefit those already committed to the activity and are \nwilling fill out the required paperwork or pay someone to do it for \nthem.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\7\\ http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8941.pdf\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Another ACA tax burden that falls into the frequent changes \ncategory is the termination of employer reimbursements for individually \npurchased health insurance plans by their employees. A recent NFIB \nsurvey found that about 18 percent of small employers offered this \nbenefit last year and are now in violation of the law. NFIB continues \nto receive calls from owners, generally after having talked to their \nCPA or insurance agent, confused about the new rules prohibiting the \npractice and the subsequent harsh tax penalties. It is very likely many \nsmall employers are still not aware of this change in policy and will \nbe notified of its termination in the form of a letter from the IRS \nrequiring payment of excessive penalties.\n    The ACA is just one example of how excessive tax burdens affect \nsmall-business owners. And the federal tax code is only one layer of \ntax obligations owners face in operating their business. They must also \ncomply with state and local taxes adding to the overall compliance \nburden. Unfortunately, only the owner experiences the cumulative effect \nof all the required taxes and regulations places on their business. \nFederal, state and local lawmakers and government agencies only see \nthem in isolation, giving a false perception of their true impact. But \nit's the responsibility of the business owner to manage them all while \ntrying to operate a profitable, successful business.\n    In conclusion, small-business owners continue to be excessively \nburdened by direct, indirect, complicated and ever changing taxes \nrelated to operating their business. Alleviating the excessive tax \nburden on small businesses is an essential component in creating a \nstrong, healthy environment for owners to operate and grow their \nbusiness. I appreciate the opportunity to present NFIB's views and data \non the effects of tax policies on small businesses. I look forward to \nanswering any questions you might have.\n                               __________"
"and","Thomas A. Hoghaug, CEO, Signus Medical, LLC, and","policy","Ms. Holly Wade, Director of Research and Policy","                      CEO, LockDown Surgical, Inc.\n    Chairman Coats, Vice-Chairman Brady, Ranking Member Maloney, \nSenator Klobuchar and Representative Paulsen, I would like to thank you \nfor this opportunity to testify. My name is Thomas Hoghaug and I \ncurrently hold the position of CEO for Signus Medical, LLC, and \nLockDown Surgical, Inc. It is an honor for me to be able to address \nthis committee today and potentially shed some light on the extremely \nnegative impact the Medical Device Tax has had on both of my companies \nand on similar small medical device firms. The issues and examples I \nwill share are personal examples that are in no way unique to Signus \nMedical and LockDown Surgical. They are common experiences shared by a \nmultitude of smaller device firms and have been conveyed and confirmed \nto me during meetings, committees and gatherings of medical device \nexecutives. Small device firms are primarily responsible for the \nmajority of innovation and development of better and more cost \neffective treatment modalities for patient care in the U.S.\n    I have worked in the orthopedic medical device arena for over 27 \nyears with extensive experience in both international and domestic \nproduct sales and distribution. Over the course of my career I have \nfounded seven (7) medical device companies, the largest being \nCalifornia based Alphatec Inc., and assisted others in achieving \ncritical sales mass in order to go public. The most notable being \nMinneapolis based Spine-Tech Inc. which is considered to be the most \nsuccessful IPO and ultimate acquisition target in the orthopedic \nindustry. In 2002, I acquired sole ownership of Signus Medical, LLC, a \nmaster importer, developer and distributor of spinal implants. In June \nof 2014 I accepted the concurrent position of CEO of LockDown Surgical \nInc; an extremity company focused on joint ligament repair. LockDown \nSurgical was founded in February of 2012 with a single FDA cleared \nproduct for shoulder repair. It has been operating at an annual \nfinancial loss and expects to reach breakeven and finally begin to turn \na modest profit in the fourth quarter of this year. It wound have been \nsooner if it were not for the device tax.\n    Since the economic disaster of 2008, the spinal implant industry \nhas been one of the hardest hit in terms of downward pricing pressure, \nFDA clearance delays and regulatory scrutiny. We have seen end user \npricing drop in excess of 70% , while the burden of compliance and \nreporting has increased dramatically. Signus Medical has managed to \nweather these storms but not without a negative impact on its top line \nsales and net profit.\n    With the introduction and implementation of the Affordable Care \nAct's Medical Device Tax, companies have experienced a multitude of \nunforeseen and crippling consequences of the tax including: layoffs, \nnon-replacement of lost employees, disrupted or negative cash-flow, \ncurtailing or elimination of R & D projects, reduced inventory \nexpansion and effective tax rates which can exceed 100% of profit. \nMoney that was once used to grow and reinvest in the expansion of the \ncompanies is now sent to the IRS every two (2) weeks. The AdvaMed \nresponse to the November 3, 2014 Congressional Research Service reports \nthat these payments are in fact used in the Nation's general revenue \nstream and not used for healthcare reform under the ACA as was \npromised.\n    From the time of our first device tax payments the impact was felt \nimmediately. We are required to pay the 2.3% tax on all invoiced sales \napproximately every two (2) weeks. This tax is assessed on all device \nsales billed within the previous two (2) weeks irrespective of profit, \nprofitability, cash-flow or collections. At present, our collections \naverage about 72 days from the date of surgery yet we are compelled to \npay the IRS within 14 days or less. As a result, we are fronting the \ntax payment nearly 50 days in advance of actually collecting payment \nfor our implanted devices. Representing two small device companies as I \ndo, I was forced to lay off several employees in order to cover the \ninitial shortfall and when several more key support personnel were lost \nthrough the course of normal job advancement, I no longer have the \ninvestment capital to re-hire those positions. Both Signus Medical and \nLockDown Surgical are privately held businesses with very close-knit \ngroups of employees. One of the hardest tasks I have ever had to \nperform in my 27 year career is to personally layoff employees who have \nperformed their jobs admirably, have families and homes of their own, \nemployer paid healthcare, financial obligations and commitments based \nupon the strong wages and benefits we were able to provide. Solely and \nfor no other reason but to pay for the Medical Device Tax. To date we \nhave experienced a nearly 25% reduction in our staff and I see no near \nor long term opportunity to replace them while this tax is in effect. I \nhave had to implement a wage freeze since 2012 as the device tax cut \ninto the profits and ultimately took more than 100% of both company's \nprofits in 2014.\n    The payment terms and concept of what is essentially a 2.3% excise \ntax was, in my opinion, ill-conceived. The tax is on gross sales, \ncannot be passed on to consumers, is non-deductible and does not take \ninto consideration the profitability or financial status of the \ncompany. In respect to LockDown Surgical, being a startup company, we \nhave had to actually finance the device tax in addition to financing \nall of the initial costs associated with setting up and rolling out a \nnew company and product. Investors look at the negative impact of the \ndevice tax; see how it pushes out the point of breakeven by literally \nyears and are extremely hesitant to invest capital knowing much of it \nwill be siphoned off to pay for a tax instead of used to grow and \ndevelop a company and new treatment therapies. No other industry is \nburdened with this government imposed barrier to market. Make no \nmistake it is a very real impediment to investment as was highlighted \nby a number of surveys conducted by LifeScience Alley, the Medical \nDevice Manufacturers Association (MDMA) and AdvaMed. While presenting \nto Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton's Economic Round Table Forum in 2013, \nI expressed real alarm that the then effective tax rate on Signus \nMedical due to the device tax was 82%. Governor Dayton's financial \nadvisor addressed my concerns by asking me, ``Why on earth would you \nwant to be in any business with such a high tax rate? I would never be \nin one.'' My response after the incredulous shock of that comment was \nthat I have been in the spinal market since 2001. Our company has made \ncommitments to providing the best treatment options to surgeons and \npatient care, providing our employees and their families with well-\npaying jobs and benefits. This company is my investment in my own \nfuture as well. Prior to 2012, the corporate playing field was \nessentially even and all companies just had to deal with some of the \nhighest corporate tax rates in the world. I certainly didn't chose to \nself- impose this excise tax on my companies.\n    To help put this in perspective, our CFO provided me with some very \nbasic accounting examples of the impact of the tax. I am by no means a \ntax expert, but as CEO I am legally liable for all financial reporting \nand tax submissions. As such, I can certainly navigate through \ncorporate Profit and Loss Statements and can clearly assess the impact \nthe Medical Device Tax has on corporate bottom lines. In former times, \npre device tax, a small company with $8,000,000 in sales and an average \n6% pre-tax income would show a modest $480,000 pre-tax profit. Using \nthe National average state corporate tax rate of 8.5% or $40,800 \ncombined with the Federal Tax Rate of 35% on the adjusted taxable \nincome or $153,720 it would result in a total of $194,520 in taxes \npaid; the Net Income After Tax would be $285,480 which could be used to \nexpand the business, service debt or develop new products. That \nrepresented a 40.5% effective tax rate. Now, add in the 2.3% Medical \nDevice Tax on gross sales of $184,000 and the total taxes paid on the \nsame revenue dollars jumps to $378,520 resulting in a Net Income After \nTax of $101,480 or in other words a 78.9% effective tax rate, which is \na 94.6% increase in taxes and far less capital to reinvest.\n    Next, extend this same scenario to a startup or loss company and \nthe effects are even more dramatic. A pre-device tax company with the \nsame $8.000,000 in sales and a modest -2% loss of -$160,000 would only \nbe subject to the average 1.5% of various State minimum taxes of \n$2,400. Total Net Loss After Tax would be a -$162,400. With the \naddition of the Medical Device Tax, this startup or loss company is \nliable for the same $184,000 as the profitable company; its total tax \nliability is now $186,400 thus resulting in a Net -$346,400 loss. This \nloss, including the device tax, has to be financed somehow and pushes \nout breakeven and profitability. There is no return on investment when \none is financing a government tax and fewer investors are willing to \ntake on this financial burden. Furthermore, the Device Tax loss is not \ndeductible and is therefore lost to any kind of recovery forever. The \nfollowing page contains a simplistic visual example of the deleterious \neffect of this tax.\n    Another perhaps unforeseen but very significant impact of the \nMedical Device Tax is disruption of both of my companies' cash-flow. As \nmentioned earlier, payments are made within 2 weeks of posting sales \nbut collections are running upwards of 70 days. These payments strip \nboth firms of ready cash which was previously used for day to day \noperations, payroll and payments to vendors. Since 2012, our monthly \ncash-flow has been negative due to the tax and we have slowly used up \nall cash reserves and creative reductions of inventory to now find \nourselves in arrears with suppliers. Banks and investors are clearly \naware of the effects of this tax and are reluctant to extend lines of \ncredit or further loans citing no desire to finance government taxes. \nAs of last year, I shelved two major R&D projects because I could not \nguarantee that cash, which at one time was budgeted and deemed \navailable, would in truth actually be available. Instead, we are \nlooking at how we will simply manage through the cost of introducing \nseveral new products in 2015 which would, under pre-device tax \nconditions and expectations, return Signus Medical to nominal \nprofitability and expand LockDown Surgical products into other areas of \nthe body where there is a very real and significant patient need.\n    I am very proud to be actively involved in the medical device \narena. It has historically been a shining star in the US economy and \nhas supported some of the highest paying jobs when compared to all \nother business sectors and average wages. The advancements in treatment \nand improved patient outcomes is commonly a direct result of smaller \nand more nimble device companies, such as Signus Medical and LockDown \nSurgical, reinvesting profits and resources into the development of new \nand more cost effective surgical and non-surgical solutions. What many \nare unaware of, however, is the very high physical cost of supporting \neach and every case performed on a daily basis across this huge nation \nof ours. Using spinal surgery as an example, Signus Medical must supply \nthe hospital and surgeon sufficient implants and redundant backup \ninventory to address every potential size and possible complication one \nmight face in surgery. Literally dozens of implants, like shoes in a \nshoe store, must be provided in order to actually implant and sell only \none device and the cost of this inventory is born by the company. \nHospitals no longer purchase or stock specialty instruments and \nimplants so they must be shipped in and tracked for every single case. \nThe FDA and HIPAA compliance burden for the location of each and every \nimplant, their corresponding lot numbers, all associated instrument \nsets and ultimately which implants are used is staggering for a company \nof any size. The costs associated with increasing even one surgical \ncustomer are so significant that it may take many months to upwards of \na year just to recoup the investment of the supporting implants and \ninstrumentation. We at Signus have become a model of ``Just In Time'' \nshipping and inventory control in order to work around the much needed \nexpansion capital which has been used instead to pay the device tax. \nEfficiency alone has its limits and I have been faced with the \nunenviable choice of slowing or turning down business to ensure patient \nsafety. Patients, their safety and surgical outcomes are a priority \nshared by all medical device companies. This is something I will not \nand cannot compromise on.\n    With the inclusion of the Medical Device Tax into the 2014 \noperational budgets, both Signus Medical and LockDown Surgical posted \neffective tax rates in excess of 110%. This is not sustainable for any \nbusiness, large or small. I fear once again I will be facing employee \ndownsizing and further elimination of development projects and thus new \nclinical therapies to patients in the United States in order to just \nremain in business and pay the device tax. Even as the business \nimproves, so do the pre-payment of device taxes and it is extremely \ndifficult to actually ever catch up. Money required for reinvesting in \nexpanded infrastructure including employees, new inventory and \npromising R&D projects is no longer available. Again, these problems \nare not unique to my two companies and are clearly felt across the \nentire medical device industry. I do believe however that smaller and \nstartup companies are more severely impacted by the device tax given \ntheir inherent size and inability to spread or defer to cost over non-\ndevice products being sold by larger and more vertically integrated \ncompanies.\n    In conclusion I would like to thank Chairman Coats, Vice-Chairman \nBrady, Ranking Member Maloney, Senator Klobuchar and Representative \nPaulsen for this opportunity to testify before this committee. I \nsincerely hope that the information and personal experiences I have \nshared help to enlighten you as to the true negative impact the ACA's \nMedical Device Tax has had on the Medical Device Industry as a whole \nand smaller and startup companies like Signus Medical LLC, and LockDown \nSurgical Inc in particular. Growth, innovation and new job creation \ncome from small medical device firms. The Medical Device Tax threatens \nto kill off or at the very least considerably curtail this segment of \nour industry."

The highly dynamic nature of new, young firms \nis an essential component to the economy as a whole, as employment in \nmature small and large firms tends to be more constant.

Census data shows that new firms accounted \nfor about 16 percent of total firms in the late 1970s. However, that \nshare had declined to 8 percent in 2011.
