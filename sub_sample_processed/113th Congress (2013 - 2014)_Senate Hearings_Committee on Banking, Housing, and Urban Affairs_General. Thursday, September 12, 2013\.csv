"crapo","Senator Crapo","","","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. There seems to be \nmore traction toward moving forward with housing reform than \nthere has been at any point during the 5-year conservatorships \nof Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Mr. Chairman, thank you for \nmaking this a top priority of the Committee during this \nCongress.\n    In March of this year, this subject became one of our first \nhearings, and now I look forward to working toward a solution \nwith you and all of the Senators of this Committee.\n    Many other people deserve credit for getting the ball \nmoving and getting it going forward well on this important \ntopic. Senators Corker and Warner and all of the cosponsors of \ntheir bill have worked collaboratively in developing a proposal \nthat will help shape our debate as we move forward, and I thank \nthem and their staffs for their hard work.\n    Senator Reed also has put a tremendous amount of work into \nhelping us get toward the right answers and the right \nlegislative language, and there are many other Senators on this \nCommittee who may not have introduced legislation but who have \nput a tremendous amount of thought and effort into the issue \nbehind the scenes advocating for a resolution.\n    Chairman Hensarling likewise deserves a lot of credit and \nour thanks for his work in moving a proposal out of the House \nFinancial Services Committee. In fact, given the President's \nrecent comments, it appears we now are experiencing the first \nmoment since the crisis that the White House, the Senate, and \nthe House are all moving forward or advocating for reform.\n    Given this circumstance, we must use this opportunity to \nconcentrate on building consensus around ending the \nconservatorships while building a stable secondary market that \nbrings back private capital and avoids repeating the mistakes \nof the past.\n    As I noted, a tremendous amount of work on this topic has \nalready been done by many of the Committee's Senators, and we \nmust not lose this momentum.\n    As such, the Banking Committee intends to hold a series of \nhearings to gain insight from experts, regulators, and \nstakeholders to ensure that the Committee moves forward in an \neducated fashion. These hearings will provide a more in-depth \nanalysis of some of the necessary components of reform with a \ngoal of marking up a bipartisan bill by the end of the year.\n    There will be costs and tradeoffs associated with every \ndecision that we make. As we evaluate those tradeoffs, I am \npleased to have before us a panel that represents decades of \nreal experience and study of our mortgage markets. I look \nforward to hearing from the witnesses, gaining their input and \nanalysis about what are the essential elements of any reform. \nIt will also be helpful to hear what questions we need to be \nasking to arrive at the best solutions.\n    Despite the tough decisions that lie ahead, our task is \nvital. For more than 5 years, our housing finance system has \nremained in limbo, unable to innovate or even function outside \nof a massive Government intervention. In those 5 years, we have \nseen other financial markets recover while watching the housing \nmarket remain stagnant. During those same 5 years, we watched \nthe bill to the American taxpayers rise to nearly $200 billion \nwhile simultaneously creating numerous legal questions that our \ncourts may be sorting out for years to come. This cannot be \nallowed to continue.\n    Chairman Johnson and I were able to work together with the \nother Senators on the Banking Committee to pass the Federal \nHousing Administration Solvency Act of 2013 out of Committee \nwith a large, bipartisan vote. As a Committee, we must re-\ncreate that consensus while turning our full attention to \nreforming the Government-sponsored entities and our broader \nhousing finance market.\n    Hopefully our past work and the further collaborating of \nour Senators has engendered a level of trust and good will that \ncan lead this Committee to a strong product with an equally \nstrong level of support.\n    Mr. Chairman, again I thank you, and I look forward to \nworking with you and all Members of the Committee as we move \nforward.\n    Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Senator Crapo.\n    Are there any other Members who would like to give a brief \nopening statement? Senator Tester."

break,break,break,break
"","","tester","Senator Tester","    Ms. Gordon. Good morning, Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member \nCrapo, and Members of the Committee. Thank you so much for \ninviting me to testify today. I am Julia Gordon, director of \nhousing finance and policy at the Center for American Progress \nand convener of the Mortgage Finance Working Group, which \nreleased a comprehensive reform plan back in January of 2011 \nand has been meeting weekly since then to study the future of \nhousing finance.\n    We stand at a critical inflection point for our Nation's \nhousing finance system. While housing prices have begun to \nrecover in many parts of the country, the fundamentals are not \nyet strong. The mortgage market today is significantly smaller \nthan it was in the early 2000s. Two-thirds of originations are \nrefinancings rather than home purchases. And much recent price \nappreciation can be attributed to cash investors.\n    In the meantime, the demographics that represent the future \nof home ownership, such as first-time home buyers, millennials, \nand people of color, have largely been shut out of the \nconventional mortgage market.\n    Production of apartment units is falling behind demand, and \nrents have risen significantly, with more than a quarter of all \nrenters spending more than half of their income on housing. In \nour view, the status quo no longer serves the American public's \nbest interests, and it is time to reform the system.\n    We are pleased to see a broad consensus emerging on the \ngeneral outlines of housing finance reform that we must have a \nGovernment backstop behind private capital, that the long-term \nfixed-rate mortgage is a crucial product for families \ninterested in home ownership, that the system must include not \njust single-family but also multi-family finance, and that the \nsystem provide access to all creditworthy borrowers and lenders \nof all sizes.\n    I commend Senators Corker and Warner for pushing this \ndebate forward. By recognizing this consensus and developing a \nstrong bipartisan framework for reform, they have done a true \npublic service.\n    However, we still have a great deal of work ahead of us to \nadjust and fill in this framework so that it will work well for \nall borrowers, all lenders, and all investors throughout all \neconomic cycles.\n    First and foremost, a new housing finance system must place \nthe Nation's housing needs at the center of the system. The \nstructures and processes of the secondary market are not ends \nin and of themselves. Providing broad access to affordable, \nsustainable credit will provide the greatest benefit in the \nlong run not only to families but also to lenders and investors \nwhile protecting taxpayers from future bailouts.\n    The system must provide a level playing field for all \ncreditworthy borrowers in all geographic areas for all housing \ntypes and for lenders of all sizes. Additionally, it needs the \ncapacity to help more families obtain mortgages in the \nconventional market through credit supports and safe innovation \nrather than relegating large swaths of borrowers to FHA \nunnecessarily, where mortgages are more expensive and where the \nGovernment will continue to provide a 100-percent guarantee. \nAnd to serve those families not yet ready for or interested in \nhome ownership, the system should provide financing to preserve \nexisting privately owned affordable housing stock and support \nthe construction of new affordable units.\n    To create a deep liquid market and support widespread \navailability of a long-term fixed-rate mortgage product, we \nneed both a Government guarantee and a healthy TBA market. We \nagree that there is no reason for the Government to guarantee \n100 percent of the risk, and in our 2011 proposal we suggested \nthat chartered bond guarantors stand in the first loss \nposition, which is one of the options presented in the Corker-\nWarner bill.\n    However, we have significant concerns about the other \noption presented in that bill, which is having issuers lay off \nthe risk directly through the private capital markets. We are \nconcerned that structured transactions alone cannot effectively \nmaintain the TBA market, provide broad access to sustainable \ncredit, protect the taxpayer, and maintain access to credit \nthroughout economic cycles. We expect, though, that bond \nguarantors will access the capital markets to lay off risk, \nperhaps along the lines of the Freddie STACR deal.\n    It perhaps goes without saying, but any new system also \nmust support effective and fair mortgage servicing practices as \nwell as appropriate systems to provide clarity regarding \nproperty title.\n    Finally, we need strong regulatory tools to ensure safety \nand soundness throughout the system, including examination, \nsupervision, and enforcement authority for entities accessing \nthe Government guarantee.\n    Thank you again for inviting me to testify today, and I \nlook forward to continued discussion on these important matters \nas the Senate moves forward on housing finance reform \nlegislation.\n    Chairman Johnson. Thank you.\n    Mr. Lienhard, you may proceed."

"","","tester","Senator Tester","    Mr. Lienhard. Good morning, Chairman Johnson, Ranking \nMember Crapo, and Members of the Banking Committee. I am Jerome \nLienhard, president and CEO of SunTrust Mortgage, which is a \nsubsidiary of SunTrust Banks. Thank you for allowing me to \nparticipate in the consideration of this important subject.\n    I am appearing today in my capacity at SunTrust Mortgage, \nand this testimony was prepared after consultation with the \nRegional Bank Group, an informal coalition of mid-sized lending \ninstitutions located throughout the United States. All views \nexpressed today, however, are my own.\n    SunTrust is headquartered in Atlanta and operates mainly in \nthe southeastern United States. SunTrust Mortgage is based in \nRichmond, Virginia, and employs about 4,300 teammates. Last \nyear, we originated over $32 billion in mortgage loans which \nhelped more than 120,000 of our clients purchase a home or \nlower their monthly payment through refinancing.\n    Today I would like to make two important points from the \nperspective of a regional bank:\n    First, while there is a need to reform the housing finance \nsystem, it is critical to retain the basic ``plumbing'' of the \nsystem that draws in enormous sums of investment capital and \nprovides borrowers with interest rate certainty. These features \ncan be retained in a mortgage market that serves both the \ninterests of borrowers and taxpayers alike.\n    Second, reform must bring more private capital into the \nmortgage market in a principal loss position without reducing \nthe global demand for mortgage-backed securities and while \nprotecting competitive access for small and medium-sized \ninstitutions that serve millions of homeowners.\n    I will spend a few minutes elaborating on each of these \npoints.\n    Out of thousands of mortgage loans that we make each year, \non average we hold only one in six on our balance sheet. So \nwhile we own approximately $30 billion worth of mortgage loans, \nwe actually originated and service more than $140 billion in \nmortgages involving more than 800,000 households. This is \npossible for us only due to the existence of the secondary \nmortgage market.\n    To provide our clients with basic information regarding how \nmuch they can afford to pay for a house, we must be able to \ntell them the interest rate and the monthly cost of the loan. \nYou cannot really buy a house if you do not know what your \nmortgage payment will be.\n    We do this by referencing a daily pricing sheet that \nprovides the interest rate and loan terms that we can offer on \na guaranteed basis. These prices are set from the price of \nmortgage-backed securities trading in the ``To Be Announced'' \nor TBA market. The TBA security price assumes delivery of \nconforming mortgages into a Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae mortgage-\nbacked security on a forward basis. This forward-pricing \nmechanism of the secondary market allows us to lock in the \ninterest rates for our clients for up to 90 days.\n    But without that certainty, primary market lenders would be \nunwilling and, frankly, unable to provide forward price \ncertainty to their customers.\n    Through the combination of mortgage standardization and the \nfunction of the MBS market, the existing system provides a \ntangible benefit to borrowers. And these benefits are available \nfor anyone who transact with originators of any size: local \nbanks, Main Street banks such as SunTrust, as well as the \nlargest mortgage originators.\n    While there is a need to address taxpayer risk by making \nstructural changes to the housing finance system, these are key \nfeatures, elements, and processes essential to maintaining a \nsecondary market.\n    Regarding the critical issue of the structure of the credit \nguarantee, our markets perform so well in large part because \ncredit risk associated with mortgage default is assumed by the \nGSEs. Investors from around the world allocate trillions of \ndollars of capital to our markets because it only involves \ninterest rate risk to them.\n    Now, the problem, of course, is that providing credit \nprotection puts taxpayers at risk. Using private sources of \ncapital to cover credit exposure can help alleviate taxpayer \nrisk.\n    We must also consider that if a variety of credit risk \ndevices emerge in place of the relatively simple credit \nguarantee we have today, it could make mortgage-backed \nsecurities difficult for investors to value, fracturing the \ninvestor base, reducing liquidity, and increasing costs. If \nthat market shrinks dramatically, so does lending to \nhomeowners.\n    To the extent that private capital is intended to stand \nbefore any taxpayer-backed guarantees, the entities and \ninstruments must be subject to regulatory oversight. If \nregulators cannot understand nor keep track of the various \nrisk-sharing mechanisms, there is a danger that they will not \nperform as needed under crisis conditions.\n    And, finally, any new source of private sector credit \nprotection should be available for all primary market lenders, \nincluding large, small, and Main Street institutions. Measures \nthat create advantages for the very largest issuers of \nmortgage-backed securities or make the cost of market access \nmore expensive for some and not others will reduce competition \nand must be avoided.\n    Let me conclude by thanking the Committee again for the \ntime, attention, and consideration. I look forward to answering \nany of your questions.\n    Chairman Johnson. Thank you.\n    Mr. Johns, you may proceed."

"","","tester","Senator Tester","  STATEMENT OF RICHARD JOHNS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, STRUCTURED \n                     FINANCE INDUSTRY GROUP"
break,break,break,break
"","","tester","Senator Tester","    Mr. Johns. Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Crapo, and \nMembers of the Committee on Banking, my name is Richard Johns. \nI am the executive director of the Structured Finance Industry \nGroup, or SFIG, a trade industry group that includes over 160 \ncorporate members from all sectors of the securitization \nindustry. On behalf of myself and SFIG's members, I thank you \nfor this opportunity to address the Committee regarding \nproposed housing finance reforms, including the role to be \nplayed by the Government in the housing finance system and the \nimportance of returning private capital to the residential \nmortgage market.\n    SFIG is generally supportive of the framework contained \nSenate bill 1217 and believes the reform process, particularly \nin relation to the securitization markets, must proceed in a \nmeasured and deliberate way. We appreciate the Committee's \nmethodical approach in considering such reforms.\n    A central focus of any reform effort must be the \npreservation of the To Be Announced or TBA market, which is the \nthird most liquid securities market in the world and handles \nover 90 percent of the Government-guaranteed MBS trading \nvolume. The reason behind this deep liquidity of the TBA market \nis in its homogenous nature driven by standardization of loan \npools and underwriting criteria, market standards and history, \nand the elimination of credit risk via the Government \nguarantee.\n    This deep liquidity not only drives down costs allowing a \ncheaper interest rate to be charged to the consumer, but it \nalso enables the mortgage originator to hedge its risk, which \nin turn can be passed through to the consumer in the form of a \nrate lock to give them certainty of interest rate. Any reform \nprocess needs to be considerate of the credit risk to the \nhomogeneity of the TBA market. For this reason, we suggest that \nthere are three sequential stages that any reform effort should \nfollow in order to preserve the TBA market.\n    First, the conversion into a common TBA should be adopted, \nmaking Freddie and Fannie MBS fungible and, therefore, \ndeliverable into a single TBA market.\n    Second, any legislation should provide for the creation of \na single agency security. This would facilitate the conversion \nand continued liquidity of legacy securities and promote a deep \nand liquid new-issue MBS market.\n    And then, third, a common securitization platform should be \nestablished to oversee and maintain the standardization of the \nmarket for Government-guaranteed MBS.\n    SFIG believes that retaining a Government guarantee against \ncatastrophic loss for MBS is crucial to preserving the health \nof the TBA market.\n    Historically, rates investors have been attracted to the \nGovernment-guaranteed MBS in which the Government bears the \nbulk of the credit risk, and they have contributed trillions of \ndollars to the agency market because of those guarantees. \nLimiting the Government's involvement in the market by changing \nor ending the current infrastructure must account for the \ncrucial contribution that rates investors make to the agency \nmarket and their historical aversion to credit risk.\n    We also believe that private investors have a role to play \nin ensuring against the credit risks posed by residential \nmortgages. To that end, SFIG generally supports having private \ncapital take on credit risk in the first loss position with the \nexplicit Government guarantee covering catastrophic risk.\n    SFIG continues to analyze the amount of risk that a private \ninvestor should assume, and we will provide the Committee with \nour ideas at a later date. However, whatever the final private \nenhancement is, it should be based on underwriting-related \nfactors such as historical loss data, the likely loan times, \nand general housing and economic indicators.\n    Turning next to the mechanics of transitioning to a new \nstructure, this process must be transparent, appropriate to \nmarket conditions, and handled with great care to minimize the \ndisruptions to the flow of credit to consumers and, in \nparticular, to ensure the continued health of the TBA market.\n    We believe steps must be taken to preserve the market for \nlegacy securities while allowing sufficient time for eligible \nloans under the reformed system to be generated and take hold \nin the TBA market. SFIG believes that the best way to \nfacilitate this transition is to create a single agency \nsecurity to which the legacy securities would be converted. We \nalso believe that the current and new infrastructure should \noperate in tandem for some period of time until the new \nframework has demonstrated that it will facilitate the \ncontinued functioning of the TBA market.\n    Finally, there are a number of initiatives underway around \nthe country in which governments plan to exercise their eminent \ndomain power to seize underperforming mortgage loans. Such use \nof eminent domain will undermine congressional efforts to \nencourage private capital in the market, and we encourage the \nCommittee to include a provision limiting it in any reform \nlegislation.\n    In conclusion, while we recognize the need to correct the \nerrors of the past, we urge the Committee not to lose sight of \nthe ways in which the agency market, and particularly the TBA \nmarket, has and continues to work well, enabling many Americans \nto enjoy the benefits of home ownership. We look forward to \nworking with the Committee as it considers these vitally \nimportant issues. Thank you again for the opportunity to share \nSFIG's views.\n    Chairman Johnson. Thank you.\n    Dr. Zandi, you may proceed."

break,break,break,break
"","","tester","Senator Tester","    Mr. Zandi. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Vice Chairman, and \nthe rest of the Committee, for the opportunity to be here \ntoday.\n    For the purposes of the meeting, the Committee hearing, you \nshould know that I am on the board of MGIC. That is the largest \nmortgage insurer in the country. That is important for you to \nknow. I am also on the board of the Reinvestment Fund. That is \none of the Nation's largest CDFIs. And I am also, obviously, an \nemployee of the Moody's Corporation. So those are very \nimportant things. These are my opinions, not those of Moody's \nor anyone else.\n    There are many essential elements to a good, well-\nfunctioning housing finance system. I go through many of them \nin my written testimony. I want to focus in my current remarks \non one essential element, and that is the capital requirements \nof the new system. So I am going to talk a little bit about the \namount of capital that is appropriate, the sources of that \ncapital, and the cost of that capital.\n    I should say up front that I am taking as given that we are \nin a world of a hybrid system; that is, private first loss \ncapital with a catastrophic Government guarantee. So in almost \nall circumstances, private investors will shoulder the burden \nof the losses. In very rare circumstances, catastrophes, the \nGovernment would step in and backstop the system. The guarantee \nwould be explicit. It would be paid for by lenders and \nborrowers and not taxpayers. And the hybrid system is in the \nspirit of Corker-Warner. It is also what the President has \nrecently come out in support of.\n    In terms of the amount of capital, in my view the \nappropriate amount of capital--a good benchmark for the \nappropriate amount of capital is the Great Recession. In the \nrecession, Fannie, Freddie, the private MIs lost or will lose \nultimately about 4 percent. That is the loss rate, all in. To \nbe conservative, I think it would be appropriate to capitalize \nthe system at 5 percent. I think that would cover all \nsignificant circumstances.\n    That would be particularly conservative in the sense that \nthe mortgages that get the Government guarantee in the future \nsystem under all proposals would be QM and, therefore, the \nloans that got Fannie and Freddie into real trouble, the Alt-A \nloans, would not be guaranteed in the future system. So I think \n5 percent would be appropriate.\n    In terms of the sources of capital, they should be varied. \nWe need capital--we need lots of capital. This is going to take \na lot of capital, and it should come from everywhere. So we \nneed capital coming from mortgage bond guarantors, MI \ncompanies, and the capital markets. Very important. When you \nhave varied sources of capital, that creates stability in the \nsystem. That would be particularly, I think, the key feature of \ncapital coming from mortgage bond guarantors. And it will be \ncheaper if you have it from varied sources of capital, and the \ncapital markets are very, very important to that. And I think \nin the Corker-Warner legislation, one of the key features of \nthat legislation that I find attractive is that it promotes \nvaried sources of capital. We need that. It is very important \nto the future of the housing finance system.\n    In terms of the cost of the capital, you know, it is not \nfree. If we are going to have a higher capitalization rate, \nmortgage rates are going to be higher. The question is how much \nhigher. Well, it depends on lots of moving parts, and it may \nhave to make a lot of assumptions. But my sense is under \nreasons assumptions that to go from the current system to a \nsystem that is capitalized at 5 percent probably would add \nanother 40 basis points to mortgage rates, roughly speaking--\nexcuse me, 40 basis points in G-fees, and that would be passed \nthrough largely in higher mortgage rates.\n    Just for context, every 10 basis points is about $15 on a \nmonthly mortgage payment, so you do the arithmetic, going to \nthe new system under my assumptions would add about $60 to the \naverage monthly mortgage payment.\n    One other thing to note is that the cost will vary \nconsiderably depending on how the system is designed, and it \nwill vary depending on the credit risk of the borrower, and it \nwill vary according to where you are in the business cycle. The \nnumbers I just articulated are for the typical borrower through \nthe business cycle.\n    Let me end by saying--this is very important--the current \nsystem is dysfunctional. We have to change it. It is not good \nfor taxpayers. It is not good for home buyers. I think it is \nlaudable that you are taking this up in a very serious way.\n    Thank you.\n    Chairman Johnson. Thank you very much for your testimony.\n    As we begin questions, I will ask the clerk to put 5 \nminutes on the clock for each Member.\n    Ms. Gordon, I am very concerned about the mortgage access \nin rural areas. What is needed in a new system to ensure that \nborrowers with similar qualifications have equal access to \nmortgages no matter where they live? How would you design \nrequirements to ensure that borrowers and lenders in States \nlike mine are not left out?\n    Ms. Gordon. Thank you for that question. It is a very \nimportant question, both for rural borrowers in States like \nyours and for any borrower who lives in either a rural area or \nwho may be in an urban area or some area that is not as well \nand easily served by primary lenders.\n    So what is important to remember is that while the \ninterface for most borrowers with the system is through their \nprimary lender, lenders will make those loans that the \nsecondary market encourages them to make through policies. And \nwe have had--in the system that, you know, we are hoping to \nreform, there have been mechanisms through Fannie and Freddie \nthat do require lenders to be mindful that they are equally \nserving all creditworthy borrowers, you know, regardless of \nwhere they live or whether, you know, their file is a little \nbit harder to go through all the papers for than somebody \nelse's.\n    And we are very concerned that if we do not build in \nmechanisms to address that, lenders will be able to, you know, \nwhat you might think of as cream the market, just basically do \nthe low-hanging fruit, do the easy mortgages, do the mortgages \nwith higher balances within whatever the loan limits are of the \nsystem, and that people will be disadvantaged, particularly in \nStates like yours.\n    And so we think it is critical to establish in this bill \nsome kind of responsibility for the secondary market to oversee \nmaking sure that all of these parts of the market are being \nadequately served, which means, you know, doing some kind of \nexamination of the market, some kind of examination of where \nthe demand and need is, and then looking at whatever entities \nultimately are accessing the Government guarantee and providing \nthe wrap, making sure that they are covering all of these \ndifferent populations equally.\n    Chairman Johnson. Mr. Lienhard, will qualified borrowers \nand lenders of all sizes have fair access to the secondary \nmarket if private capital is require to play a larger role in \nfront of a Government guarantee? Will this work with the TBA \nmarket? And how does the TBA market impact borrowers and \nlenders?\n    Mr. Lienhard. Thank you for the question, Senator. I think \nthat the beauty of the TBA market or actually the beauty of the \nconstruct that we have now and what I think needs to be \npreserved, as I mentioned in my testimony, is this separation \nof credit risk from interest rate risk. And so presumably the \ninterest rate risk investors do not differentiate between the \ncreditworthiness of the borrower. That is disintermediated \nahead of the TBA market by the credit guarantee function. So as \nI understand your question--and I would be happy to have you \nhelp make me more clear in that understanding--I think the \nanswer to your question is properly structured, yes. But I \nthink that the critical nature of that structure does not \nnecessarily reside in the TBA market but, rather, in the \nguarantee aspect of whatever reform we do. I do not know if \nthat is a comprehensive answer.\n    Chairman Johnson. Mr. Johns, do you believe private \ninvestors are willing to stand in the first loss position \nbefore our Government guarantee both in good times and bad? \nWhat will investors need to accept credit risk of a first loss \nposition? And does that work with the TBA market?\n    Mr. Johns. I think the short answer is that investors are \nprepared to step into that role, as we have seen on the Freddie \ntransaction. There was a sizable demand for the credit-linked \nnote product, and I think there were 50 investors or over 50 \ninvestors, and the investors were scaled back fairly \nsignificantly, and I think all reads from the market are that \nthere will be support for, you know, being able to facilitate \nthose transactions again.\n    In addition, obviously, you have to look at the sort of \nbroad swath of options out there such as the mortgage insurers \nand the bond insurers, you know, together with the capital \nmarkets, looking for the way to raise the private capital.\n    Chairman Johnson. Senator Crapo."
"crapo","Senator Crapo","tester","Senator Tester","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    I hope this question I want to get into here will evoke \nresponses from all of you on the panel. I am going to start out \nwith Dr. Zandi and Mr. Johns and then move to Mr. Lienhard and \nMs. Gordon.\n    The issue is the forms and sources of private capital that \nwe need to bring into the market. I think there is pretty \nclearly an emerging consensus that whatever the shape of the \nfuture housing finance system we create is, it must be designed \nto attract more private capital and decrease the Government \nrole from what we currently have.\n    That being said, I think that I see in the testimony of the \nwitnesses a little variation in terms of how we should approach \nthat. Mr. Johns and Dr. Zandi, in your testimonies you both \nhave advocated for the allowance of various forms of private \ncapital to come into the system to meet market needs. So to \nstart with you, what are the benefits that you see to sourcing \nprivate capital from many sources? And maybe you could also \nkind of define what you see those sources being broadly?\n    Mr. Zandi. Well, there are two broad sources. The first is \nwhat I would call an insurance source--bond guarantors, private \nmortgage insurers, insurance entities. And the second I would \nlabel as capital market sources. Both are critical to a well-\nfunctioning system.\n    The insurance capital is more stable through thick and thin \nbecause of the way it is structured and set up, and one of the \ngoals of any future housing finance system is that it obviously \nhas to be stable. We need the flow of mortgage credit through \ngood times and bad times.\n    The strength of the capital markets source of capital is \nthat it can bring down the costs, and most of you get price \ndiscovery. You get a clearer sense of what the cost of risk is, \nbecause capital markets are pretty good at doing that. And so \nby bringing in capital market sources, you will lower the cost \nto mortgage borrowers through lower mortgage rates. So both are \nvery important.\n    Now, how you structure that and how you align those two \nsources of capital up is a very difficult but critical \nquestion, and that is very, very important, but both sources \nare needed."
"crapo","Senator Crapo","crapo","Senator Crapo","    Well, thank you, and we probably need to get \ninto that in some depth, but I do need to move along. So, Mr. \nJohns, do you want to add anything to that perspective?\n    Mr. Johns. I think that I would go along with what Dr. \nZandi said, that we would support their--I think, you know, \nmaybe a couple of points. It is all--well, it is not all \nabout--a lot of our focus needs to be on making sure that the \nTBA market continues to function when you look at the private \ncapital alternatives. And, you know, insurance is not something \nthat necessarily can directly impact the pool of loans within \nthe MBS, and, therefore, I think that is something that has \nsome potential.\n    The credit-linked note structure that Freddie did was a \nsynthetic transaction, and, therefore, the actual loans that it \nreferenced, you know, were not specifically sort of cash-flow \nimpacted in the structure of the transaction, leaving the TBA \nmarket largely unaffected as a consequence.\n    There are other structures, senior subordination, you know, \nstructures where you might say--you know, have a sort of deep \nsubordination piece of the transaction and then have a AAA or a \nsenior rated piece that is delivered into the TBA market. That \nis a different structure that we would have to look at and \nevaluate exactly how we would get that to work with the TBA \nmarket that is currently based on a pass-through mechanism."
"crapo","Senator Crapo","crapo","Senator Crapo","    All right. Thank you.\n    And, Mr. Lienhard, I may have to get to you next time, the \nnext round, because I am running out of time and I wanted to \nget to Ms. Gordon, because if I understand it correctly, you \nbelieve we should rely solely on bond guarantors. Is that \ncorrect?\n    Ms. Gordon. That is what I believe, and it is really for \ntwo reasons. One is, as everybody has been discussing, the \nimportance of the TBA market and the belief that even--you \nknow, we have already heard that a senior substructure would \npose some problems for TBA. But even if you have some other \nkind of reference pool type structure, the fact is that these \nsort of one-off deals do not lend themselves as well to the \nkind of homogeneity that you need for an effective TBA market. \nThey do not do as good a job at allocating risks across years, \nregions, lenders, and the like, but especially across years \nthat you have an insurance format.\n    And also, just to Dr. Zandi's point regarding price \ndiscovery, we do have to--the private capital market's track \nrecord on pricing mortgage risk is checkered, as is \neverybody's, and so that is an area where you do introduce some \nuncertainty. And, again, even if in any individual structured \ntransaction that actual transaction is funded, if you do not \nknow how the investor institutions are carrying that on their \nbooks and evaluating it, you do not know if you are just \nexporting risk out of that particular mortgage-backed security \ninto the larger financial system."
"crapo","Senator Crapo","crapo","Senator Crapo","    Well, thank you. My time has run out, but we \nwill get back to this.\n    Chairman Johnson. Senator Reed.\n    Senator Reed. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I \nwant to commend Senator Corker and Senator Warner for moving so \nthoughtfully on this issue. I think, again, I thank the \nwitnesses, but also the Chairman and the Ranking Member \nbecause, as we move here, I think we appreciate with each step \nhow complex, interrelated, and how thoughtful we have to be \nabout these judgments. We are transforming a huge, huge part of \nour economy, and I am glad we started, and I think Senator \nCorker and Senator Warner deserve a great deal of credit. Thank \nyou, gentlemen, very much, and I thank the Chairman and the \nRanking Member.\n    Mr. Zandi, just this very simple-minded question in a very \ncomplex field, but you talk about capital, but one of the--sort \nof looking back, there was a lot of mysterious capital in the \nbanking field several years ago, i.e., people created entities, \nborrowed, leveraged themselves up to their--you know, wherever \nthey could, and then it used that capital to go in and to \ninvest in different products.\n    I know there is an ongoing FHFA pilot program, $30 billion \nin credit risk, et cetera. In general, and in terms of the \npilot, is that an issue we have to deal with? And how might we \ndeal with it in terms of avoiding being overleveraged?\n    Mr. Zandi. Well, that is a good question. One of the \nconcerns about capital markets as a source of capital is, in \nfact, leverage in the entire system. This is what Ms. Gordon \nwas referring to. And it needs to be considered in the context \nof the broader financial system and any future housing finance \nsystem that we establish. So that is a potential risk created \nby drawing capital from the capital markets.\n    I do not think we are anywhere close to that yet. We are in \nearly stages here, and what Freddie and Fannie are doing is \nquite small in the context of all the things that are going on, \nand quite appropriate, in my view, because we need to \nexperiment. We need to see what works, what does not work, what \nthe risks really are, and how to manage those risks.\n    So what they are doing is entirely appropriate, but you are \nright when we are thinking about the future of the housing \nfinance system and the capital structure and where the capital \nis coming from, this is one of the risks that we need to really \nthink about because there is a potential systemic problem.\n    Senator Reed. And that just touches on what I think \neveryone has reflected, that there has to be a regulatory \nauthority here that is looking at where the capital is coming \nfrom, that is looking at: Are these products accessible, \navailable to everyone? Do they include multi-family housing as \nwell as single-family housing? And that is something I think we \nwould all recognize.\n    Mr. Zandi. Yes, I think I am taking as given that we are \ngoing to have a catastrophic Government guarantee. I cannot see \nany system that does not work without that, and that requires \nregulation.\n    Senator Reed. And that guarantor would be effectively a \nregulator as well as a guarantor.\n    Mr. Zandi. Exactly, yes.\n    Senator Reed. Mr. Johns, you talked about the TBA market is \nvery critical, and there are multiple proposals, but one \nproposal seems to separate it into sort of two categories: \nfirst, a guaranteed piece up front, and then an unguaranteed \npiece, which would be sort of--or senior/junior, however you \nwant to describe it. The issue might be, How do you price the \nsecond piece? It is pretty easy with a guaranteed--or easier to \nprice a guaranteed issuance. I think that is a fair assumption. \nIs that a problem with this, having this set of bifurcated \napproach to TBA markets?\n    Mr. Johns. I do not know whether it is a problem \nnecessarily. It is certainly something I am happy to take away \nto our members and talk about.\n    What I might highlight there is that with that proposal you \nare creating a bifurcation of the old market versus the new \nmarket, and consequently, you will have a very shallow new \nmarket when you move forward with that structure, which creates \nits own liquidity issues in and of itself.\n    Senator Reed. So the question then--one of the first \nquestions not only in terms of pricing is liquidity. Would \nactually anyone come into that market given the narrow--the \nability--the lack of liquidity. Is that a fair----\n    Mr. Johns. I think so. I mean, look at liquidity as almost \nsynonymous with cost. If you have shallow liquidity, the cost \ngoes up. If you have deep liquidity, the cost goes down.\n    Senator Reed. Again, I think this is extremely helpful, and \nas we go forward, I think we will learn more and I think very \nproductively raise more questions than initially we will have \nanswers, and that will allow us to come to a better answer at \nthe end of the day. But thank you all for your excellent \ntestimony.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Chairman Johnson. Senator Corker."
"corker","Senator Corker","crapo","Senator Crapo","    Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, thanks for \nhaving the hearing, and I do think we are at a point in time, \nafter really 5 years--I remember how controversial the whole \nFreddie/Fannie issue was during the time we tried to do \nfinancial regulation. I think we are at a point where we are \nready to take that on, and I thank you for having these \noutstanding witnesses.\n    To the witnesses, you know, 10 Members of this Committee, 5 \non each side, have gotten behind the bill called S. 1217, and \nnumbers of other folks on the Committee I know are working on \nthis issue and have really spent a lot of time on it. And I \ncommend everybody for the time they spent on this issue.\n    But starting with you, Dr. Zandi, is Senate bill 1217, with \n10 Members of this Committee on it and probably others being \nadded, a good starting point?\n    Mr. Zandi. Absolutely. I think it is an excellent starting \npoint. I think it shows a lot of hard work and a lot of good \nideas and thoughts. And I do not know why you would want to \nstart from scratch. I would start with that legislation. It is \nan excellent place to get going."
"corker","Senator Corker","corker","Senator Corker","    Mr. Johns?\n    Mr. Johns. I would agree. I think, you know, as I \ntestified, we do believe that there is a phased implementation \nthat we can work with on this, but the framework in and of \nitself and the end game is something that in general the \nindustry is supportive of."
"corker","Senator Corker","corker","Senator Corker","    Mr. Lienhard?\n    Mr. Lienhard. I believe a multi-trillion-dollar industry \nbeing run in conservatorship is long term an untenable \nsituation. I think this bill definitely highlights all of the \nissues in moving forward, so, yes, I think it is a very good \nstart."
"corker","Senator Corker","corker","Senator Corker","    Ms. Gordon?\n    Ms. Gordon. Absolutely I agree. I am just so glad that \nsomeone has started because I agree with Mr. Lienhard that we \ncannot continue in the conservatorship mode.\n    There does remain, as I mentioned, work to be done. I think \nwe have done a lot of work on the sort of asset class side of \nthings. We still need to do a lot of work on the access for \nborrowers side to get the bill to a place where we will, you \nknow, feel like it can pick up and do better than the last \nsystem."
"corker","Senator Corker","corker","Senator Corker","    I appreciate that, and I would hope \neverybody would continue to make what has been worked on for a \nyear even better, and I thank you for that comment.\n    One of the things I think that the 10 Senators who all made \nmajor contributions to this piece of legislation, all of which \nare on this Committee, tried to do was to create something that \nis more dynamic. I think all of us know we have this duopoly \nright now. I know that even though it has some strengths, there \nare a lot of weaknesses in that regard. And just again to go in \nthe same order, have we done something with the construct? \nAgain, we all know that, you know, there are tweaks that people \nwould like to make, but have the 10 Senators on this Committee \nthat have worked on this created something that is more dynamic \nin structure than the system we now have?\n    Mr. Zandi. Yes, and I think that goes to the fact that in \nthe legislation, you worked very hard to promote varied sources \nof capital. It is not just coming from one place. Let a \nthousand flowers bloom. Let us see what works here, what does \nnot work. At some points in time, some sources of capital are \ngoing to work better than other sources of capital. And I think \nthat makes the system dynamic, as you say, certainly more \ninnovative because there is going to be more competition in the \nsystem as a result of that; lower costs because you are going \nto have capital coming in from different places; and, \nultimately more resilient, as well.\n    So, I think that is the strength of the legislation, that \nyou are allowing the system to be, as you call it, more \ndynamic, yes."
"corker","Senator Corker","corker","Senator Corker","    Thank you.\n    Mr. Johns. I would agree again with what Dr. Zandi says. I \nthink as well the developments of a common securitization \nplatform that allows you to have more dynamicism, and the \nvarious forms of capital that could be--you know, private \ncapital that can be considered for the proposed enhancement I \nthink as well leaves you with a dynamic element. Of course, \nthat could, you know, settle hopefully as we feel our way as to \nwhat the most viable structure is."
"corker","Senator Corker","corker","Senator Corker","    OK.\n    Mr. Lienhard. I am assuming we have the same definition of \ndynamic, yes, but one of the things I am concerned about--and \nit is not entirely clear to me that the bill yet addresses \nthis--is the relative potential--the potential to disadvantage \na regional originator versus a national originator, an \nunintended consequence of that simply because of the regional \nconcentration or various exposures that exist in certain \nStates, and so that would be something I would really be \nconcerned about. So dynamic, yes, but I am not sure that is \nclear."
"corker","Senator Corker","corker","Senator Corker","    Well, and I am glad you made that comment. \nYou know, I have spent a lot of time with your CEO and your \nformer CEO, and, you know, regionals are kind of no-man's-land. \nYou know, some people like that, some people do not. I think \nyou all like it. But I do think that we have done a lot here to \nfocus on, you know, where the--making sure the larger \ninstitutions do not have an advantage and making sure that the \nsmaller institutions, as I think the Chairman alluded to when \nhe began, had a lot of access. But I agree that we need to do \nsome work to ensure that the regionals that in some ways are \nno-man's-land end up in a good place, and I appreciate you \nbringing that up. And I am not going to go to you, Ms. Gordon, \nbecause I am--I know I am out of time. I do want to say just if \nI could make one point, thank you, though for being here and \nthanks for your organization's contributions to helping us all \nwith this bill.\n    There has been some discussion about capital and the \nincreased cost--of the 10 percent capital, I might add, Dr. \nZandi. But I am just, of course, getting with you.\n    The fact is, you know, there are numbers of things that \nactually lower the cost, and when you look at the increased \ncompetition, the fact that you have issuers who are going to be \ncompeting with technology, you have got a single security \nplatform instead of a dual platform like we have now, you have \nthe full faith and credit, you have got uniform PSA, you have \ngot a clear definition of reps and warrants, and, candidly, you \nmove beyond the legal limbo that we are in.\n    So I know that there are some costs of capital, but when \nyou create the kind of dynamic and clear clarity that we would \nbe doing with this bill, you also have some things that would \nlower costs. Would that be a fair statement to make?\n    Mr. Zandi. Absolutely. And I did not comment on the 10 \npercent capital. In my view, 5 percent is appropriate. But \ngetting to 10 percent, I think it can be organized in a way \nthat it is not too costly. And you are absolutely right, there \nare things in the legislation--which should be, by the way, in \nevery legislation--that will lower costs relative to where we \nare today, absolutely."
"corker","Senator Corker","corker","Senator Corker","    I thank all of your for your testimony and \nyour contribution and Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member for \nhaving this hearing.\n    Chairman Johnson. Senator Menendez.\n    Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all \nfor your testimony.\n    As the Committee considers its priority for housing finance \nreform, I think there are several objectives, but one that I \nwould like to hear from you on that I think is very important \nand that I consider the bedrock of our current system is the \n30-year, fixed-rate mortgage, which has made home ownership \nmore accessible and affordable for generations of Americans, \nand most assessments of the market have concluded that, without \nsome form of public sector guarantee or backstop, the vast \nmajority of home buyers would lose access to that type of \nproduct.\n    So, number one, for the panel, do you all agree with this \nassessment? And, second, can you discuss what would be the \nimpact to home buyers and even homeowners who, as they try to \nsell, would find themselves with a marketplace quite different \nin terms of who the buyer would be of losing a 30-year, fixed-\nrate mortgage?\n    Ms. Gordon. I am happy to take a start. Yes, we absolutely \nagree with you that the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage has been a \ntremendous product for families. It is sustainable. It helps \nmake home ownership affordable. And we think protecting it \nshould be one of the key goals of the work we are doing here \nnow.\n    We believe you really need two things to protect that \nproduct: one is the Government backstop guarantee, and the \nother is the TBA market, which needs to be sufficiently liquid \nthat institutional investors can move in and out as they are \nrequired to do so that they continue to have interest in \nparticipating in this system. And so that is--you know, as we \ngo forward--assuming that we have now somewhat crossed the \nRubicon of having the guarantee and these discussions, really \ndigging down and making sure that we are really protecting that \nTBA market and that we fully understand the impact of these \ndifferent structures on that is really important. You know, as \nMr. Johns said, if we start to fragment that or make TBA \nshallower, it will not work as well.\n    Mr. Johns. I would just follow on from Ms. Gordon there. I \nthink Ms. Gordon highlighted the need for the TBA and the \nGovernment guarantee. I think the two are effectively the same. \nIf you are going to have the TBA remain liquid, you know, then \nthe guarantee is required. And if the guarantee is there, the \nTBA market should be there providing we are cautious not to \nfragment that market, which will enable the maintaining of the \n30-year fixed.\n    Senator Menendez. Well, I hope we have crossed the Rubicon. \nI am never sure we have crossed the Rubicon until we cross it. \nBut I hope that that is there. I think this is one of the \nessential elements, and I think those who have been working on \nthis issue--I have shared my thoughts on it--I think they \nbelieve so, too.\n    Another thing that I am concerned about is a multitude of \nhousing finance reform plans that many of you have either \nauthored and/or helped contribute to. I think most of those \nplans acknowledge the need to keep in place some form of that \nGovernment guarantee or backstop, and in doing so, the \nattention naturally turns to policies as it relates to \nprotecting taxpayers from losses, which is an important \ninterest.\n    One example that is given in that regard is setting minimum \nunderwriting standards for a mortgage to qualify for a \nguarantee. And as part of those standards, some proposals have \nsuggested requiring a high minimum downpayment for a borrower \nto qualify.\n    Now, certainly no- and low-downpayment mortgages were a \nmajor problem during the financial crisis, and a downpayment \ncertainly can affect the size of the riskiness of a loan. But \nmy concern is that if we go too far in the other direction and \nset the bar too high, we will end up shutting out the market of \ncreditworthy individuals and families who will have other \ncompensating factors and are in a high-risk default at all. I \nknow that in my own case, the first home that I bought, if some \nof the standards that are being suggested were the case, I \nwould never have achieved that. And I was a responsible \nborrower and have been a responsible borrower ever since.\n    So my concern is a requirement that is too high can \nseriously undermine the goal of helping Americans afford home \nownership. There is one prominent analysis that estimates that \nit would take an average family 14 years to save for a 5-\npercent downpayment and 22 years to save for a 10-percent \ndownpayment.\n    So my question--maybe, Ms. Gordon, I think you have done a \nlot of work in this regard, but I am happy to hear from \nothers--can you elaborate on the importance of getting the \ncalibration right on the policies like downpayment requirements \nin order to properly balance the goals of protecting taxpayers \nbut also meeting the goals that we have of making sure that we \ncan give responsible borrowers the opportunity to have the \nability to own their home?\n    Ms. Gordon. Thank you so much for asking that question. \nThis is a matter of utmost concern to us when we think about \naccessibility of the system to the average homeowner.\n    First, let me just say that while we saw a problem during \nthe crisis with loans that had low downpayments, it was not the \nlow downpayment characteristic that caused these loans to be \nrisky. These loans tended to be heavily risk layered; you know, \nmaybe it was a negative amortization loan that had a low \ndownpayment and had little or no underwriting that was taking \nplace. And that caused loans that were low downpayment to be \nrisky or to fail. There is quite a great deal of evidence that \nwell-underwritten and safe fixed-rate mortgages that were made \nwith low downpayments performed quite well throughout the \ncrisis. And so, you know, I think we cannot just isolate that \none factor and say this factor in and of itself is a big \nproblem.\n    That said, you know, different lenders will have different \nviews as to downpayment, which I think is appropriate. What I \ndo not think we should do is enshrine a particular number in \nlegislation. I think that would be a mistake regardless of \nwhich number we pick.\n    Senator Menendez. Thank you.\n    Chairman Johnson. Senator Johanns.\n    Senator Johanns. Let me also add my voice to those who are \nsaying thanks to Senator Warner and Senator Corker. And to the \nRanking Member and to the Chair, thank you so much for taking \nthis issue on.\n    Ms. Gordon, I could not agree with you more. Thank goodness \nsomebody after 5 years has grabbed hold of this, because the \none thing that seems clear from everybody's testimony is the \ncurrent system is not where we want to be. We need to head in a \ndifferent direction.\n    Dr. Zandi, you are probably feeling picked on because I am \ngoing to start with you also at the start here.\n    Mr. Zandi. Well, you know, all my life I have been at the \nend of the list."
break,break,break,break
"","","","","    [Laughter.]\n    Senator Johanns. That is right.\n    Mr. Zandi. Bring it on. It feels good.\n    Senator Johanns. It feels good to be in the A category, I \nguess.\n    Mr. Zandi. In the A category, yes.\n    Senator Johanns. I was following your testimony about \ncapitalization, and I think there are a lot of central pieces \nto this legislation, S. 1217, but I think that has got--we have \ngot to get that right, or this thing just does not work.\n    You expressed an opinion that 5 percent is a good \nbenchmark. I do not disagree with that. I think there is some \nsafety built into that. You talked about varied sources of \ncapital, and you have expanded on that.\n    You then talked about G-fees and the impact on the monthly \npayment. I want you for the record, just so we are clear on \nthis, to please explain how G-fees and other sources of capital \nare going to get us to this varied capital system, if you will. \nDo you follow my question?\n    Mr. Zandi. I am not sure I do.\n    Senator Johanns. Yes. What I am trying to figure out is: \nHow would you describe G-fees relating to what we are trying to \naccomplish here? That is really what I am getting to.\n    Mr. Zandi. G-fee is a guarantee fee. It is the cost to \nmortgage borrowers through the mortgage interest rate for \npaying for the potential losses that will occur from the \nlending. So, you know, you make loans. Some loans are going to \ngo bad. That is going to create losses. And you need to charge \na fee to compensate for those losses, and that is what the \nguarantee fee is.\n    Now, if you want to be prepared for a little bit of loss, \nthen you would only need a lower G-fee. If you want to be \nprepared for bigger losses, which I think we are talking about \nhere--and we need to be prepared for bigger losses given what \nwe went through--it is going to result in a higher G-fee or a \nhigher mortgage rate.\n    Senator Johanns. And to get to----\n    Mr. Zandi. Does that make sense?\n    Senator Johanns. It does.\n    Mr. Zandi. OK.\n    Senator Johanns. To get to the 5 percent that you think we \nshould be focused on, you are saying that the net effect of \nthis to the borrower is going to be roughly $60 a month.\n    Mr. Zandi. Yes. That is obviously a lot of moving parts, a \nlot of assumptions. I am making assumptions about the future \nfinance system, how we are going to organize ourselves. But my \nsense of it is that is a good ballpark figure. To get from \nwhere we are today, literally today, to that 5 percent world \nthat we all feel really comfortable about and everything looks \nproper, I think it is going to be $60 a month, roughly.\n    Senator Johanns. OK. Now let me shift focus a little, and \nothers can jump into this. In my State, like so many other \nStates, I am worried about the small lender, the community bank \nout there that is not looking to be regional, but they want to \nserve their clientele. They want to create a relationship and \ncontinue that relationship.\n    We have tried with S. 1217 to make sure that their \ninterests are protected. I would like your opinion as to \nwhether you think S. 1217 gets us there.\n    Mr. Zandi. Would you like my opinion?\n    Senator Johanns. Yes. Start, and we can go right on down.\n    Mr. Zandi. I do. I think it is clear that the legislation \nis very sensitive to this issue. There are two key elements of \nthe legislation that address this. One is in the common \nsecuritization platform there will be multi-lender securities. \nSo what that means is that small lenders--community banks--can \nsell into a security, and that security will get the Government \nguarantee. So they have access to the Government guarantee. So \nthat is very important and I think critical to any system, \nbecause that is important for rural areas and more niche \nmarkets.\n    The second aspect of this is in the legislation itself \nthere is a carveout for a bond guarantor that would service, \nexplicitly service small lenders. So it is in the legislation. \nIt is there to help protect against some of the concerns that \nyou might have.\n    So I think there are things we can think about and we can \ntweak this and make this probably work a little bit better. But \nI think those two things go a long way to addressing that \nconcern.\n    Senator Johanns. I am just going to have to ask the rest of \nthe panel if they see something different, because I am out of \ntime. Mr. Johns?\n    Mr. Johns. I would not say I see anything different. I \nwould maybe sort of add to that that when you are looking at \nsome of the constructs of, for instance, the credit-linked note \nproduct, you also want to be amenable--or we should as an \nindustry be looking at potential structures that allow multi-\nissuers to that extent, which also, I think, ties in with one \nof the points that Mr. Lienhard made earlier.\n    Senator Johanns. Go ahead.\n    Mr. Lienhard. As I look at the legislation, I do think that \nit has addressed the needs of small lenders well, and I think \nabout the regionals as being the ones sort of disadvantaged.\n    Senator Johanns. OK.\n    Mr. Lienhard. I will answer in the negative.\n    Senator Johanns. Ms. Gordon, any thoughts on that?\n    Ms. Gordon. I am glad the legislation does have some \nspecific structures that will help in this regard. You know, I \nthink some other things that--there are some ways to prevent \nmarket concentration that are not in here, such as preventing \nan originator from also being a bond guarantor, that I think we \nshould think about for this legislation.\n    Senator Johanns. OK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Chairman Johnson. Senator Warner.\n    Senator Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    I want to again actually start with Mr. Zandi. I think you \nappropriately pointed out that any reform may add some costs. \nBut wouldn't you agree that at this point in conservatorship \nthat we have an artificially low, nonsustainable pricing system \nin that we have no private capital, we have a direct Government \nguarantee, Fannie and Freddie have--so that regardless of what \nreform would look like, there is going to be some bump-up in \nmortgage rates just because the system now has, in effect, no \ncapital at risk?\n    Mr. Zandi. Yes, I think that is clear. I mean, I think the \nquestion is ultimately who pays. Is it the taxpayer who is \ngoing to pay for the mortgage, or is it going to be the lender \nand the borrower who pays for the mortgage, the full, all-in \ncost going through thick and thin economies? And right now it \nis on the taxpayer.\n    Senator Warner. Right now it is 100 percent on the \ntaxpayers, no private capital at risk.\n    Mr. Zandi. And I think that is not appropriate.\n    Senator Warner. We, in effect, have while potentially \nartificially low mortgage rates at this point, we clearly have \nall taxpayer exposure.\n    Mr. Zandi. It is all taxpayer exposure, and it is \ninappropriate. And, actually, given the rise in G-fees since \nthe GSEs have been in conservatorship, this has become less of \nan issue, but it is certainly still an issue.\n    Senator Warner. And would there be any disagreement on the \npanel in terms of the current status?\n    Mr. Lienhard, let me acknowledge--one, thank you for coming \nup from Richmond. And, two, I agree with some of my colleagues \nthat while we have, I believe, tried to make a very good-faith \neffort to make sure that the community-based banks, the credit \nunions and others, get access through a mutual or other entity \nso that they get that kind of fair pricing and nondisadvantage, \nthat the regionals are kind of in between here. How will we get \nyou into a market where there is--you get the same kind of \npricing protection, but you get the kind of geographic \ndiversity and others that you need? You know, at least as one \nof the group of 10 who have been involved in this, I am open \nfor business on how we sort that through in a better way. I am \nnot sure if you want to make any direct comment right now, but \nI look forward to----\n    Mr. Lienhard. I mean, the only comment I would make is \nthank you for acknowledging that, Senator, and I think it is \nimportant to point out the fact that I believe our customers or \nour clients are advantaged by our ability to compete not only \nwith small lenders but also the large lenders. And to the \nextent that the regionals are just by construct disadvantaged, \nthat reduces the competition. So I appreciate both your and \nSenator Corker's acknowledgment of this and would really look \nforward to working with your staff on ways to resolve----\n    Senator Warner. And let me also acknowledge, I think \nservicing improvements need to be made and there are multi-\nfamily improvements.\n    Ms. Gordon, I want to thank you again publicly for all the \nideas and input you have had. I also want to make a bit of an \neditorial comment here in that, you know, kind of looking back \nat the old system, where we had a profit--you know, this \nprofit-making enterprise that, as times were good, would make \nprofits but when times were bad, the public bore the risk. It \nseemed like we had almost too many functions in Fannie and \nFreddie. We had a profit-making venture. We had this Government \nbackstop entity. And we also had, you know, very important, \nagain, goals that you have articulated quite well, you know, \nmarket access goals.\n    I would argue that the way S. 1217 has tried to separate \nout those goals--and I know you have got ideas on tweaks, but \nactually make sense. And would you acknowledge at least--as a \nmatter of fact, in the old system, unfortunately, these \nentities got criticism from both ends of the political \nspectrum. They got from those who were perhaps on the \nprogressive end saying you are not doing enough, and you got \ninterests from more the market-based section saying you are \ndisrupting your market function by doing too much.\n    Would you acknowledge that many of the very appropriate \npublic housing goals that we would sometimes legislate with \nhousing trust funds and others, worthy goals, but were \noftentimes never funded?\n    Ms. Gordon. Well, we have certainly had a problem in the \npast with not achieving, you know, exactly what we wanted to \nachieve. The National Housing Trust Fund and the Capital Magnet \nFund are not being funded now even though the enterprises are \nawash in proceeds. And so I am not even sure why they are not \nbeing funded at this point.\n    I think that in looking at the bill, which, you know, we \nare very glad to see, though we do, of course, want some \ntweaks, that there is the provision to collect a fund that will \nbe used to support those borrowers or communities that need \nsomething of a leg up to participate in the conventional \nmarket.\n    I do think, just to refer back to my answer to Chairman \nJohnson earlier, that the bill probably needs to do more to \nensure that existing creditworthy borrowers are served, \nregardless of where they are or whether they are self-employed \nor whether they live in a rural area. I think we need to \nadvance more on that.\n    But I think we should be aware, you know, in a policy sense \nthat Fannie and Freddie did have a very clear public purpose. \nIt did have affordable housing goals. And while there are those \nwho think, I think incorrectly, that the goals caused the \ncrisis, whereas there are others, as you noted, on the \nprogressive side who feel like the goals never did enough, the \nfact is if we are dismantling that system, it is absolutely \ncritical to have a strong sense of public purpose at the center \nof this new system in a way that is sustainable and \nappropriate.\n    Senator Warner. And my time is up. I would simply say--and \nI know there are others who disagree with part of this, but at \nleast if we are going to have these goals and part of the \nnontax pricing function of this Government backstop would give \nthis auditable, identifiable funding entity that you could--we \ncould measure in a way that we were never able to measure when \nit was commingled in the old system. And, again, we may agree \nwhether this is appropriate or not, but I actually think there \nis a lot more transparency and a lot better ability to audit \nthan we had in the past. And I thank again the Chair and the \nRanking Member for the hearing and their willingness to work on \nthis.\n    Chairman Johnson. Senator Toomey."
"toomey","Senator Toomey","corker","Senator Corker","    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want \nto follow up in the direction that Senator Warner was going. \nBut first a quick question. I hope there is unanimity about \nthis. That is, with respect to this idea that some \nmunicipalities have floated that they will, under the \njustification that they give citing eminent domain, they are \nthreatening to confiscate certain private-label mortgages from \ninvestors.\n    So putting aside what strikes me as an egregious affront to \nthe Constitution, the rule of law, and private contracts, does \neverybody agree that, to the extent that this were actually to \ntake place, it would certainly discourage private capital from \ngoing into the residential mortgage market? Does everybody \nagree with that? And that that has, of course, the consequence \nof making mortgages either less available or more expensive or \nboth?\n    Mr. Johns. I would actually go a little further and say not \njust it will discourage, it is discouraging, the mere threat--\n--"
"toomey","Senator Toomey","toomey","Senator Toomey","    The mere threat is already having that \neffect.\n    Mr. Johns. Absolutely."
"toomey","Senator Toomey","toomey","Senator Toomey","    Does anybody dissent from that?\n    Ms. Gordon. I mean, I am not sure I will dissent that the \nthreat is having an effect, but I will say that, first of all, \nI think this is a local matter; and, second, there have been \nnumerous efforts for municipalities to be able to address the \nproblem that they face. And until they have a way to address \nthat problem, it is not surprising that a number of different \navenues are being pursued."
"toomey","Senator Toomey","toomey","Senator Toomey","    OK. Thanks.\n    Let me go on to the heart of this, another matter, which is \nI am little concerned that it sounds as though it is almost \ngiven as a certainty that there must be a Government guarantee \nin this market. And I would remind everybody, for what it is \nworth, the House Banking Committee has passed out of Committee \na GSE reform bill that has no Government guarantee. So this is \nnot terribly unusual. I would also point out we have huge \nsegments of our capital markets that have never had a \nGovernment guarantee. Nobody contemplates a Government \nguarantee, I trust, for commercial paper markets and corporate \nbond markets and other sorts of markets where the private \nsector provides massive liquidity on a routine basis.\n    I also want to stress there are very substantial risks, I \nthink, that attend to a Government guarantee. The obvious is it \nputs taxpayers at risk. And I think we should not overlook that \nrisk that taxpayers bear.\n    I think it tends to divert capital that would otherwise go \nto other places, but if the Government is weighing in with a \nguarantee, it creates incentives to send money in certain \nplaces. It probably encourages excessive risk taking.\n    And the last and the biggest risk, I think we have heard \nallusions to it around this table today, which is the \ninevitable politicization of the process. If you have a \nGovernment guarantee, it is necessarily a political process to \ndefine the terms under which one has access to that guarantee. \nAnd in the process of setting those rules, what we hear--and, \nin fact, the Senator from New Jersey brought it up as his very \nnext question--the concern that maybe not enough people will \nhave that access. All the politics always drives toward ever \nexpanding the universe of people who will have access to this, \nand I do believe that this political mandate to expand mortgage \nlending to people, including some who were not able to pay back \nthose mortgages, was absolutely at the heart of the financial \ncrisis that we just went through. And it seems to me \nmaintaining a Government guarantee preserves--continues that \nrisk. And it can be lessened somewhat. I am sure there are ways \nto do that. But I do not see how it ever goes away.\n    Now, it seems to me the arguments I hear and justification \nfor the Government guarantee usually seem to be variations on \nthree arguments: one, we need it to maintain the 30-year, \nfixed-rate mortgage; number two, it helps keep mortgage rates \nlower than they would otherwise be; and, number three, it is \nthe assurance that we will always have a liquid market, even in \nthe worst of circumstances that might otherwise dry up the \nprivate capital.\n    I think we should spend some time really evaluating these \npresumed advantages. I do not think we have challenged them as \nthoroughly as we might.\n    A quick question. Mr. Zandi, I think you were asked the \nquestion in a House hearing, a Banking hearing, I assume, about \nwhether or not you thought there would be a 30-year, fixed-rate \nmortgage product in the absence of a Government guarantee. And \nif my information is correct, the answer was that we probably \nwould have such, and we do, after all, have private-label \nsecurities, including 30-year, fixed-rate private-label \nmortgages that have no Government guarantee. So the product \ndoes exist in the absence of a Government guarantee. Isn't that \ntrue?\n    Mr. Zandi. It does. It would be a marginal product compared \nto where it is today. Europe, the rest of the world, would be a \ngood case study for what the 30-year, fixed-rate would look \nlike without a Government guarantee. And if you look at those \nmarkets, the share of the market that has a 30-year, fixed-\nrate, fully prepayable mortgage is small, 10, 15 percent of the \nmarket."
"toomey","Senator Toomey","toomey","Senator Toomey","    But there could be other differences that \nmight explain part of that as well.\n    Mr. Zandi. Could, yes, absolutely."
"toomey","Senator Toomey","toomey","Senator Toomey","    And so it is not clear that that is the \nwhole thing. And we have had private-label mortgages and jumbo \nmortgages that are 30-year and fixed and they have no \nGovernment guarantee.\n    Mr. Zandi. Yes, but I think it is reasonable--a prudent \nplanner would expect, without any Government guarantee--take \nthe House financial services bill, the PATH bill. If that were \nlaw, taken as is, the share of the mortgage market that would \nbe a 30-year, fixed-rate, fully prepayable mortgage would be \nmuch, much smaller than it is today."
"toomey","Senator Toomey","toomey","Senator Toomey","    Or it might be maintained but at a higher \nrate.\n    Mr. Zandi. Well, it would be at a higher rate, so then it \nwould be unaffordable and therefore the share would be----"
"toomey","Senator Toomey","toomey","Senator Toomey","    Well, it is an open question as to how much \nof the difference in rate gets capitalized in land values and--\n--\n    Mr. Zandi. Absolutely. And, by the way, all your concerns I \nsympathize with. Those are very legitimate concerns and need to \nbe explored. I totally agree with that, that you are absolutely \nright, those are things we need to worry about. That is why a \nhigh rate of capitalization in a hybrid system is critical \nbecause it addresses some of those concerns. It does not \nmitigate them, but it addresses them."
"toomey","Senator Toomey","toomey","Senator Toomey","    I see I have run out of time, but I do hope \nwe will drill down a little bit more on some of these issues. \nAnd, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the indulgence.\n    Chairman Johnson. Senator Warren.\n    Senator Warren. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am very pleased \nthat the Committee is going to focus on housing finance reform \nthis fall. I think it is very important. But as always, the \ndevil is in the details, so I just wanted to ask a couple of \nquestions.\n    I want to go back to the question about underwriting \ncriteria. As you know, there are lots of factors that go into \nthat: income level, total assets, credit history, savings, \noutstanding debt obligations, downpayment amount, just to name \nsome of them. And a borrower can do poorly on some of those but \nstill do well on others and be a good candidate for a mortgage.\n    Community bankers tell me that this very flexible, holistic \napproach is very important to them in placing mortgages and \nmaking their lending decisions based on individual \ncircumstances and market conditions.\n    So I understand why the Government would want to make its \nguarantee--make sure that its guarantee is available for \nmortgages that are likely to be repaid. But the question is how \nto make sure that the Government is insuring decent mortgages. \nSo I want to ask a structural question as we are thinking about \nthis statute.\n    Should the statute set a specific condition that must be \nmet, like a certain downpayment amount or a certain credit \nscore or a certain income level, and then hold hard and fast to \nthat no matter what as a matter of statutory law? Or is it \nbetter to let the mortgage market adapt based on market \nconditions and based on new information about what combination \nof underwriting criteria best predict repayment? Ms. Gordon, \nmaybe I could start with you on that.\n    Ms. Gordon. Sure. Thanks so much for this question, because \nI believe the answer is we absolutely should not set \nunderwriting criteria in legislation in the context of the \nhousing finance system.\n    What we do have now that we did not have before is through \nthe Dodd-Frank Act there are quite specific rules now governing \nthe underwriting of mortgages, and those rules have been the \nsubject of much discussion, much work by the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau, and, you know, quite a lot of interested \nparties have been involved in that process. And while not all \nof us agree with every part of the way the rules came out, \nthose rules are there now, and they are underpinning that \naspect of consumer protection. And so I think it would be \ndifficult if we, as I said, enshrined things in legislation.\n    Senator Warren. OK. And let me just ask that same question \nof Mr. Lienhard. You do this for a living.\n    Mr. Lienhard. Yes, I think that one of the pitfalls I see \nwith hard-coding underwriting standards into legislation is \nthat underwriting expertise and criteria can change over time, \nand so presumably we get better and better at understanding the \ncharacteristics of borrowers and the collateral in terms of \nsort of what a downpayment or what debt-to-income ratios or any \nother criteria that might emerge years from now. So I think \nthat is sort of problematic, because when it is in legislation, \nthen it is hard to sort of innovate and advance.\n    I also think that the capital standards for the private \ncapital should be able to create very legitimate risk to the \nguarantees, and that will force, in my view, to borrow Senator \nCorker's word, a dynamic underwriting enforcement or mechanism \nthat I think you are looking for through the guarantee, the \nprivate guarantee function. So I would be very opposed to hard-\ncoding underwriting standards.\n    Senator Warren. Good. Thank you.\n    I am going to assume that I am going to get a similar \nanswer, because I want to try to hit a second question. So if I \nam not, you should flag me. OK?\n    Mr. Zandi. Well, I think the loans that are guaranteed by \nthe Government in the system should be QM.\n    Senator Warren. All right. Got it.\n    Mr. Zandi. And that should be hard-coded.\n    Senator Warren. Got it. But it is QM.\n    Mr. Zandi. QM.\n    Senator Warren. Rather than coding in a specific quality.\n    Mr. Zandi. Right. Should be QM, though, because that gets \nrid of a lot of the egregious loan products that are at the \nheart of problems we had.\n    Senator Warren. Right. So I want to ask a different \nquestion then as well, and that is, there are--because there \nare limitations on the scope of the Government guarantee, there \nwill be mortgage-backed securities that are not guaranteed. \nThat is our private-label market. We might make an estimate, \njust to get us started, that that might be something like half \nthe market, $5 trillion. We do not know. I realize it will \ndepend on other factors and likely go up and down.\n    But here is my concern. My worry is that we will have a \nguaranteed market and we will have a private-label market, but \nthat the private-label market will create the same kind of \nproblem that we ended up in in 2008. There is no explicit \nguarantee of the private-label market, but if it is so big and \nso important that the players in the market begin to believe \nthat there is an implicit Government guarantee, that that in \nturn will create the problems of moral hazard, of excessive \nrisk taking, the problems with Fannie and Freddie that got us \nhere in the first place, and all the problems of they scoop up \nthe profits in good times and then leave the taxpayer with the \nbill in bad times.\n    So I am worried about the question of whether or not we \nneed some Government regulation of the nonguaranteed market to \nensure that this kind of aggregation of risk does not occur. \nDr. Zandi?\n    Mr. Zandi. I think it is appropriate for you to be \nconcerned about this, and let me make a broad statement and \nthen a more specific one.\n    Broadly, it is very important to consider housing finance \nreform in the context of the entire mortgage finance system. \nYou know, right now we have just been focused on the part that \nwould get the Government guarantee, but we have to think about \nit in the context of bank lending in terms of the private-label \nsecurities market and what may come from other sources. So we \nhave to think about this--and the FHA, by the way. So we have \nto think about this holistically, and that is one very good \nthing about the PATH Act. It did try to think about it \nholistically. So that is key. So that is a broad statement, and \nso you are exactly right that we should be focused on this.\n    More specifically, I do think that there should be some \nlevers to address this risk. I do think we have QRM. QRM feels \nlike it is going to be set to QM. But I would argue that QRM \nand QM are not coming down from the Mount, right? These are \nthings that we can adjust and set in the future if things seem \nto be going awry, because now regulators are looking at the \nsystem in a--looking at it in terms of systemic risk, that this \nis now a lever we have, the regulators have a lever to change \nit if we need to.\n    The other thing I would say is that the regulator that we \nare talking about here in the context of housing finance reform \nshould have broader authority as well to look at the entire \nsystem and make some changes, if need be. I am just making this \nas an example. You know, I think it might be appropriate that \nwe have a rep and warranty system that is consistent across all \nlending so that, you know, we do not get that bifurcation in \nthe mortgage finance system. And if you do that, then you can \ncontrol for this risk right at the root, you know, in the \norigination process.\n    Now, we have to think this through, and I am thinking out \nloud for you, but--and there may be things I am not thinking \nabout, but I think that is the kind of way I would approach \nthis, yes.\n    Senator Warren. Good. Thank you very much, and thank you \nfor your indulgence, Mr. Chairman. I hope we can pursue this \nlater. Thank you.\n    Chairman Johnson. Senator Shelby."
"shelby","Senator Shelby","toomey","Senator Toomey","    Thank you. Good to see you, Mark.\n    I started wrestling with the GSE reform, as you know, and \nothers probably, about 10 years ago. I had an economist that \nwas advising the Banking Committee at the time I was Chairman \nof the Committee, and she came to me and told me then could she \nhave 30 minutes of my time. I said, ``Absolutely.'' And she \nexplained to me then how thinly capitalized Freddie and Fannie \nwere and how concerned she was and we should be with the \nimplicit guarantee. And also some of the underwriting standards \nhad eroded, so to speak.\n    We tried then to reform Freddie and Fannie. We were not \ntrying to put them out of business. We were trying to build \ntheir capital up and so forth and change some things, to no \navail. Of course, we are where we are today, and that is why we \nare having this hearing.\n    I am concerned about the housing market. Right now Fannie \nand Freddie are about the only game in town. But we still--they \nare sitting in our lap. They are doing a lot better, I think, \nunder the leadership of Mr. DeMarco. They are buying better \nmortgages. Is that fair, Dr. Zandi?\n    Mr. Zandi. Yes, that is fair."
"shelby","Senator Shelby","shelby","Senator Shelby","    All of that?\n    Mr. Zandi. Yes."
"shelby","Senator Shelby","shelby","Senator Shelby","    But still if we are going to reform the \nGSEs, how do we, if we do, limit or can you limit the implicit \nguarantee? See, a lot of us would like to create the private \nsector period, if we could. Is that possible? I do not know it \nis probable. And a lot of people do not want to have capital. \nFannie and Freddie, as I just said, had some of the thinnest \ncapital of any financial institution in the world left \nstanding.\n    Mr. Zandi. Right."
"shelby","Senator Shelby","shelby","Senator Shelby","    Capital itself will not solve everything, \nbut it is a cushion, a big one. Some people argue--and I have \nnot analyzed everything in this proposal by Senators Warner and \nCorker, but we are doing it. Will this legislation--I will \nstart with you, Dr. Zandi. Would this legislation change \ndynamically how the GSEs operate? Or will it be akin to what we \nhad before?\n    Mr. Zandi. It will change it wholesale, Senator. You know, \nI think just to give you context, Fannie and Freddie before the \ncrisis had 50 basis points of capital, 0.5 percentage points, \nand that is being charitable."
"shelby","Senator Shelby","shelby","Senator Shelby","    You could see through it, couldn't you?\n    Mr. Zandi. The quality of the capital was highly \nquestionable."
"shelby","Senator Shelby","shelby","Senator Shelby","    Sure.\n    Mr. Zandi. We are talking about in the Corker-Warner bill \nas written now 10 percent capital, and I am arguing, you know--\n--"
"shelby","Senator Shelby","shelby","Senator Shelby","    I know.\n    Mr. Zandi. Yes. So and then there are many, many other \nchanges in the legislation. So we are talking--and it is an \nexplicit guarantee. It is not implicit. You know, it is right \nthere in our face, and we are saying it is explicit, and we are \ncharging for it, and we have all the appropriate mechanisms for \nensuring that taxpayers get their money back."
"shelby","Senator Shelby","shelby","Senator Shelby","    But won't you have to tie capital, which is \na cushion--is 5 percent maybe not enough? You can argue that. \nOr 10 percent or 8 percent. But adequate capital, good capital, \nwith underwriting standards and so forth. You know, we have--we \nall have preached and pushed for people to have a chance to own \na home here. But, gosh, we found out that everybody cannot or \nwould not want to own a home or would ever make the payments \nand so forth, which is sad in a way. But some people do not \nwant to buy. Our home ownership has gone down some. But isn't \nthe key to any mortgage underwriting the underwriting itself, \nthe credit, the downpayment, what they got in the game, and the \ncapital of the institution, all this tied together?\n    Mr. Zandi. Sure, absolutely. You can have all the capital \nin the world, but if you are making----"
"shelby","Senator Shelby","shelby","Senator Shelby","    Bad loans.\n    Mr. Zandi. It is not going to matter, right? It is going to \nwipe out the capital. So we have to make sure it is not garbage \nin. We have to make sure that it is high-quality mortgages that \nare getting the explicit Government backstop, yes."
"shelby","Senator Shelby","shelby","Senator Shelby","    What is your--and I will give, with the \nhelp of the Chairman maybe, others a chance to answer. You said \nyou believe this is a step in the right direction, you know, \nthis proposed legislation. You have got to have some concerns \nthere. How can we improve this legislation?\n    Mr. Zandi. I do have concerns."
"shelby","Senator Shelby","shelby","Senator Shelby","    OK.\n    Mr. Zandi. Some of it just resolves around the specific \nnumbers. But in terms of structure, I would just mention one \nthing, and that is, I think it is very important that the \ninstitutions that are providing the capital cannot also be \nmaking the loans, that we need a clear break between these \nfunctions. Because if you allow them to combine, then you can \nget a vertically integrate market. What I mean is big \ninstitutions that feel like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that are \ntoo big to fail. So we need to separate those two things, those \ntwo functions, and that has to be clear in the future housing \nfinance system."
"shelby","Senator Shelby","shelby","Senator Shelby","    Heretofore they have been buying the loans, \nhaven't they?\n    Mr. Zandi. Yes. Now, in the current structure, Fannie and \nFreddie do not originate loans. We need to preserve that aspect \nof the current system."
"shelby","Senator Shelby","shelby","Senator Shelby","    OK. Mr. Johns, do you have some \nobservations on this?\n    Mr. Johns. Yes, I think the capital does have to be tied to \nthe underwriting standards. I think we would encourage, you \nknow, if there is going to be a hard-coded number in the \nlegislation, you know, in addition to that you want to have \nsome regulatory flexibility that would allow you to take \naccount of those differences in, you know, not just \nunderwriting standards but any other criteria that should drive \nthe loss number higher."
"shelby","Senator Shelby","shelby","Senator Shelby","    Mr. Lienhard?\n    Mr. Lienhard. I think my concern hinges around the \nexecution. So while we need to move forward in terms of reform \nand the current system is untenable, it is very simple for an \noriginator and the nature of the guarantee is very \nstraightforward. There is no way we will replace that, but we \nwill have multiple options, and those options involve in my \nmind, as I think about implementation, execution risk on the \npart of issuers."
"shelby","Senator Shelby","shelby","Senator Shelby","    Give us a couple of examples.\n    Mr. Lienhard. If you choose the wrong structure, if you \nchoose the wrong guarantee and how that attaches to the TBA \nmarket and how--you know, we simply cannot----"
"shelby","Senator Shelby","shelby","Senator Shelby","    Should that be done by the regulator, the \nstructure, or should we tie it to legislation and put it in a \nstraitjacket?\n    Mr. Lienhard. I think that the regulator is intimately \ninvolved in regulating those structures. That is actually \nreally important. But the legislation should set the tone, and \nI think it is important for the Committee to recognize that, \nyou know, it is not that easy for originators to just simply \nswitch to a new structure or a new provider if, in fact, it is \nturning out that that mechanism is not working well. So I think \nthe choice, the multiple choice and this idea of competition is \na really good one, but the execution associated with sort of \nswitching choices is challenging from an implementation \nperspective."
"shelby","Senator Shelby","shelby","Senator Shelby","    Let me--well, you answer first, Ms. Gordon, \nand then I have got one follow-up.\n    Ms. Gordon. Just a couple of comments on things that have \ncome up throughout your remarks. I do think it is important to \nnote that the erosion of underwriting standards was, in fact, \ninitiated and led by what was happening in the private \nsecuritization market. It was not until toward the end of that \nperiod that Fannie and Freddie, because of their conflicted \nresponsibility--well, because they were chasing profit and \nmarket share, they at that point abandoned what had been very \nsound underwriting standards that had kept the market safe for \nmany years, and that was their big mistake, along with the \ngross undercapitalization that you have talked about.\n    I do think now that we have instituted underwriting \nstandards through QM and risk retention standards through QRM \nthat it is easier to link up this new system to those \nstandards, which will help on the underwriting side, and we \nhave already talked about the capitalization side."
"shelby","Senator Shelby","shelby","Senator Shelby","    Let me ask my last question here. We have \nhad testimony before this Committee before on a number of \noccasions that in the multi-family area, conventional FHA, but \nconventional, too, that there are very few foreclosures. Very \nfew. And I know that is--we are not talking about apples and \noranges. We are talking about big apples and smaller apples \nhere, I think. And I know that their underwriting is very \nimportant in multi-family for the most part, especially \nconventional. You have got to have some skin in the game. But \nis the lack of skin in the game--in other words, lack of \ndownpayment underwriting--that causes some of our problem? Dr. \nZandi? As opposed to multi-family.\n    Mr. Zandi. Yes, I mean, I think in the single-family \nsystem, pre-crisis, currently, there is not enough skin in the \ngame. We do not have enough capital, private capital. We do not \nrequire the folks that are receiving the mortgages and \nbenefiting from issuing the mortgages to fully participate in \nthe risk. So that is what we need to fix, and if we get that \nright, I think we will have a much sounder system with lower \ndefault rates and, you know, address some of the concerns that \nSenator Toomey has with regard to moral hazard."
"shelby","Senator Shelby","shelby","Senator Shelby","    Mr. Johns, do you have anything?\n    Mr. Johns. Are you talking about skin in the game from \nthe----"
"shelby","Senator Shelby","shelby","Senator Shelby","    Downpayment.\n    Mr. Johns. From the consumer perspective."
"shelby","Senator Shelby","shelby","Senator Shelby","    Equity. In other words, if I--I remember \nanecdotally, I remember when I was very young--and that was a \nlong time ago, but my wife and I bought our first house, built \nour first house, which we still live in. We want to pay as much \ndown as we could to make the payments lower and also to pay it \noff as soon as we could, because we came from parents who came \nout of the Depression. They did not want debt. You understand \nthat well. Now a lot of people do not want to pay anything \ndown, even if they could. So I am speaking of skin the game.\n    Mr. Johns. OK. So I think on that side I would support what \nDr. Zandi is saying. It is an interesting sort of dichotomy \nbecause obviously you will have--we have many members within \nthe Structured Finance Industry Group. You range from the \nissuers to servicers and the originators, and you have \ninvestors at one side. Clearly there is a balance of play there \nfrom a market perspective as to, you know, the more skin in the \ngame that a homeowner has, then, you know, clearly there is \nless likelihood of default. At the same time, if you add that \nrequirement to can you access the market, then it may reduce \nthe amount of originations that you have that you can clear \naway and get low-cost funding for.\n    So, you know, as an organization, it is something that we \nare very aware of. You know, if we look at the risk retention \nrules that have sort of recently come out, clearly it is an \nissue that will be debated over the next couple of months \nuntil, I think--at least until the common letters are submitted \non October 30, and I would be happy to come back and give you a \nfull read on where the industry as a whole sits on that.\n    Chairman Johnson. Could the Senator think about wrapping \nup?"
"shelby","Senator Shelby","shelby","Senator Shelby","    I will conclude. You have been very \ngenerous with my time and yours, too. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Chairman Johnson. Senator Heitkamp?"
"heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","shelby","Senator Shelby","    We all know how you feel, waiting to be \nlast. We are in a spot where we have choices, and if we get \nbogged down on political ideology, we will make the choice to \ndo nothing. Because I have been around here long enough now in \nmy short time period to know that when we get into \nphilosophical debates, we do not do reform. We do not do the \nthings that we need to do to give certainty to the market, to \ngive certainty to the American people, and to respond to their \nconcerns.\n    So I am going to ask one very broad question, which is \nthree choices: Do nothing, which seems to be the kind of choice \nof default in Washington, D.C., as we bog down in philosophical \ndebates. We have got the PATH Act, which shows that this is \ngoing to be market driven. Very little information--and maybe I \nam just not looking in the right places, but very little \ninformation about the consequences on the American middle class \nand home ownership and new families as a result of the lack of \nexpression of explicit Federal guarantee and the availability \nof the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage into the future. And we \nhave got a hybrid. We have got an opportunity to do real \nreform, and I know that there are so many of you on this panel \nwho have participated in that discussion. Great work. I have \nread a lot of the work that has come out of your organization \nand I really appreciate it. For somebody who brings maybe a new \nperspective to this issue, it has been extraordinarily helpful. \nAnd so those are our three choices. Obviously the bill that we \nare considering today is the hybrid. It is that choice.\n    I want to ask you, Doctor, where can we better inform the \nAmerican public about the actual consequences to our middle \nclass and to our citizens on the consequences of those three \nchoices? Where do we go for that information? Because I know \nyou have been asked here kind of pick a choice or do a \ncritique, and that was going to be my question, which is do a \ncritique between the PATH Act and what we have in front of us \nin terms of affordability and availability of home ownership. \nBut I want to know who is going to do that work so that we can \nbetter inform the public.\n    Mr. Zandi. Well, I think the thing that would resonate with \npeople is, you know, how much is this going to cost me? You \nknow, what does it mean for my monthly mortgage payment? And--\n--"
"heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","    If I can just interrupt, it may also be, \nCan I get a mortgage?\n    Mr. Zandi. That as well, sure, absolutely. But I think if \nwe can come up with that number under different pieces of \nlegislation, that would be quite informative. You know, I have \ntaken a crack at that. I have done that for the PATH Act. I \nhave done that for Corker-Warner, under different \ncapitalization assumptions. And, of course, there are a lot of \nmoving parts. But we have done that work. We can make it better \nand refine it as the legislation improves, but----"
"heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","    And can you give some insight on your \nconclusions as a result of that work?\n    Mr. Zandi. Yes. So if we go from the current system to \nwhere I think the system should be, 5 percent capitalization, \nthat would add roughly $60 to the monthly mortgage payment.\n    If we go to a 10 percent capitalization--so this is what is \nin Corker-Warner right now--that would probably add another $60 \nto the monthly mortgage payment. So it would be $120 from where \nwe are today. And, again, a lot of moving parts and a lot of \nassumptions.\n    If we go to the PATH Act, then--and I am going to do this \ncalculation for you precisely, but I am just going to give you \na sense of the ballpark estimate. I do not want to be on the \nrecord saying a specific number and be wrong, but it is \nprobably double that. You know, it is probably $240 a month \nfrom where we are today. So it is a significant increase in the \ncost.\n    And, obviously, those are big numbers, right? I mean, just \nadd it up. And that means that for the average typical home \nbuyer, it is going to be a lot harder to get a mortgage. And \nthen for the people--and those numbers I just gave you, that is \nfor the typical borrower. That is for the person that is right \ndown in the middle of the distribution of borrowers in a normal \neconomic environment. If you go to the person--take QM and go \nto the end of the box, you know, the guy that is just marginal, \nstill qualifies but is marginal, in a bad economy, in a \nrecession, let us say, then the cost is going to be higher than \nthat, measurably higher than that.\n    So these decisions you are making really mean a lot for \nAmericans. I mean, 65 percent of Americans own a home. You are \ngoing to affect them."
"heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","    And I see I am out of time, but I just \nwant to reiterate the point that for so many Americans, their \nhome has not just been a house. It has also been their \ninvestment, banking on the availability. And as we look at a \nreduction in the number of companies, in fact, an elimination \nin the number of people--entities in the private sector who are \nwilling to do a defined benefit plan anymore, we are all now \nsaving for our future. I worry greatly how all of this will \naffect retirements into the future, how all of this will affect \nour ability to supplement our older income. And so this is \nenormously important, not just to the American economy, but it \nis enormously important to Americans that we get this right. \nAnd I think, you know, we have this Committee, at least the 10 \nof us who have sponsored this legislation, take a look at this \nand say if we do nothing, this place will not result in reform. \nAnd that may be the worst outcome for the people who most \ndisagree with this provision.\n    And so I just want to--you all have had an enormous \nopportunity, I think, here to provide input. I hope that you \nwill continue that, and I thank you for the work that you have \ndone on behalf of the American people and on behalf of the \nAmerican economy. It has been extraordinary, and I have really \nenjoyed listening.\n    Chairman Johnson. Thank you again to all of our witnesses \nfor being here today. Your testimony will help guide our \nhearings going forward. I look forward to continuing this \ndiscussion and working with Senator Crapo and all of my \ncolleagues on the Committee to achieve an agreement on housing \nfinance reform.\n    This hearing is adjourned."

"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","  <bullet>  First, while there is a need to reform the housing finance \n        system, it is critical to retain the basic ``plumbing'' of the \n        system that draws in enormous sums of investment capital and \n        provides borrowers with rate certainty. These features can be \n        retained in a mortgage market that serves the interests of \n        borrowers and taxpayers alike."
break,break,break,break
"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","  <bullet>  Second, reform must bring more private capital into the \n        mortgage market in a principal loss position without reducing \n        the global demand for mortgage-backed securities and while \n        providing competitive access for small and medium-sized \n        institutions that serve millions of homeowners."
break,break,break,break
"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","    I will spend a few minutes elaborating on each of these points.\n    Out of thousands of mortgage loans that we make every year, on \naverage, we hold only one in six on our balance sheet. So while we own \n$30 billion worth of mortgage loans, we actually originated and service \nmore than $140 billion in mortgages involving more than 800,000 \nhouseholds. This is possible for us, and other regional banks, due to \nthe existence of the secondary mortgage market.\n    This vast majority of the mortgages we originate for sale in the \nsecondary market are either ``conforming'' loans, meaning they comply \nwith the guidelines set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; FHA loans, which \ncomply with the insurance terms established by the Federal Housing \nAdministration in HUD; or VA loans eligible for the Veterans \nAdministration's guaranty program.\n    The process by which we price and close the loan and package it for \nthe secondary market are important to a well-informed discussion \nrelating to housing finance reform.\n    Our clients come to SunTrust Mortgage through our branches, on-line \nor through our network of loan officers and institutional mortgage \npartners. We listen closely, assess needs, and thoroughly explain the \nfull range of products that we have available to our clients.\n    To provide the client with basic information regarding how much \nthey can afford to pay for a house, we must be able to tell them the \ninterest rate and the monthly cost of the loan. You can't buy a house \nif you don't know what your mortgage payment will be.\n    We do this by referencing a daily pricing sheet that provides the \ninterest rate and loan terms that can be offered on a guaranteed basis. \nThese prices are set from the price of MBS trading in the ``To Be \nAnnounced'' (TBA) market. TBA security prices assume delivery of \nconforming mortgages into a Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae mortgage-backed \nsecurity on a forward basis. The forward-pricing mechanism of the \nsecondary market allows us to lock in the interest rate for clients for \nup to 90 days.\n    Once we lock an interest rate, we proceed through the mortgage \nlending process. Acting as an agent for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we \nmake sure the client's mortgage is properly qualified, underwritten, \ndocumented, settled and delivered using GSE guidelines and \nrequirements. This requires expertise and very detailed execution.\n    But it all starts with the certainty we have regarding how we are \nfunding the mortgage. Without that certainty, primary market lenders \nwould be unwilling and unable to provide forward price certainty to \nborrowers. The MBS market solves the ``chicken or egg'' problem of \nfunding risk by allowing lenders to set mortgage loan delivery terms up \nfront, while allowing execution and delivery to follow.\n    Through the combination of mortgage standardization and the \nfunction of the MBS market, the existing system provides a tangible \nbenefit to borrowers. And these benefits are available for borrowers \nwho transact with originators of any size: local banks, Main Street \nbanks such as SunTrust, as well as the largest mortgage originators.\n    While there is a need to address taxpayer risk by making structural \nchanges to the housing finance system, the securitization platform, the \nstandard-setting on lending and documentation and the servicing \nrequirements are absolutely essential to maintaining a secondary \nmarket. This infrastructure is so foundational that we must emerge from \nhousing finance reform with these key functions intact.\n    Let me conclude with a few remarks on the critical issue of the \nstructure of the credit guarantee. Our markets perform so well in large \npart because credit risk associated with mortgage default is assumed by \nthe GSEs. Investors from around the world allocate trillions of dollars \nof capital to our market because it only involves interest rate risk.\n    The problem, of course, is that providing credit protection puts \ntaxpayers at risk. Using private sources of capital to cover credit \nexposure can help alleviate taxpayer risk.\n    However, if changes are made to the credit guarantee function, it \nmust work well for investors. It must also operate transparently and \nwith scale. The U.S. mortgage market involves trillions of dollars. \nThis quantity of private capital required to backstop the market is \nvery significant. If that market shrinks dramatically, so does lending \nto borrowers.\n    We must also consider that if a variety of credit risk devices \nemerge in place of the relatively simple credit guarantee we have \ntoday, it could make mortgage-backed securities difficult for investors \nto value, fracturing the investor base, reducing liquidity and \nincreasing costs.\n    To the extent that private capital is intended to stand before any \ntaxpayer-backed guarantees, the entities and instruments must be \nsubject to regulatory oversight. If regulators cannot understand nor \nkeep track of the various risk sharing mechanisms, there is a danger \nthat they will not perform as needed under crises conditions.\n    Finally, any new source of private sector credit protection should \nbe available for all primary market lenders--including large, small and \nMain Street institutions. If certain entities cannot obtain competitive \naccess to credit protection in the secondary market, they will have a \ngreat difficulty competing in the primary market. Measures that create \nadvantages for the very largest issuers of MBS, or make the cost of \nmarket access more expensive for some and not others, will reduce \ncompetition and must be avoided. Additionally, any new framework should \nmaximize the secondary market liquidity in the new MBS to ensure that \nregulated financial institutions are able to participate as investors, \nuse the securities as liquid assets, and pledge them as collateral.\n    Let me conclude by thanking the Committee again for its time, \nattention and consideration. We stand ready to provide you with any \nassistance or advice you may need as your important work continues. I \nlook forward to answering any of your questions.\n                                 ______"

"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","    My name is Richard Johns. I am the Executive Director of the \nStructured Finance Industry Group, Inc. (``SFIG''), a trade industry \neducation and advocacy group established in March 2013 that presently \nis comprised of over 160 corporate members from all sectors of the \nstructured finance and securitization market, including investors, \nissuers, financial intermediaries, law firms, accounting firms, \ntechnology firms, rating agencies, servicers, and trustees. A key \nelement of SFIG's mission is to educate and advocate on behalf of the \nstructured finance and securitization industry with respect to policy, \nlegal, regulatory and other matters affecting or potentially affecting \nthe structured finance, securitization and related capital markets. It \nis with that mission in mind that I thank you for this opportunity to \naddress the Committee regarding proposed housing finance reforms, \nincluding the role to be played by the Government in the housing \nfinance system and the importance of returning private capital to the \nmortgage market.\n    As this Committee continues its examination of potential reforms to \nour system of housing finance, SFIG welcomes the opportunity to provide \ncommentary and analysis, particularly as it relates to the impact of \nvarious reform options on the securitization markets. Before I proceed, \nI want to acknowledge the effort of all those who are working to make \nreasonable but necessary reforms to the housing finance system. SFIG \nbelieves that the reform process must proceed in a measured and \ndeliberate way, and we appreciate the Committee's methodical approach \nin considering reforms that are so inherently critical to the U.S. \nhousing market and the economy as a whole. As an organizing principle \nfor this process, we suggest that there are three sequential stages \nthat any reform effort should follow in order to preserve the TBA (``To \nBe Announced'') Market. First, a conversion into a common TBA should be \nadopted, making Fannie and Freddie MBS fungible and therefore \ndeliverable into a single TBA Market, eliminating current pricing and \nliquidity inefficiencies in the Agency Market.\\1\\ Second, any reform \nlegislation should provide for the creation of a single agency security \nthat not only would facilitate the conversion and continued liquidity \nof legacy securities but also would promote a deep and liquid new-issue \nMBS market. Third, a common securitization platform should be \nestablished for the purpose of overseeing and maintaining the \nstandardization of the market for Government-guaranteed MBS. With that \norganizing principle in mind, SFIG believes that there are a number of \nissues that must be addressed in any reform process, specifically:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\1\\ In order for a common TBA to be implemented successfully, a \nnumber of issues need to be considered and addressed, and SFIG believes \noriginators, financial intermediaries and investors must play a major \nrole in that process."

"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","  <bullet>  An integral part of any reform will be to ensure the \n        continued liquidity of the TBA Market, which is the most \n        efficient and cheapest mechanism to enable a mortgage consumer \n        to ``lock in'' the interest rate at the time when a mortgage \n        loan is approved and thereby minimize the cost of borrowing. \n        The TBA Market also creates efficiencies and cost savings for \n        lenders that are passed on to borrowers in the form of lower \n        rates. Currently, the TBA Market is reliant in part on the \n        existence of Government-guaranteed MBS, making it imperative \n        that any reform legislation include provisions that preserve \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        some form of a Government guarantee."

"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","  <bullet>  The best approach to risk sharing in a reformed housing \n        finance system would be for private capital to assume the first \n        risk of loss, the proper amount of which should be flexibly \n        assessed in light of market factors, while retaining an \n        explicit Government backstop against catastrophic loss. The \n        retention of the catastrophic Government guarantee is critical \n        to ensuring the continued participation of institutional ``rate \n        investors,'' which provide a majority of the capital currently \n        invested in the Agency Market."
break,break,break,break
"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","  <bullet>  The transition from the status quo to a new housing finance \n        structure must be transparent, appropriate to market \n        conditions, and handled with great care to minimize any \n        disruptions to the flow of credit to consumers, and in \n        particular to ensure the continued functioning of a healthy TBA \n        Market. Of utmost concern is that steps must be taken to allow \n        the fulfillment of existing commitments (including contracts \n        for future delivery) and preserve the market for legacy \n        securities (i.e., outstanding Government-guaranteed MBS), while \n        allowing sufficient time for eligible loans under the reformed \n        system to be generated and take hold in the TBA Market. SFIG \n        believes that the best way to facilitate this transition would \n        be to create a single agency security to which legacy \n        securities would be converted and which Fannie and Freddie \n        could begin issuing even before a single securitization \n        platform is fully functional. This would allow for cost savings \n        as well as greater liquidity in the TBA Market. Failure to take \n        such steps not only would discourage investors from \n        participating in both the leftover and post-reform TBA Market, \n        but it also would create substantial mortgage funding issues."

"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","    Moreover, more than 90 percent of Government-guaranteed MBS trading \nvolume occurs in the TBA Market. Accordingly, any reforms must be \ncomplemented by steps to ensure the TBA Market's continuing efficiency \nand liquidity.\n    The TBA Market creates efficiencies and cost savings for lenders \nthat are passed on to borrowers in the form of lower rates. It also is \nthe most efficient and cheapest mechanism to enable a consumer to \n``lock in'' the interest rate at the time when the loan is approved, \nrather than take the risk that interest rates will rise between \napproval of the loan and the closing of the loan, which would increase \nthe cost of the mortgage loan to the consumer and possibly make it \nunaffordable. The TBA Market does this through a system of forward \ntrades of mortgage loan pools for guaranteed MBS that facilitates the \nshifting of interest rate risk into the capital markets. Thus, \noriginators can offer consumers this ability to ``lock in'' mortgage \nrates by hedging the risk that interest rates will rise between \napplication and closing. In this way, the TBA Market allows for \nstability between the time of loan origination and loan closing, \nensuring that the terms of a mortgage loan do not fluctuate due to \nmacroeconomic changes and reducing costs to consumers.\n    The distinguishing trait of trades in the TBA Market is their \nhomogeneity (i.e., standardized underwriting criteria and loan \nfeatures, the Government guarantee, the geographic diversification \nincorporated into the pooling process, the limited number of issuers, \nthe simple structure of ``pass-through'' security features, and the \nrestriction of the range of interest rates on loans deliverable into a \nsingle security). The parties to the trades agree only on certain \ncriteria of the securities to be delivered: issuer, maturity, coupon, \nprice, par amount, and settlement date. The actual securities to be \ndelivered at trade settlement are not specified on the date the \ntransaction is executed. Rather, just before the settlement date, the \nseller notifies the buyer of the specific securities that will satisfy \nthe TBA agreement.\n    Because TBA buyers are indifferent as to the specific securities \ndelivered, originators are able to easily and inexpensively cover their \nhedges should they originate less collateral than expected in any given \nperiod, significantly reducing the cost to hedge and rate lock. \nMoreover, since the TBA Market simplifies the analytical and risk \nmanagement challenges for participants, a broader group of investors \nparticipates in the TBA Market than would otherwise participate if \ninvestment decisions were more complex. The additional investors-\nspecifically foreign central banks, mutual funds and hedge funds-inject \nmore capital into the market for financing mortgages and ultimately \nreduce the cost of capital to consumers.\n    Homogeneity is what makes the TBA Market possible, specifically, \nthe fungibility of the conforming loan product (through standardized \nunderwriting criteria and loan features) and a Government guarantee, \nwhich equalizes credit risk. Additionally, due to the specific \nexemption from SEC shelf registration requirements applicable to \nGovernment-guaranteed securities, specific collateral need not be \nidentified, thus allowing forward selling. It is not possible to \nreplicate the TBA Market without these factors. Any reform which does \nnot accommodate, or suitably replace, the existing TBA Market will \nundoubtedly impact mortgage originators and consumers both severely and \nnegatively by reducing price transparency, liquidity, and the \noriginators' options to rate lock and thus satisfy consumer needs.\n    In short, the TBA Market removes uncertainty from the mortgage \norigination business and keeps mortgage rates low for potential \nborrowers. As noted in a report published by the Federal Reserve Bank \nof New York, ``the TBA market serves a valuable role in the mortgage \nfinance system,'' and ``evaluations of proposed reforms to U.S. housing \nfinance should take into account potential effects of those reforms on \nthe operation of the TBA market and its liquidity.'' TBA Trading and \nLiquidity in the Agency MBS Market, James Vickery and Joshua Wright, \nFRBNY Economic Policy Review, May 2013.\n    One factor that any reform must account for is that the TBA Market \nis reliant in part on the existence of MBS that are guaranteed by the \nGovernment. For that reason, the TBA Market is extremely sensitive to \nany changes to the role that the Government will have in the housing \nfinance system going forward. Indeed, the TBA Market could not be \nrecreated without the features discussed above that are unique to \nGovernment-guaranteed MBS. Accordingly, SFIG believes that the \nmaintenance of a partial, second-loss Government backstop against \ncatastrophic loss for MBS is crucial to preserving the health of the \nTBA Market and continuing to promote stability and affordable interest \nrates for consumers in different market cycles.\nTHE HOUSING FINANCE SYSTEM WORKS BEST WHEN THERE IS RISK-SHARING AMONG \n        PARTICIPANTS.\n    Mortgage securitization is by nature a process by which the risks \nassociated with residential mortgage lending are spread among various \ninvestors with differing appetites for risk. Attracting private capital \nto undertake these risks is of critical importance to the consumer and \nthe economy as a whole. The Government has always guaranteed a large \npercentage of residential mortgage securitization, but historically the \nmarket also included securitizations funded solely by private capital \nwith no explicit Government guarantee. These two markets cater to two \ndifferent types of investors distinguished by the type of risk that \neach is willing to undertake, specifically, ``rate risk'' and ``credit \nrisk.'' For this reason, any reforms that aim to limit the Government's \ninvolvement in the Agency Market by changing or ending the current \ninfrastructure must account for the impact that such changes will have \non the flow of private capital that historically has favored \nGovernment-guaranteed MBS.\n    As noted, there are two main risks associated with residential \nmortgage lending. The first, called market or rate risk, results from \ninterest rate changes. After the interest rate on a residential \nmortgage loan is set (for example, the interest rate on a fixed-rate \nresidential mortgage), that mortgage loan becomes less valuable over \ntime if current residential mortgage rates rise, because the owner of \nthat mortgage loan earns less in interest than it would if it owned a \nmortgage loan at the current (higher) market rate of interest. In \naddition, a consumer generally has the right to prepay his residential \nmortgage loan at any time (for example, if the consumer decides to sell \nthe home), which may reduce the economic upside to the owner of the \nmortgage loan. Furthermore, refinancing of residential mortgages \ngenerally occurs when interest rates fall. The specific market risks \nassociated with owning residential mortgage loans are dependent on the \nprecise terms and types of mortgage loans.\n    The second risk associated with mortgage lending is credit risk. \nCredit risk consists of two components: (1) default risk; and (2) loss \nseverity risk. Default risk is the risk that the consumer fails to \nrepay the loan. Loss severity risk is the risk that, after a consumer \ndefaults, the lender will not recoup all of the principal lent and the \nexpected interest on that principal.\n    Private capital ``rates investors'' are willing to bear the rate \nrisk and prepayment risk, but seek to avoid credit risk, because these \ninvestors operate under investment guidelines, capital requirements, \nand liquidity requirements that preclude them from purchasing private-\nlabel securities in any significant concentration. Examples of rates \ninvestors are foreign central banks, domestic banks and mutual funds. \nHistorically, ``rates investors'' have been attracted to Government-\nguaranteed MBS--in which the Government bears the bulk of the credit \nrisk--and they have contributed trillions of dollars to the Agency \nMarket because of those guarantees. By contrast, ``credit investors'' \nsuch as insurance companies and investment funds have fewer constraints \non taking credit risk, and may in fact actively seek it out in exchange \nfor higher potential returns.\n    Limiting the Government's involvement in the market by changing or \nending the current infrastructure must account for the critical \ncontribution that rates investors make to the Agency Market and their \nhistoric aversion to credit risk, as well as the limited pool of \nprivate capital available to fund credit risk. Accordingly, SFIG \nbelieves that retention of a catastrophic-loss Government backstop is \nessential to maintaining and increasing the participation of rates \ninvestors in the Agency Market. Indeed, SFIG believes that the TBA \nMarket and the rates market for MBS cannot function without such a \nguarantee.\n    However, we also acknowledge that private investors have a role to \nplay in insuring against the credit risks posed by residential \nmortgages. To that end, SFIG generally supports the approach of having \nprivate capital take on credit risk, while also having a Government \nguarantee that is explicit and priced in a reasonable manner. Any risk-\nsharing structure should be carefully reviewed to ensure that the TBA \nMarket is not disrupted. Furthermore, we believe that private capital \nshould be placed in the first-loss position, with the private credit \nenhancement being calculated to cover reasonable risks presented by the \nmarket and the Government backstop covering catastrophic risk, i.e., \nthe Government guarantee will generally be called upon only when the \noperation of the secondary mortgage market as a whole is at risk.\n    SFIG supports a variety of mechanisms to bring private capital into \nthe mortgage market, including corporate guarantees and capital markets \ntransactions. Various forms of capital should be allowed to compete on \na level playing field that balances sufficient risk retention at each \nstep of the origination process to align incentives with the separation \nof functions and responsibility necessary to attract diverse capital \nsources.\n    As for the amount of risk that a private investor should be \nrequired to assume, SFIG believes that the 10 percent first risk of \nloss provided for in S. 1217 is too high, as shown in the chart \nbelow.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\3\\ Source: Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, \nHousing Finance, September 2013, at 10.\n<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>"

"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","    We suggest that, if the Committee is determined to include some \nminimum level of risk assumption in the legislation, the level be \nconsidered a ``target'' that the Committee establishes based on \nunderwriting-related factors, such as historical loss data in the TBA \nmarket. Furthermore, the regulators should have the discretion to \ndeviate from the target based upon their own assessment of qualitative \nrisk factors.\n    The regulators will have to take a variety of complex factors into \naccount to ensure that the private credit enhancement is rationally \nsized at a level that is commensurate with the qualitative attributes \nof risk-sharing structures. These factors include readily available \nhistoric information, the likely loan types, general housing/economic \nindicators, any applicable representations and warranties, and whether \nthe various forms of insurance and guarantees--e.g., the combination of \nhomeowner's equity and mortgage insurance, Mortgage Insurance Fund \ncoverage, and the Government catastrophic guarantee--may be duplicative \nand overlapping due to counterparty risk, thereby reducing the amount \nof risk that private investors should assume.\n    We believe that if the required private credit enhancement is too \nhigh and vastly exceeds the loss expectations of the associated assets, \nthe redundant enhancement creates the potential for distortion. \nOriginators must find a way to pay for the enhancement, and the \navailable options may not be good for the consumer or housing market. \nFor example, an originator may simply pass the cost of the redundant \nenhancement directly through to consumers via increased rates, thereby \nundermining one of the primary benefits that the Agency Market affords \nconsumers, namely, lower cost loans. And even if such steps are taken, \nthe possibility remains that there might not be sufficient private \ncapital in the market to satisfy a private credit enhancement level \nthat exceeds what is necessary to address the actual risk factors.\nTHE TRANSITION TO A NEW HOUSING FINANCE STRUCTURE SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED \n        GRADUALLY AND WITH GREAT CARE.\n    The transition from the status quo to a new housing finance \nstructure must be handled with great care to minimize any disruptions \nto the flow of credit to consumers. The transition process should be \ncarefully implemented, and to avoid severe market disruption should \nallow for: (1) a clear and transparent plan for transition; (2) a \ndetermination that market conditions are appropriate for the \ntransition; (3) the fulfillment of existing commitments (including \ncontracts for future delivery); (4) a determination that issues \nrelating to legacy securities have been appropriately handled; (5) time \nto generate eligible loans; (6) testing or piloting the new structure \nin a real market environment; and (7) continuation of the TBA Market.\n    SFIG's primary transition-related concern centers on ensuring that \nwhatever system is put in place, it performs and functions properly and \ncontinues to facilitate a robust TBA Market. It is imperative that \nsteps be taken both to preserve the market for legacy securities (i.e., \noutstanding Government-guaranteed MBS), while allowing sufficient time \nfor eligible loans under the reformed system to be generated and take \nhold in the TBA Market. Otherwise, the post-reform TBA Market will \nstall as: (1) investors in legacy securities are left with orphaned \nsecurities that continue to lose value as they factor down and their \nmarket becomes smaller and smaller; and (2) the market for new agency \nsecurities takes time to ramp up.\n    SFIG believes that the surest method of facilitating a smooth \ntransition is to allow for a conversion mechanism such that existing \nGovernment-guaranteed MBS are interchangeable with the new Government-\nguaranteed MBS. Fannie and Freddie could begin issuing a single \nmortgage-backed security even before the single securitization platform \nis fully functional. This would allow for cost savings as well as \ngreater liquidity. Failure to take this step not only would discourage \ninvestors from participating in both the leftover and post-reform TBA \nMarkets, but it also would create substantial mortgage funding issues \nas liquidity diminishes.\n    SFIG also believes that all market participants would benefit to \nthe extent that the current and new infrastructures operate in tandem \nfor some period of time, or, in the alternative, appropriate portions \nof the current infrastructure are utilized by the new infrastructure. \nIn addition, a final wind down of Fannie and Freddie should happen only \nafter the new framework has been sufficiently tested and we can all be \nconfident that it will facilitate the continued functioning of the TBA \nMarket.\n    We believe that these and other operational and delivery issues \nthat will arise from the winding down of the existing framework and the \nramping up of the new framework should be minimized by actively \nengaging directly with the relevant industry participants to determine \nthe appropriate balance of regulatory discretion and legislative \nguidance regarding how the transition should proceed, as well as \nmaintaining consistency (to the extent feasible) among the MBS issued \nacross the platforms.\nSTANDARDIZATION IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONING OF THE REFORMED TBA \n        MARKET.\n    Any new infrastructure for the trading of Government-guaranteed \nsecurities will necessarily include requirements for areas such as \ndisclosure, documentation, data collection and overall standardization \nof Government-guaranteed MBS transactions. Indeed, standardization of \ndocuments (e.g., standard Government loan forms), structuring and \nunderwriting (e.g., conforming loan limits, document verification, \netc.) is critical to the TBA Market because it increases fungibility \nand liquidity of Government-guaranteed MBS. These requirements should \nbe very transparent, take into consideration the needs of all parties \nto the transactions, and include investor protections. Important to \nthis standardization of the market will be establishing common \ninfrastructure in the form of a common securitization platform that \nwill lower barriers to entry for new participants into the system and \nenable different entities to issue a single security without variation.\n    We would also caution that standards and practices that may or may \nnot be appropriate for the new Government-guaranteed securities may not \nbe appropriate for private-label securities given the wide variety of \nloan types, origination practices, servicing contracts, deal structures \nand the difference in negotiating power of transaction participants. \nThe newly reemerging private-label RMBS market should not be expected \nto align completely with the rules and standards that are developed for \nthe new Government-guaranteed securities. As noted above, the two \nmarkets cater to two different types of investors.\nLEGISLATION SHOULD NOT SPECIFY THE TYPES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND \n        WARRANTIES TO BE USED IN THE NEW HOUSING FINANCE SYSTEM.\n    We do not believe that language specifying the types of \nrepresentations, warranties, enforcement provisions and recourse to be \nused in the new housing finance system should be prescribed in \nlegislation. Rather, these are matters that should be left to the \ndiscretion of regulators. SFIG is actively focused on evaluating \ndifferent representation, warranty, enforcement and recourse approaches \nthat have arisen in the private-label RMBS market. We have also begun a \ndialog with regulators and agencies regarding this topic to explore how \nthe Government might incorporate our analyses into its current efforts. \nAreas of particular interest include common securitization platform, \nsecondary market viability of loans that do not meet Qualified \nMortgage-Safe Harbor and Qualified Residential Mortgage standards, \nRegulation AB 2 proposals and due diligence, data, breach, repurchase \nand other disclosures.\nAFFORDABLE HOME OWNERSHIP SHOULD BE PURSUED THROUGH A SEPARATE, \n        EXPLICIT PROGRAM DEDICATED TO THAT GOAL.\n    SFIG agrees that all segments of American society should have the \nopportunity to become home owners and that the Government can and \nshould play an important role in making that goal a reality. However, \nwe do not agree with the current system, which has led to implicit \nsubsidies in the form of purchases of subprime loans from \nnoncreditworthy consumers. Instead, SFIG believes that Congress should \nexplicitly promote affordable housing through a stand-alone program not \nlinked in any way to the operation of the secondary mortgage market, \nand should fund that program through separate legislative mechanisms.\n    On the flip side of the equation, we also agree that the current \nupper limits for Government-guaranteed loans should be reduced, to \nensure that the market is focused on the segment of consumers for whom \nthe Government guarantee is most essential in obtaining reasonably \npriced residential mortgages.\nCONCLUSION\n    The issues confronting the Committee as it considers reforms to the \nhousing finance system are critical not only to the health of the \nnation's housing market, but to the growth of the nation's economy \ngenerally. While we recognize the need to correct the errors of the \npast, we urge the Committee not to lose sight of the ways in which the \nAgency Market has worked well, and continues to work well (such as \nthrough the TBA Market), to facilitate the ability of Americans to \nenjoy the benefits of home ownership. To that end, we encourage the \nCommittee to strive to retain the mechanisms, such as the Government \nguarantee, that have succeeded in bringing vast amounts of private \ncapital into the housing market, while it takes steps to more equitably \nand effectively distribute the risks related to residential mortgages.\n    We look forward to working with the Committee as it considers these \nvitally important issues. Thank you again for the opportunity to share \nSFIG's views.\n<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>"

break,break,break,break
"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","Q.1. During the hearing the issue of capital markets execution, \nas opposed to bond guarantor ``entity'' execution, was \ndiscussed. Could you briefly discuss the advantages of allowing \nmultiple sources of capital--from both the equity and fixed-\nincome markets--take on credit risk? And to the extent you have \nconcerns, if you have them, please make suggestions for how we \nmight alleviate those concerns?"
break,break,break,break
"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","A.1. Thank you for your question and the opportunity to weigh \nin on this important issue. I do not believe any advantages \ntheoretically provided by the opportunity for multiple \nexecutions outweighs the potential disadvantages of providing a \nGovernment wrap to individual structured transactions. As I \nhighlighted in my testimony, I'm concerned about the capital \nmarkets execution for several reasons:"
break,break,break,break
"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","  <bullet> LA system based on bond guarantors or other \n        ``entities'' is significantly easier to regulate for \n        safety and soundness. Not only will there be fewer \n        entities to monitor, but the insurance that bond \n        guarantors will provide is more easily understood by a \n        regulator than diverse and complex structured \n        transactions."
break,break,break,break
"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","  <bullet> LBond guarantors are much more efficient at pooling \n        and spreading risks, which is the core function of \n        insurance. Structured transactions, to the extent that \n        they cover a single or limited number of pools, cannot \n        allocate risks and reserves across years, regions, \n        lenders, and so on."
break,break,break,break
"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","  <bullet> LAs we have seen in recent private-label \n        securitizations, investors in structured transactions \n        have proven unwilling to assume risk on anything but \n        the most pristine mortgages. If investors are assuming \n        the first-loss risk, their high level of scrutiny will \n        result in higher prices for nontraditional but still \n        creditworthy borrowers, as the investors will demand a \n        premium for taking risk that is not well-understood or \n        serving borrowers who are perceived as more risky."
break,break,break,break
"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","  <bullet> LIndividual deals are much less likely to be able to \n        support a robust TBA market, as they do not offer the \n        same level of homogeneity in contract terms and the \n        structures likely will require high levels of loan \n        level disclosures. These higher levels of disclosure \n        will reduce liquidity by fracturing the market into \n        more individually priced securities that will not be \n        suitable for the fungible TBA market. Even if a system \n        can be found to permit the forward trading that \n        characterizes the current TBA market, the lack of \n        homogeneity over time/across different vintages of \n        loans will reduce liquidity."
break,break,break,break
"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","  <bullet> LEven if the structured transactions are \n        ``funded''--as in, the money to cover losses is \n        advanced to the instrument's issuer--it will be hard to \n        ascertain how these assets are accounted for on the \n        balance sheets of the involved parties. As a result, \n        risk could simply be exported out of the four corners \n        of the MBS into the larger financial sector. Recent and \n        on-going experience with regulating derivatives and \n        capital markets risk-sharing structures illustrates the \n        difficulties in even understanding how risks are \n        actually shared, let alone less in regulating them."
break,break,break,break
"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","  <bullet> LBond guarantors can provide more protection to the \n        taxpayer at less cost. If credit losses exceed the \n        level of capital allocated to a security--S. 1217 \n        proposes capital of at least 10 percent--in a \n        structured transaction, the Government will be \n        responsible for the additional losses. Bond guarantors, \n        in contrast, would be obligated to use their corporate \n        resources before tapping the reinsurance fund. The \n        regulator could also require higher capital for bond \n        guarantors in light of changing economic \n        circumstances--an approach supported by the recent \n        experience of loan level mortgage insurers--but it is \n        unclear how this could be done when individual \n        securities are credit enhanced through bond structures \n        that, once set in place, are not amenable to changes."
break,break,break,break
"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","    Please note that nothing that I have proposed would prevent \nbond guarantors from laying off credit risk in capital markets. \nAs a result, capital market investors could still be taking on \ncredit risk, and their capital would still be available to fund \nour housing finance system. While this practice may reintroduce \nsome of the problems I noted above--notably, accounting and \nsystemic risk issues--a system in which bond guarantors are \nprimarily responsible for first-loss credit risk would be more \nstable and better suited to meet the housing needs of America's \nfamilies.\n    However, if the bill ultimately includes both executions as \noptions, they must compete on a level playing field. As \ncurrently drafted, the bill encourages the pure capital markets \napproach, since that execution has little by way of regulatory \nrequirements and can more easily meet the capital thresholds \nthrough leverage. Instead, the bill should include \nsignificantly stronger regulatory mechanisms for both \nexecutions. Initial ``approval'' of an issuer or bond guarantor \ndoes not equal oversight, and in fact, may be counterproductive \nin that it may give a green light to subsequent actions that \nare unmonitored by the regulator. Additionally, if the bill \ndoes hard-code first-loss capital requirements, we believe the \n10 percent number would be appropriate for structured \ntransactions, while the appropriate level for bond guarantors \ncould safely be in the 4-5 percent range.\n                                ------                                "

And to the extent you have \nconcerns, if you have them, please make suggestions for how we \nmight alleviate those concerns?"
break,break,break,break
"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","A.1. The health and stability of the secondary market for \nmortgages depends upon availability of a range of sources of \ncapital to invest in the first-loss credit risk, meaning risk \nthat will be taken ahead of the risk exposure of the Government \non its guarantee. Broadly available investment capital will \npromote competition not only among institutions, but also among \nthe forms and structures of investment execution. This \ndiversity in turn will create an incentive for market \nparticipants to find the most efficient forms of execution.\n    That said, we believe that allowing for a broad range of \nforms of investment and retention of credit risk is best done \non the back-end of a guarantor model. That is, we believe that \nit would be better for legislators to create a system in which \nissuers of securities ultimately back-stopped by the Government \nwould be required to use bond guarantors to lay off the top-\nloss risk on their mortgage pools, allowing these bond \nguarantors to then further off-load that risk into the capital \nmarkets.\n    We hold this view for three reasons."
break,break,break,break
"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","  <bullet> LFirst, creating a model that allows issuers to go \n        directly to the capital markets as part of the bond \n        structuring process runs the risk of fracturing the \n        types of securities offered in the market to such a \n        degree that it would compromise the ``TBA'' (To-Be-\n        Announced) mortgage securities market. The TBA market \n        depends on a high degree of standardization and \n        homogeneity in issued securities. It would be unlikely \n        for such standardization to hold in a market in which \n        the credit risk of pools of loans were assumed and \n        distributed through complex structured transactions. \n        Moreover, participants in such transactions would \n        likely seek to apply their own credit risk preferences, \n        leading to more targeted pools of loans, with different \n        credit characteristics and differentiated pricing. Such \n        variability in the preferences of first-loss creditors \n        regarding the composition of mortgage pools would make \n        it more difficult to maintain fungibility of the pools \n        and, therefore, of the resulting securities. This would \n        materially inhibit forward trading through the TBA \n        market. This problem does not arise if the system \n        depends instead on issuers working with bond \n        guarantors, which would issue a more standardized form \n        of top-loss guarantee. These guarantors could then lay \n        off some of the risks that they assume from issuers to \n        the capital markets on the back end. In this way, the \n        bond guarantor function would work with the capital \n        markets in a transaction similar to reinsurance that \n        would enable homogeneity and fungibility (meaning, \n        ready trading markets) for the base mortgage \n        securities."
break,break,break,break
"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","  <bullet> LSecond, we are concerned that, in a time of \n        financial stress, the sources of capital in a pure and \n        direct capital-markets-dominated execution structure \n        could withdraw from the market quickly and \n        categorically, causing a crisis in liquidity. If \n        capital were to flee the market, the Government's offer \n        to provide a back-stop to pools of guaranteed loans \n        would be ineffective to ensure ongoing liquidity, \n        because there would not be market participants willing \n        to provide the first loss coverage on which the entire \n        system would depend. Again, this would not be as \n        significant a risk if there were a number of well-\n        capitalized bond guarantors in place to take first loss \n        credit risk."
break,break,break,break
"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","  <bullet> LThird, we are concerned that regulatory oversight \n        of the credit risk taken ahead of the Government \n        backstop, which will be an essential function of \n        regulatory supervision in any new system, would be \n        prohibitively difficult if a significant share of \n        first-loss risk were being structured, assumed and \n        distributed through myriad and complex securitization \n        structures and transactions. It would be far more \n        straightforward to conduct regulatory oversight of the \n        Government's risk exposure if first-loss positions were \n        being assumed by counterparties to the Government \n        structured as bond guarantor agencies, as such \n        oversight would entail traditional capital adequacy and \n        risk management supervisory functions similar to those \n        conducted today through Federal and State banking and \n        insurance regulatory bodies."
break,break,break,break
"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","    One final related point: We believe a bond guarantor \nstructure could and should enable issuers to work directly with \nthe top-loss bond guarantors to provide their own mortgage-pool \nlevel credit enhancement as part of the issuer-bond guarantor \ntransaction. This would enable issuers to participate in \noptimizing the pricing of the bond guarantee, driving \nincentives for low-cost and high credit-quality practices.\n    For these reasons, we would recommend allowing for a rich \nvariety of sources of capital taking on credit risk in the \nsystem, but in a position supporting bond guarantors. The bond \nguarantors would interface directly with issuers and be \ndirectly accountable to the Government supervisory process \nwhere the Government is in a position of reinsuring that risk. \nThis would preserve the critical forward trading function of \ntoday's TBA market while allowing intermediation of a wide \nvariety of capital sources.\n                                ------                                "

"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","Q.1. During the hearing the issue of capital markets execution, \nas opposed to bond guarantor ``entity'' execution, was \ndiscussed. Could you briefly discuss the advantages of allowing \nmultiple sources of capital--from both the equity and fixed-\nincome markets--take on credit risk? And to the extent you have \nconcerns, if you have them, please make suggestions for how we \nmight alleviate those concerns?\nThe TBA Market\nA.1. For markets to assume credit risk, a structure or \nstructures are needed to replace the depth and liquidity of the \ncurrent TBA or ``to be announced'' market. The TBA market is a \nforward-trading market that trades on limited information. The \nsecurities are guaranteed by the Government-Sponsored \nEnterprises (``GSEs'') and investors assume interest rate risk \nand prepayment risk. TBA investors do not assume credit risk; \nrather they assume only the risk that depending on the interest \nrate environment, they may receive their principal sooner or \nlater than anticipated (generally due to borrower prepayment on \nthe loans) or that the market value of the securities may \nfluctuate.\n    As discussed in the testimony of our Executive Director, \nthe TBA market is a crucial underpinning to the American \nmortgage market. Originators can hedge and fund their forward \norigination pipelines because they can ``lock in'' the rates \nand prices on the loans during the period between each trade \nand settlement date. The TBA market is a large, liquid market, \nwhere buyers and sellers are able to trade large blocks of \nsecurities in a short period of time. The liquidity of the TBA \nmarket creates efficiencies and cost savings for lenders that \nare passed on to borrowers in the form of lower rates and broad \navailability of mortgage products, and helps to maintain a \nnational mortgage market. The TBA market is the benchmark for \nall mortgage markets--it is the reference by which other \nmortgage markets and products are priced. Investors in a TBA \nsecurity presently have general guidelines that indicate to \nthem the ``four corners'' of what is contained in a particular \nsecurity, however at the time a trade is entered into the exact \ncomposition of the security is not revealed. As an example, an \ninvestor may have knowledge that their particular pool cannot \nhave more than 10 percent of the balance of a pool consisting \nof high balance loans.\n    SFIG is of the view that various structures may be able to \nfunction side by side with the TBA Market; however, because the \nTBA market requires a guaranty to function effectively, a \ncapital markets execution should not be seen as an alternative \nto a guarantor model, but rather as a supplement. A guarantor \nshould be able to raise capital to support its business through \nthe equity and debt markets as well as pair off some of its \nrisk to meet its capital requirements through risk transfers, \nswaps, credit-linked notes, etc. Raising these various forms of \ncapital and having a guarantor act as the channel through which \nthis risk is moderated acts as a countercyclical measure \nbecause it reduces the reliance on contemporaneous capital \nraises to fund mortgages.\nRecent GSE Risk Transfer Transactions\n    SFIG recognizes the importance of these transactions as a \nmonumental first step in transferring credit risk to the \nprivate market. Several of our members were participants in \nthese transactions and accordingly, we look forward to having \nthe private market work (with SFIG's support) with the GSEs to \nfurther build upon the recent credit risk transfer pilot \ntransactions. These transactions may prove to provide an \neffective mechanism to transfer certain credit risk as a \nfollow-on to TBA transactions, but they are not intended to be \na funding source for originations.\n    SFIG is of the view that while the transactions are an \nartful way to effectively de-risk the GSEs, due to certain \nstructural features, they cannot be seen as a capital markets \nexecution that can unilaterally replace traditional GSE \nfunctions. This is primarily because the recent transactions \nstill rely on the GSEs as the ultimate taker of catastrophic \nand systemic risk. In regards to the greater system of \nsecondary market mortgage funding, the GSEs still act as the \ninitial funding entity and the initial risk taker, thereby \nfacilitating reliable pricing to the consumer and allowing for \na functioning TBA market.\nAlternative Structures\n    A. Senior/Subordinate\n    For banks and mortgage companies that fund originations via \nthe private-label securitization market, (generally through a \nsenior/subordinate RMBS transaction), the following \nprerequisites are necessary before the proceeds on the loan and \nthe rate to the consumer can be determined:"

"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","  <bullet> Lthe level of subordination likely required for each \n        rating tranche for each particular pool of loans; and"
break,break,break,break
"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","  <bullet> Lthe likely price at which each tranche of these \n        securities will sell."
break,break,break,break
"","","heitkamp","Senator Heitkamp","    Gain or loss on these senior/subordinate structures is \ntypically determined through the subordination level that is \nrequired coupled with the pricing that the securities attain \nwhen sold. While hedging and rate-locking are possible in this \ntype of market, it is more expensive and less efficient than in \nthe current TBA market. Therefore, a lender is more exposed to \nmarket risk and uncertainty in a senior/subordinate structure \nthan in a TBA security in the current market.\n    The senior/subordinate structure also contains other \ninherent features that are irreconcilable with the TBA market. \nSpecifically, in a senior/subordinate structure the purchaser \nof the subordinated securities (which bear the majority of the \nrisk) requires much more information on each of the loans than \nis required or even possible for a TBA security. In fact, it is \nthe lack of certain information that allows diverse borrowers, \nproperty types, and loan attributes, which ultimately comprise \nthe housing finance market, to be converted into homogenous, \ncredit-neutral assets through the TBA market. Further, because \nthe TBA market is a forward market based on a hypothetical \npool, loan-level data is simply not available at the time of a \ntrade. Finally, because a TBA trade does not specify the \ncollateral to be delivered, an investor who purchases (or even \nexamines the loan-level data related to) a specific security \nwould be barred from participation in the TBA market for that \nentire coupon. This would mean that investors in credit would \nnot be able to hedge interest rate risk in the TBA market and \nwould severely impact investor interest in either of these \nmarkets.\n    A senior/subordinate structure may be used by the GSEs when \nloans are purchased by the GSEs in whole loan form for cash. \nThese loans can be subsequently pooled into a senior/\nsubordinate structure.\n    SFIG generally believes that senior/subordinate structures \nshould predominantly exist in the private-label securities \nmarket, which serves as a supplement, not a replacement, for \nthe TBA market, and also acts as a check and balance on \nguarantee fee pricing. Senior/subordinate structures could also \nbe incorporated into the new housing finance system on a \nlimited basis e.g., as described above with cash loans.\n    B. Credit-Linked Notes, Swaps, Derivatives, and a risk index\n    Credit-linked notes would most resemble the current GSE \nrisk sharing transactions and would also be compatible with the \nTBA market as a follow-on transaction; however, they require a \ncredit intermediary if they are to support a countercyclical \nmarket and a steady and reliable source of mortgage funding, as \nwould all the aforementioned forms of risk-sharing. An index \nwould be the most scalable and, if broad enough, would attract \nthe deepest capital base and require the least amount of \nsophistication to invest; however, it would require a credit \nintermediary/guarantor as well. These risk-sharing and risk-\ntransfer options, the GSE risk transfer transactions, along \nwith the use of swaps and other derivatives, are all artful \nways to fund a guarantor entity which could provide \ncountercyclical capital and act as a risk intermediary to allow \nfor steady and reliable pricing to originators and ultimately \nto the consumer.\nConclusion\n    It is SFIG's view, as indicated in our testimony, that some \nform of TBA market needs to exist to allow market participants \nto forward trade, which in turn allows borrowers to ``lock in'' \ninterest rates well in advance of closing and facilitates a \nnational mortgage market and the extension of mortgage credit \nin all credit cycles.\n    Any private capital resulting in credit risk transfer \nshould be scalable, compatible with the TBA market, and \nsustainable in both bull and bear markets. In our discussion \nabove, we highlight several structures, including the recent \nGSE transactions. These structures are an excellent way to \nintroduce private capital and supplement a guarantor or \ncentralized risk intermediary and thereby support a TBA market. \nThese structures should not be seen as a replacement for the \nTBA market or as a replacement for the need of a risk \nintermediary to ensure a steady source of funding for mortgage \ncredit in all market cycles. While we have belief that \npreserving the TBA market requires an institution to perform \nthe role of guarantor, we do not believe that the Government-\nSponsored Enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac need \nto be preserved in their current form to fulfill that role. We \nhope that you consider these views as you evaluate options to \nreform the housing finance system. We welcome the opportunity \nto discuss our views with you in person."
