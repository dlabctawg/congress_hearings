"fazio","Mr. Fazio","","","    Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I first want \nto congratulate you on initiating this series of hearings. Your \ninterest in this subject area and your knowledge about it are \nwell-known and well-respected.\n    I look forward to trying to put together the kind of \nproduct you indicated that you wanted to make the hallmark of \nthis committee. Since this is a leadership Committee, I think \nit will be also important that our leaderships be willing to \nwork together, if we are going to report out anything that \ncould resemble a bipartisan or consensus approach to campaign \nfinance reform.\n    I want to welcome the Speaker and later on our leader, Dick \nGephardt, will join us as well. I think we value your marquee \ncontribution to this effort today. I think it does bring \nattention to the fact that we are, once again, about to delve \ninto one of the most controversial and difficult areas that we \nlegislate in. We have 435 plus experts on the subject, all of \nwhom have run successful for office, at least once.\n    The need for campaign reform is increasingly obvious, with \nevery passing election. The cost of communicating with our \nconstituents, the citizens who elect us, is growing enormously. \nAll of us struggle with the amount of time which we are \nrequired to devote to fund-raising alone. It probably is the \ngreatest cost to our modern campaign ritual. But let me say \nthat I think the biggest problem we face is the developing, \nperhaps it is already here, total crisis and confidence that \nhas developed over not only the electoral process but also over \nthe process of governing which flows right out of it. We have \nfar too little trust of the public at the moment, and I think \nour efforts here today are on the part of all of us designed to \nsee if we can do something to recover that."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    But despite the general consensus that reforms are needed, \nthe task of coming up with something that suffices is \nenormously difficult. Americans react to the way of financing \ncampaigns in many different ways, but I think two are the most \nobvious and at the same time contradictory. On the one hand, \npeople believe that campaign money buys elections that, in \neffect, public officials are bought in the electoral process. \nWe hear a lot of rhetoric about special interests and PACs and \nfat cats and all the rest. At the same time, in most election \nyears, 20 million Americans choose willingly to contribute to \ncampaigns. They do so in many cases with strong feelings of \nvirtue, because they, as groups and individuals, think that the \nmoney they contribute really does go to the furtherance, not \nonly of what is in their interest but their ideals and their \ngoals for the country. So at the same time that we bash \npoliticians and dump on the system of electing them, we find \nmany, many people willingly participating in them.\n    So it is not clear today that this issue, which has grown \nincreasingly difficult to deal with, can be resolved in terms \nof ways that really improve the system. We are all much better \nat describing the problem than coming up with a consensus, an \nalternative to the current system.\n    So let me state from the outset that despite the very \nnegative coverage that the media gives our system, and it is \nalmost unanimously critical from differing perspectives on \noccasion, this is, as the Chairman has already said, the most \ndiscloseable, most accountable system of any government at \nanytime in history.\n    Our constituents have available to them our official \npersonal finances, our office accounts, our campaign finances. \nThere is nothing about us or the political system we \nparticipate in that isn't available. And despite the claims of \nsome so-called reformers, this body has not failed to take up \nthe issue of campaign reform. In fact, as the Chairman has \nindicated, we are still operating with a much amended by the \nCourt law that is 20 years old but we have attempted on many \noccasions to delve into this area. Three, as a matter of fact, \ntimes in the last Congresses we have passed reform bills. They \nhaven't become law. I am sure they were imperfect in many ways \nand I know there were partisan differences over them. But they \nwere the product of tremendous effort, some attempts to reach \nconsensus and they were all, I think, a step in the right \ndirection, even if they did not accomplish their ultimate \npurpose, a truly bipartisan breakthrough.\n    So, Mr. Chairman, I think this series of hearings is the \nway we really ought to once again review the bidding on how to \ngo about financing and conducting Federal elections. Hopefully, \nit will provide a real foundation for all of us to build the \nkind of legislation that I think would once again help restore \nsome confidence in our representational form of government.\n     Mr. Chairman, there are a lot of things that need to be \nsaid about the subject of today's hearing, PACs and related \nissues. I hope we will have a chance, in dialoguing with our \ncolleagues, to make some of those points. I think it is fair to \nsay that many of the ideas that we will hear today have been \naround the track before. This is not an area where there has \nbeen a lot of new and creative thinking. Perhaps it is too much \nto ask of the mere mor"

"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","tals on this committee but perhaps we can break through and fully \nunderstand the implications of not only what we have done in \nthe past but some of the panaceas we will have offered today \nabout fixing the present.\n     I hope people will think big thoughts and come up with \nsome new concepts, because in the past, we have been victimized \nby Murphy's Law more often than not. In fact, all of the \nefforts to bring about the disclosure, the accountability that \nthe PAC system personifies were done in the name of reform. \nThis was a way of bringing middle management, white collar \nworkers into the political process, equivalent to what the \norganized labor movement had brought about.\n     When former Representative Clark MacGregor, Republican of \nMinnesota, led the charge to bring PACs into being, it was all \nabout getting away from the Watergate problems of the 1970s, \nthe under the table, the soft money and all of the large \ncontributions that appalled the public. So when we look to \nfixing the problem, let's remember, we fixed it so many times \nbefore that we now have an even bigger one. Let's begin also by \nassuming that if we don't fully fund the FEC, whatever we put \nin place will not be adequately monitored and enforced.\n     So, Mr. Chairman, we bite off a lot today, but I think it \nis time, and I think this committee has the capability to put \ntogether a product that might make us all proud.\n    Thank you.\n     The Chairman. Thank you."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","<DOC>\n   STATEMENT OF HON."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Speaker Gingrich. Well, let me thank both of you for what I \nthink is exactly the right tone in starting these hearings, \nwhich I think could be of historic importance. I came to the \nCongress with Chairman Thomas. We both came to serve on this \ncommittee, and I served prior to becoming Speaker on this \ncommittee with a great sense of contribution on a bipartisan \nbasis and working with my colleagues on both sides, both in \nrunning the House but also in looking at election reform.\n     I want to confess that frankly one of the areas--and I \nthink what Mr. Fazio said is absolutely the hallmark of how we \nshould be approaching this. In the 1970s we adopted a whole \nseries of things we thought would work. We are now told that in \nmany ways the reforms are the problems.\n     We also--and I will give you an example in my personal \nexperience. I once co-authored--or authored a preface to a book \ncalled ``A Nation of Associations,'' in which I praised the \npolitical action committee system because in the late '70s and \nearly '80s, it seemed like the logical place to have people \nvoluntarily organizing their effort in a manner you could trace \nand understand, and it fit what we thought in the late '70s \nwere the problems of the Watergate period.\n     Then I read Brooks Jackson's marvelous work on ``Honest \nGraft,'' which showed how brilliantly our former colleague, Mr. \nCoelho, came to dominate the PACs in Washington and how they \nbecame an instrument of Washington. And I would say to all of \nyou with a certain cheerfulness and a wry sense of amusement \nthat now that we are the majority, it turns out that everything \nMr. Coelho did works; and that, in fact, to a discouraging \ndegree, the political action system has become an arm of the \nWashington lobbyists, and in fact simply follows power without \nideology; and is, in fact, not an appropriate system for the \nexpression of citizen concern, although I think on a \nconstitutional basis it is probably not something we should \nban, but rather something we should rethink from the ground up.\n     But the point that Mr. Fazio made is where I want to \nstart, that all too often when we have someone who has their \nsingle magic solution which will cure everything because they \ndon't have any historic understanding of it, they haven't been \nthrough it, they haven't thought about it over a long period of \ntime, and they may be asking the wrong questions.\n     I believe we need a very profound overhaul of our \npolitical system. I think we have to look at lobbying, at \ncampaigns, at parties, at the behavior of incumbents, of the \nnature of Washington, what is happening as we shift into an \ninformation age. I think candidly there are grave threats to \nthe survival of American freedom and self-government as we know \nit.\n     But the threats aren't necessarily those that Common Cause \ntargets. The rise of media oligarchies, including Mr. Rupert \nMurdoch--who many of you have attacked me about--but all the "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","media oligarchies, including my hometown favorite Ted Turner, whose \nBraves just did a wonderful job, but who now is part of a huge \nsystem at Time Warner--including the rise of Disney/ABC.\n     We have to look at the rise of foreign money. When Hong \nKong closes down, there will be a whole wave of new \nbillionaires who arrive in America. What will their power do? \nRome collapsed in part because it couldn't cope with the money \nthat came out of Asia as the Roman Empire expanded.\n    And what do we do in a world market where people can \ntransfer billions of dollars into this country from anywhere on \nthe planet, whether it is cocaine dealers in Colombia or it is \nRussian Mafia or it is legitimate honest Chinese businessmen \nafraid of what may happen to Hong Kong? What do we do about the \nrise of millionaires and billionaires?\n    I have to say with great candor, I think it is very \ndangerous for this country to have the dramatic increase in \npurchasing offices, whether it is Mr. Perot's effort to \npurchase the presidency or it is good friends of ours who want \nto purchase Senate seats or it is honest reasonable Members who \nwant to purchase House seats. And the fact is, that is in part \na reaction to the collapse of the parties and to the fact that \nwe have all too many--the incumbents have too much power and \nonly millionaires are competitive.\n     We also have to look at the decay of political parties, \nwhich I will return to. But I think this is the core place \nwhere Common Cause is just plain wrong. To focus on election \ncampaign reform, without putting it in a political party \nsystemic approach, is a profound mistake. And I will come back \nto that.\n     I also think we have to recognize that all of the growth \nof our society, 260 million people, a worldwide system of \ncommerce and military power, an information age explosion of \ndata, means that the average citizen today feels more alienated \nand more isolated, and there frankly I found most sobering \nreading Peter Green's ``From Alexander to Actium'' and his \ndescription, his vivid description of the collapse of civic \nlife in Greece and its parallel in Greek drama, as it went from \nserious plays about serious public policy to soap operas and \nlight comedies, because Greek citizens just psychologically \nwithdrew from the process of self-government because it became \ntoo hard.\n     Senator Dole and I have discussed and will propose a \ncommission. This is my response which I promised after New \nHampshire. I believe we should have a commission on power and \npolitical reform on the information age, not narrowly on \ncampaigns. I believe that commission should have eight members \nfrom each side, eight recommended by Senator Dole and myself, \neight recommended by the President, Mr. Gephardt and Mr. \nDaschle.\n     I believe that commission should meet regularly and have \nadequate funding. I think it should have exhaustive hearings \nand I think it should report by May 1st. I think the report \nshould be in two parts. On any item in which two-thirds of the \ncommissioners agree, I believe they should come to the Floor of \nthe House and Senate, much like the Base Closing Commission.\n     On any item which gets a simple majority, I believe it \nshould come up as a recommendation which we would have an \nobligation to hold hearings on and consider in a second bill. I \nwould like us "

"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","to spend the summer of next year restoring honest self-government and \nhave passed a bill before the end of the session so that we \ncould go into the fall campaign knowing that we have done our \njob.\n     Now, let me outline a few things.\n     In parallel to the commission, which I hope the President \nwill accept and sign and I hope we can frankly offer on a \nbipartisan basis and pass on a bipartisan basis, my hope is \nthat this committee will hold a series of hearings of historic \nimportance over the course of the next four or five months. And \nI want to outline what I think you should look at.\n     Let me start by citing David Broder talking about our \ncurrent political situation. And this is a direct quote from \nBroder."

"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    The governmental system is not working because the \npolitical parties are not working. The parties have been \nweakened by their failure to adapt to some of the social and \ntechnological changes taking place in America, but even more, \nthey are suffering from simple neglect, neglect by presidents \nand public officials but particularly neglect by the voters."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","     He goes on to say,"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    What we have is a society in which discontent, disbelief, \ncynicism and political inertia characterize the public mood; a \ncountry whose economy suffers from severe dislocations, whose \ncurrency is endangered, where increasing numbers of people and \neven giant enterprises live on the public dole, a country whose \ntwo races continue to withdraw from each other in growing \nphysical and social isolation, a country whose major public \ninstitutions command steadily less allegiance from its \ncitizens; whose education, transportation, law enforcement, \nhealth and sanitation systems fall short of filling their \nfunctions * * * and a country still far from reconciling its \ninternational responsibilities with its unmet domestic needs. \nWe are in trouble, and now, unlike a decade ago, the people \nknow it. The question is: Can we still save ourselves from \ndeadlock without sacrificing our democracy?"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","     Eloquent words, written in 1971 in a book called ``The \nParty is Over,'' which is, I think, a superb introduction to \nthe decay of the American political party, which I think is one \nof the keys to re-establishing where we are going.\n     The reason I say that is that power has to be mediated. \nSomebody has to be able to bring together the long-term \nresponsibilities of where we are going with the immediate \nrequirement of running for office. Somebody has to say to \naverage citizens of average wealth, with an average amount of \ntime: Here is a rational way to organize your involvement as a \ncitizen. And that structure has been for 200 years the \npolitical parties, first invented by Jefferson and Madison and \nBurr in the origin of the longest-lived and greatest of our \nparties, the Democratic Party, which is the longest existing \npolitical organization in the world.\n    Because the parties have collapsed, the opportunity for \nmiddle class people to rise has gone down. When I entered the \nHouse in 1979, 24 of my fellow Members were millionaires. That \nnumber today is 61, every seventh Member of the House. That is \nprofoundly disturbing. The Senate is far more dominated by \nmillionaires.\n     And we see around the country, on a bipartisan basis, \nmillionaires who buy office, and that's what it is. The writing \nof a large enough check to hire the modern version of political \nbosses, hired hacks who go from state to state often using \nliterally the same ad, simply redesigning it for the newest \nshot, almost always negative, almost always irresponsible, and \noften totally dishonest, on a bipar"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","tisan basis. And we produced a campaign system none of us can be proud \nof and which serves the country ill.\n     One minor suggestion I am going to suggest to you, and I \nhave a number of suggestions as I go through this, but one for \nyou to consider is that, one, we look at the degree to which \nincumbent protection leads to the rise of millionaires in \npublic office.\n     Two, we look at the degree to which the decline of parties \ninhibits the rise of people of average means; and three, we \nconsider seriously dropping all campaign contribution limits to \na candidate whose opponent spends in excess of $100,000 of \ntheir own money, thereby at least evening out the field so that \nboth candidates have equal resources.\n     Let me also state----\n     The Chairman. Would the gentleman yield for just a moment?\n     Speaker Gingrich. Yes, I would be glad to.\n     The Chairman. I will announce to the Members that the vote \nis on the journal. The Chairman and the Ranking Member will \npurposely not cast our votes on the journal so that the \ncommittee hearing can proceed. Any Members who wish to go cast \ntheir votes may do so.\n     Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\n     Speaker Gingrich. When I say, as I did a while ago, I \nthink it is important to understand that most modern campaign \ncritique comes from the left, starting with the distrust of the \nprivate sector, a dislike of private resources, an assumption \nthat money from the state is good, that money from individual \ncitizens is bad, and a belief that it is the campaigns that \nmatter, not the larger system of the parties.\n     One of the results has been federally funded campaigning, \nwhich had exactly the result conservative theorists would have \nsuggested, that is, if you make money available people will \nfind a way to get there.\n     My favorite example is Lenora Fulani. Lenora Fulani--\nbecause what happens is you have sort of a nut class of \npolitics. Lenora Fulani has received $3.5 million from the \ntaxpayers in the 1984, 1988 and 1992 campaigns because she has \nfound an industry. Her industry is to get enough people to \nsupport her to be eligible for tax-paid funds so she can then \nearn a living getting tax-paid funds. It is a terrific racket.\n     Lyndon LaRouche received matching funds, according to a \nGeorge Will column of June 4th, 1995, even while he was in \njail. So what happens is when you set up a socialist model of \ngovernment-paid campaigning, people learn how to get on the \ndole. The dole this time is not welfare. This is political \nwelfare. So I would say that this is part of why I think Common \nCause has been at a dead end, frankly.\n     What we need to look at is that candidates and parties \nneed money to introduce themselves to the public and yet today \nwe have an inappropriate system of finding the money.\n     Frank Sorauf, a professor at the University of Minnesota, \nwrote a very interesting paper in 1987 in which he compared the \nmass media of the United States today as a version of the \nprogressive political outlook which dominated American society \nfrom the 1890s to the 1920s. The progressives saw the American \npublic as being "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","decent people, yet prey for rapacious special interests intent on \nbuying elections and corrupting the political process.\n     This is what Professor Sorauf wrote in the Political \nScience Quarterly of spring of 1987."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","grandchildren of the Progressive muckrakers. * * * Very few \naspects of the American political process reinforce the \nProgressive world view as effectively as the American way of \ncampaign finance. Its cash is an easy measure of influence and \nits PACs are perfect embodiments of the special, vested, or \nselfish interests.\n    It is indeed usual for newspapers to define PACs as, \n``special interest groups,''. If one makes the simple \nassumption that public officials defer to their campaign \ncontributors more easily than they do to their party, their own \nvalues or their own voting constituency, one has the perfect \nscenario for the triumph of the wealthy special interests over \nthe will of electoral majorities and the general or public \ninterest."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    That summarizes the guilty-until-proven-innocent approach \nthat candidates are confronted with in today's highly charged \natmosphere. Sorauf illustrates how this inherent bias affects \ncampaign finance coverage, often resulting in sloppy and \ninaccurate stories.\n    That is, ABC News owned by Disney is not a special \ninterest. So a multimillionaire broadcaster on ABC News being \ngiven free access to the American people doesn't represent \npolitical power. On the other hand, a thousand dollars written \nby the broadcaster's spouse is political power. It is simply a \nnonsensical socialist analysis based on hatred of the free \nenterprise system, and I think is fundamentally false.\n    The three networks spent $1.1 billion on news in one year, \nwith profits of nearly $200 million. By comparison, the total \nspent in the 1992 presidential campaign is $550 million on all \nsides. The Disney/ABC merger by itself is worth $19 billion.\n    So when we talk about money and politics, let's put it \ncontextually where it is. Campaign spending rose from $109,000 \nper congressional race during 1978, the first time I won, to \n$440,000 last year. That represents about $3 per eligible \nvoter. It is less than $1 per citizen in the district. And one \nof the greatest myths of modern politics is that campaigns are \ntoo expensive. The political process, in fact, is underfunded; \nit is not overfunded, the political process. But I would \nemphasize far more the money in the political system--I mean in \nthe parties.\n    Let me also say, I think we have to look at political \nfreedom against the state. I was told this summer by a \ncorporate CEO for a Fortune 100 company, and my guess is that \nMr. Fazio has had similar conversations as a leader of his \nparty, that he could not be a co-sponsor of a congressional \ncampaign committee fundraiser because he has to do business \nwith Ron Brown. This is not an attack on Ron Brown. It is a \nstatement of fact.\n    I suspect there are occasions, now that we are the \nmajority, the old people who used to be your friends tell you \nthey can't give you money. But my point is to say this: It is \nnot--the state has power. It is good on the one hand to list \neverybody's contributions. On the other hand, we ought to \nunderstand, in the long run that means to dissent is to put \nyourself at risk.\n    And so I think, again, you have got to come back and ask \nsome very fundamental questions about what should the rights of \nthe citizen be, what is their ability to protect themselves, \nand in what way if you have an aggressive state does it punish \nor coerce those "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","who dissent, and how do we protect the rights of individual freedom? \nHow do we make sure that citizens can run?\n    Don't think of candidates as much-maligned politicians. \nThink of candidates as potential elected citizens. Just use the \nterm ``elected citizen'' for a little bit. See how different it \nsounds and how different the implication is. And ask yourself, \nwhat does it cost a citizen who wishes to seek election to \nmarket one's self, given the scale of the modern media?\n    Let me give you an example I live with. The Cox sisters own \nthe largest television station in my area, the largest radio \nstation in my area, and the only major daily newspaper in the \nstate of Georgia. They have all three. Now, they don't give any \ncontributions to my opponent, but I would guess that over half \nthe money I raise is spent offsetting the weight of their \nnewspaper. I think any Republican from Iowa would tell you that \nthe Des Moines Register so dominates the politics of their \nstate that they have to spend a third to half of their campaign \noffsetting the Des Moines Register.\n    Now, it is perfectly natural for the news media to want \ncampaign spending limits. That means more power for editorial \nwriters, more power for columnists, more power for reporters, \nbut it means less ability for citizens outside that newspaper's \nbiases in order to answer and respond to the publication.\n    Let's also be honest about what it costs to communicate in \nAmerica. Three antacids, Pepcid AC, Tagamet and Zantac spend \n$300 million a year. So on the concept of what should you put \nin your stomach if you need an antacid, we spend $300 million a \nyear. Microsoft '95's national launch cost over $250 million. \nTiger Electronics, the third largest toy manufacturer, during \nthe Christmas season, spends $30 million.\n    By contrast, in 1992, a major political party spent $110 \nmillion. That is, the Democrats or the Republicans nationally \nin the general election of '92 spent one third what we spend on \nantacid. Ross Perot personally--or spent $68.3 million, I don't \nknow how much of that was personal--but he spent $68.3 million.\n    Congressional spending for all the congressional seats was \n$600 million. That's 435 House seats and 33 Senate seats, was \nthe equivalent of two antacid campaigns, all of them. Every \nidea, balance the budget, gay rights, abortion, national \ndefense, all of them was the equivalent of two antacid campaign \nads, and yet we are told politics is too expensive.\n    We cheat our system. We don't communicate rationally. We \ndon't have enough information. People don't get enough data. \nThere is a report--there is a suggestion in Kentucky that \nturnout will be down because the campaign limit is so low that \npeople literally aren't getting the message there is an \nelection underway. And I would commend to the committee that \nyou look at the effect of state campaign limits and how much \ncitizens actually know about the campaigns.\n    I also want to suggest that the current campaign law has \nsome profound weaknesses, and that the Federal Election \nCommission in its current form is, frankly, profoundly \ndestructive. The current Federal regulatory system makes it \nharder for an average citizen to get involved in politics \nbecause you have to hire a lawyer and you have to hire an \naccountant to meet Federal regulations."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    The current system also, I believe, encourages every \npresidential candidate to cheat. I mean, if you were to hold a \nhearing and ask in any of the last three campaigns, how many \ncampaigns arrived in Omaha to rent the car--I mean, just think \nabout it. The Iowa primary, the Iowa caucus, because of the \nstate level limits, we basically say to every presidential \ncampaign, in the name of honest politics, why don't you rig \nyour expenditures if you are going to be competitive. So you \nbreak the spirit of the law, although technically being legal. \nAnd there is something profoundly wrong with reforms that \nencourage cheating.\n    In addition, the laws have stagnated. A thousand dollars in \n1974, the limit for primary and general election campaign \ncontributions per individual, in constant dollars, is worth \n$356. That is, if we were to allow citizens today to contribute \na thousand dollars in 1974 money, the limit would be $2,808. \nAnd one of the things I want to recommend to this committee is \nthat you reverse the limits, give individuals a $5,000 limit, \ngive PACs a $1,000 limit and then index both.\n    I also want to suggest you create an entirely separate \nlimit for giving to parties, any party. That would include \nindependent and third parties, but that giving to a party \nshould be a separate limit from giving to candidates, because I \nthink we consciously want to strengthen the parties.\n    I am also willing--and this may surprise some of you since \nI am now the Speaker--I am also willing to have us establish a \nprinciple that the parties should be able to offset the \nincumbent's office expenses at least up to some limit. 40 \npercent, 50 percent, but in some way. It is profoundly unfair \nfor me to have all the advantages of office and go back home to \ntake on a challenger who starts out with zero. I don't think it \nought to be 100 percent, because as Barney Frank once pointed \nout, there are a lot of things we have to do that don't \nnecessarily help us.\n    But there should be some party offset that allows the \nopposition party to spend a larger amount as a party than the \nincumbent party in order to have a fair campaign. I'm willing \nto do that even though it clearly is to the Republicans' \ndisadvantage.\n    I also want to recommend we relook at revisiting the \nindividual tax credit which we had in the '70s, and which I \nthink was a step in the right direction to encourage individual \ncontributions at the small dollar level.\n    But there is a deeper part of this, and this is why I \nemphasize not just looking at campaigns. Power flows somewhere. \nYou never kill power. You just distort it. If you hide it, if \nyou force it underground, the tighter the limits on the \ncampaigns, the more independent expenditures there will be. The \ntighter the limits on the parties, the more money will grow up \nunder 501(c)(4)s and a variety of grotesque institutions.\n    One of the challenges I would like to make to this \ncommittee is, early next year when we have time to truly gather \nthe information, take a look at this fall on both sides, who \nraised money, who spent money. I mean, our side believes, for \nexample, that at least $20 million is being spent by the unions \nin an ad campaign naming by name members of the House. Now, if \nwe have campaign limits, would that go under the limit or would \nthat be outside the limit? "

"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    I suspect you all believe that we have friends who are \nputting together ad campaigns designed to strengthen our \nposition, but we need to put in context the totality of what \nhappens in American politics and not simply look at it in a \nnarrow, isolated way.\n    And let me say to you: I believe the rise of irresponsible \nmoney, outside the parties and outside the campaigns, is a much \ngreater threat to America than the monies spent in the \ncampaigns.\n    And, again, without being too academic, I would encourage \nyou to at least have your staff talk with experts around the \ncountry about what happened in Greece, in Rome and the period \nfrom the English Civil War up through our Constitution, and to \nlook at the works of Jefferson and Madison, Lincoln, Theodore \nRoosevelt, Henry Cabot Lodge, and Wilson, because this is not a \nnew problem. This problem of how do you organize power so \npeople can be free has happened over a very long period of \ntime.\n    Let me just say, in closing, and I appreciate your allowing \nme to offer you this broad overview, I really am--and I have \nhad a fair amount of experience. I first got active in politics \nin the late 1950's when I was in high school. I was a volunteer \nfor the Nixon-Lodge campaign in 1960, Muscogee County, Georgia. \nI have run a congressional campaign. I have been a state leader \nof my party. I was a--worked on presidential campaigns. I ran \nfor office, obviously, and I lost twice and I have won office a \nnumber of times.\n    I am deeply troubled by what I think are the dangers to \nAmerican self-government. I'm frankly not nearly as troubled by \nthe Common Cause news media versions of those problems, but I \ndo think in the next 20 or 25 years, if we are not careful, we \nwill have so alienated our citizens, we will have so lost \ntouch, the individual candidates will be either rich people or \npeople who are supported by independent expenditures on a \ngrotesque scale.\n    And I think we need a thorough review of the American \npolitical system, and then frankly we need a system's approach. \nWe need a set of principles to be articulated by this \ncommittee. How should government work in the 21st century? How \nshould power work in the information age? What is the role of \nthe political parties? And within that framework, how shall we \nredefine incumbents, lobbyists, candidates, volunteers?\n    And I can pledge to you that on the part of my office, we \nwill cooperate on a bipartisan basis, because if we do it \nright--and we have been through several rounds that have \nfailed. So I think we have some experience here. Everybody who \nis senior on this committee has been through several \nexperiences that failed, beginning I think in 1980 when we were \nfreshman. We have a chance now, I think, if we are honest about \nit, to produce by early next year a much deeper understanding \nof what we need to do and in a genuine bipartisan way to move \nforward.\n    And I would also frankly be interested in the committee's \nreaction to the concept of having some kind of bipartisan \ncommission, because I suspect this is the committee that any \nbill that we would introduce with the President's support would \nbe sent to.\n    So thank you for letting me testify.\n    The Chairman.

"pastor","Mr. Pastor","pastor","Mr. Pastor","    You talked about the limitations that we have \ntoday are not realistic because of inflation, et cetera. There \nis some thought in this country, that possibly the issue of \nlimitations is--should not be discussed, but rather it is the \ndisclosure that is more important. And people feel that in \ntoday's technology, through E-mail and faxes and all of that, \nthat you can almost report immediately and should be required \nto report immediately any donation that you receive.\n    My question is, basically, would you be willing to consider \ntaking the further step and saying there should be no \nlimitations but disclosure should be immediate and you could--\n--\n    Speaker Gingrich. Well, I would--I am not sure I would go \nto no limitation, although I would certainly entertain that. I \ndon't think the limitations in the long run are particularly \nhelpful because what happens is people who really want to be \ninvolved find other ways to spend money and it is less easy to \ndiscover and less easy to be directly involved with.\n    The only thing I would suggest--I have no problem because I \nthink you could technically literally have every night filing, \nbut I think we ought to be honest about it. Again, it is one of \nthe things that our friends in the news industry never cover \naccurately and that Common Cause doesn't understand at all.\n    You have campaign volunteers. You receive checks during the \nday. You may receive 200 or 300 if you are having a big event. \nAn honest, sincere person enters all the data but makes 3 \nmistakes out of 1,500 items being entered. When that--if that \nis filed that night, and I have had this experience, if that is \nfiled that night, is that now legally binding? Or is that, in \nfact, an initial filing subject to review within 30 days?\n    I would just say to my friend we need to think it through. \nI have no problem, frankly, having much more immediate filing, \nparticularly in the last month before an election, when you \ncould have a sudden infusion of cash. I would just commend you \nto think it through and to have hearings and to not criminalize \nhonest behavior by sincere people who may miss--you know, may \nenter them wrong."

"","","pastor","Mr. Pastor","    The FEC's adversarial attitude is exactly wrong and what it \ndoes is it creates a very harsh environment in which everybody \ndeals with the FEC as though they were the IRS of politics. \nThat is exactly the wrong attitude to have if you have to have \ncitizens and amateurs involved because they care about their \ncountry.\n    Let me say one other thing about the limits. In 1974, the \naverage House campaign spent $109,000. In 1994, the average \nHouse campaign spent $440,000. In 1974, it cost $32,000 to buy \na 30-second ad on a national network. In 1995, it cost between \n$150,000 and $178,000 to buy the same ad. So network television \nadvertising went up at a rate faster than politics.\n    Again, I am just trying to make the point here that we \nought to put in context the limits that were set in the 1970s \nand ask ourselves realistically: Do we truly want to starve the \nAmerican people of information?"

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your presentation. I think that \nit is so important to realize that this is a--such a larger \nissue than is usually thought of.\n    I am an American citizen of the American middle class, and \nI could not participate in the political process, and it was so \nsuccinctly brought to light and I was thinking about it when \nyou were talking, if I depended--if campaign spending in my \ncampaigns were more than simply a peripheral way for me at \nelection time to communicate my message. In my community we are \nvery fortunate that there are some fair and objective people \nthat happen to own a small newspaper or a radio station or that \nhappen to manage a television station and permit the message to \nbe communicated to the people. If I had to depend on the Knight \nRidder newspaper in my community to cover what we are doing up \nhere, I really don't think that come campaign time it would be \npossible to counter, not only the editorials but the slants on \na continuous basis of the articles that the newspaper produces \nthroughout the two years.\n    So I want to commend you for pointing out that what we are \ndealing with are not trees here but really a major forest and \nthat also we need to look at the historical context.\n    I think it is very important that you brought out that one \nof the great--one of the great problems that we are facing is \nthe ability for people with a tremendous amount of money to \npurchase--to purchase seats in Congress, and one thing, Mr. \nChairman, that I think that we really have to focus in on in \nthese hearings, as we look at these issues brought before us, \nsuch as limiting further campaign contributions, is precisely \nthe issue of the effect of such a limit when one's opponent has \nno limits. I know that the Supreme Court has held that that is \na freedom of speech issue.\n    So, Mr. Speaker, let me commend you not only for bringing \nforth the big picture but for your courage and for, I think, \nsetting a framework here that will be very, very helpful, as we \nproceed in these months in further hearings.\n    The Chairman. Does the gentleman from Maryland wish to \ninquire?"
break,break,break,break,break
"hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","pastor","Mr. Pastor","    I don't wish to inquire, Mr. Chairman. I want to \ncommend the Speaker. I think his comments were very useful, \nvery helpful.\n    I think that the American public, would, be surprised in \nthe commonality of perspectives, perhaps not the answers but \nthe commonality of perspectives that exist among those on both \nsides from various different ideologies who have been in this \ncampaign finance system for a long period of time.\n    I became active in the Kennedy campaign; you, in the Nixon \ncampaign. We were on opposite sides. I then was elected to the \nState senate in 1966. I was interested in your quote of the \nBroder book, because in my opinion the decline of parties, in \nyour favorite phrase, has, in fact, had a profound impact on \nthe practice of politics and the financing of politics and the \ndisintegration of focus of politics and a sense in the American \npublic that where divided; where we have gridlock; that we \ncannot act.\n    I also think that you reiterated the comments made by so \nmany; that relatively speaking, the communication of political \nthought is relatively underfunded in America, not overfunded. \nWhether it is parties clearly or candidates. And also that \nsince 1974, the value of the limits provided, and you and I may \nhave a disagreement as to whether collective groups ought to be \nable to contribute more heavily than individually wealthy \npeople. Obviously, there are few people in the country who can \ncontribute $5,000 to you, to me, or to others. That is not true \nof the collective. So we may disagree on that.\n    But relatively speaking, you mentioned 350 some odd dollars \nas the contribution that now the thousand dollar limit \nreflects. It is about $1,200 that the $5,000 reflects. So that \nby operation of time and inflation, we have substantially \nreduced the value of the contributions to be made either by \ncollective groups known as PACs or by individuals.\n    But I think the comments that you made, I think on our side \nyou probably have an awful lot of agreement, and I think, in \nfact, if we can pursue this in a bipartisan fashion, as we have \ndone some other things, dealing with millionaires and salaries \nand things that are very controversial, but are made less so if \nin a partisan context, the American public understands that we \ncan very substantially disagree on the policies that we want to \npursue but not necessarily disagree substantially on the \ncontext in which those policies ought to be put forward to the \nAmerican public, decided and resolved. And so I think it was a \nuseful presentation.\n    I thank you for it.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Does the gentlewoman from Washington wish to \nmake a comment?\n    Ms. Dunn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure to hear you speak. I \nthink you often elevate our perspective and broaden our \nperspective. In this case, I realize now more than ever that we \nhave a big chore to do as we look at the broad picture of \nfinance reform. I think we have an historic opportunity if we \ngo about reform in the way that you suggest."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    I also like the combination of the time line that you have \nlaid out, so that by the end of this Congress we can come up \nwith a set of reforms that really will solve some of the huge \nproblems into which we have run. So I am going to be working \ntoward this end.\n    I would like to ask you one question, because it has been \nsomething of a problem for the Congress in the past. How do you \nenvision working with the Senate so that we can put together a \nreally good, solid bill on campaign finance reform and prepare \nit to go to the President?\n    Speaker Gingrich. I think, first of all, as I said a little \nwhile ago, Senator Dole and I have discussed the idea of \ncreating a commission which I think is an important first step. \nIf we can get bicameral bipartisan support for getting that up \nand running, I would hope that the Senate would consider a set \nof parallel hearings to what you are going to be doing because \nI think you can create a new context for reform. And if the \nSenate could agree in their appropriate committee to hold \nsimilar hearings at some point, I would like to suggest you \nactually have some meetings that are joint.\n    As you know on the budget, for example, we have had \nsubstantial success in working in a bicameral way. We have a \nmeeting every morning at 9:00 a.m., that is, a joint House-\nSenate leadership meeting. I think that this--recognizing the \ncomplexity of our own constitutional system that there is \nactually an advantage to occasionally reaching beyond--the \nbuilding doesn't have to be--as somebody said, it is really \nfurther from the House to the Senate than you think because you \ngo around the world to come in the other side of the building \nto get there, and our cultures are sometimes that different. \nThey don't have to be.\n    So I would hope--and I think Senator Dole is committed to \nworking on a campaign reform approach that really is bicameral \nand bipartisan. And as I said, I hope this will--the President \nfeels this meets the conditions we set back in New Hampshire in \nthe spring and that he will agree to support and to sign in \ncreating a bipartisan commission to look at the totality of \npolitical reform.\n    Ms. Dunn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. The gentleman from California."
"fazio","Mr. Fazio","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    I wanted to simply say as relates to the commission that we \ndo need to talk about this. I think the idea that you present \nis a provocative one, and I think it does require that we take \na larger perspective than simply campaign finance reform, \nbecause that is a part of a total breakdown in the American \npolitical system.\n    I wanted to simply get more information from you on two \nthings: One, I think most of us realize that we have \ncontributed greatly with the money we raise and spend in \ncampaigns toward the negative attitude that people have about \nus, the process, and governing itself. Would you be willing to \nenter into the thicket, it is a first amendment problem, of \ntrying to in some way regulate what television ads are run so \nthat we avoid the relentless negative which turns off everyone \neven while it may drive people back to their political core, \nwhich has probably contributed not only to a lack of \nparticipation but even by those who participate to a disgust \nwith the choices they have to make?"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Speaker Gingrich. I am certainly willing to look at how you \ncould do it given our constitutional right of free speech. I \nmean, I do think there is something inherently wrong with a \nsystem where you have the right smear for the last four days \nyou undo two or three years of hard, sincere work, and somebody \nwho doesn't have a clue what they are doing can buy an office \nfor--with 50.1 percent of the vote because they had the best \nhired gun. And this is a problem we see across the board.\n    You see the same thing, frankly, with trial lawyers in \nterms of who can hire the best guy to go into court, and I \nthink it is a problem of a money society, that when commerce \nbecomes dominant values tend to decay. So if we can find a way, \nwhether it is, for example, requiring the candidate to appear \nin the same ad, and I don't know if that would be legal or not \nlegal, but I mean some device that reestablishes a sense of \nresponsibility.\n    It does--the other point I would make, I guess, Mr. Fazio, \nwhich I have been struck by because of my interest in what is \nhappening to the Information Age, about the point we figure out \nwhat we would do with the world that had three networks, there \nare going to be 500 channels. And I have not got a clue what \nthat is going to be, but probably it is going to mean that no \nsingle ad ever hits anybody anymore. You are going to have this \nvery divergent----"
"fazio","Mr. Fazio","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    We are targeting our TV spots like we do direct \nmail.\n    Speaker Gingrich. I used to think it would be a good idea \nto have some kind of a time requirement, like the British and \nCanadian model. The problem that you have now is that between \ngoing to Blockbuster to rent the movie and flipping channels, \nyou know, people would simply manage to find a new way to avoid \nthe information.\n    So it is--one of the things you may want to consider, and I \ndon't know what the financing would be or how we would do it \nethically or whether a foundation could do it in a way that was \nethical, it would be very interesting to have a series of focus \ngroups that just--that asks citizens how do you get \ninformation, how would you--how would you like to get \ninformation and would you actually do it? And maybe even as we \nbegin some primaries next year, looking at it in a kind of \nreal-time way because I think sometimes we sit up here, we are \nfascinated with politics and we read the Post and the New York \nTimes and the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Times and \neverything we can get our hands on, all of our back home \npapers, so we are drowning in data.\n    But if you look at this morning's paper that says 60 \npercent of graduating high school seniors fail any knowledge of \nAmerican history, it is sort of a grim reminder that there is a \ngrowing noncivic population that, frankly, doesn't learn much \nabout anything. They know about O.J. but they don't know much \nabout Bosnia and they sure don't know much about the budget, \nand they don't have a clue what the word ``reconciliation'' \nmeans.\n    I would just suggest to you that we ought--I would like to \nvisit all of that, even having a constitutional lawyer standing \nnear us nodding yes and no. But I think we could be more \ncreative in moving towards an information-filled campaign \nrather than a smear-filled campaign, and I would like to see \nthat on the table very much."

"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    The Chairman. Does the gentleman from Michigan wish to \ninquire?\n    Mr. Ehlers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    First of all, Mr. Speaker, thank you, once again, for your \nexcellent testimony and bringing the larger perspective, as you \nalways do. As a relative newcomer here, I appreciate the \nhistorical perspective you laid out, too, and I want to tell \nyou that.\n    I also appreciate your mention of the self-funded \ncampaigns. I, as the gentleman from Florida indicated earlier, \nam not a person of means. In fact, every job I have ever had in \nmy life paid me less than the job I had before, until I came to \nCongress. I went from teaching at Berkeley to teaching at \nCalvin College to the State Legislature, and it was downhill \nall the way. So when I ran for Congress, I obviously did not \nhave a great deal of personal wealth; I had virtually nothing.\n    I faced four millionaires, three in the primary and one in \nthe general, each of whom spent $400,000. I spent $140,000 and \nwon. I think part of it is the volunteers. I had 1,000 \nvolunteers. They each had a handful. You can win without money, \nbut it is difficult when you face opponents who have unlimited \ncheckbooks and pocketbooks and don't even have to go to the \npeople for their money. And that is an issue I believe has to \nbe addressed.\n    The other question I have for you relates to the commission \nthat you suggested, which I know you had previously discussed \nwith the President and with Bob Dole. My question is \nspecifically, and you mentioned the main one, what is the \ntimetable for the commission, which is perhaps equivalent to \nour timetable, maybe even a little faster, and then the real \nquestion is how is their work going to meld with our committee \nwork?\n    Speaker Gingrich. Well, I would hope ideally if we could do \nthis that if we could work it out--as I said, I think this will \nbe the committee of jurisdiction so obviously Chairman Thomas \nand Mr. Fazio would play a lead role if we went down this road, \nif the President thought it made sense.\n    But I would hope that the Senate committee, the House \ncommittee, and the commission would work as a team, think \nthrough the work to be done and share information and resources \nand ideas so that you would have all spring a blending together \nand a dialogue. I mean, I don't think they need to be out here \nin some separate track on their own and then magically appear \non around May 1st.\n    I think it ought to be--you know, as you know from the way \nwe work together, I really believe in building bigger and \nbigger teams and getting more and more people in a common \ndialogue and in the Information Age. There is no reason with \nbulletin boards and conference calls and teleconferencing that \nyou can't do it. So I would hope that they would be \nsupplemental to and also would draw upon the expertise of the \ncommittees.\n    I mean, a number of us have been through this three or four \ntimes already. We know it won't work. We can be of great advice \nto the committee in saying, let me tell you, you go down that \nparticular alley, you haven't got a prayer of getting it done.\n    Mr. Ehlers. I guess my concern is that it sounded as if you \nwere saying this would be like the Base Closing Commission, \nthat their "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","recommendations would go directly to the Floor and not to the \ncommittee.\n    Speaker Gingrich. I think my proposal here, and I think the \nPresident would have to sign off and we would have to see if \nthe House and Senate leadership would sign off, my proposal \nwould be that if you had eight on each side, if they--if there \nwas an idea so popular that two-thirds of the commission voted \nfor it, that it is reasonable for that to come straight to the \nFloor, much like the Base Closing Commission, but I also think \nyou would see that emerging through drafts and through \ndialogue, and, again, I don't think it can be done in a hidden \nroom somewhere and then thrown over the door.\n    But it does seem to me, on the other side, if you are going \nto ask somebody serious to be on this commission, they have to \nhave some knowledge, some guarantee that their work is not just \ngoing to be one more report filed and not done. So I think--but \nthat would mean you would have to have several Democrats join \nwith the Republicans or several Republicans join with the \nDemocrats or some mix in order to get to a two-thirds vote for \nthe commission to work. That would be my only point.\n     Mr. Ehlers. Thank you. I think it would be very important, \nonce again, to establish the rules for the open meetings \nrequirements and so forth. Frankly, I would feel more \ncomfortable with the normal constitutional requirement of a \nthree-fourths majority.\n    Speaker Gingrich. That is negotiable, I think from both \nsides.\n    Mr. Ehlers. But I seriously want them to mesh carefully \nwith what we are doing, because I think that the Chairman has \noutlined an ambitious program and we are all very serious about \ndoing this and doing this right. Thank you.\n    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman.\n    Let me tell the gentleman from Michigan that although this \ncommittee clearly has jurisdiction over the Federal question, \nthe idea of moving a commission which is bipartisan, looking at \nthe larger question in the larger context is, I think, a \npositive one, because all of the discussion that has been \ncarried on this morning by the Speaker is going on at the State \nlevel as well.\n    Just for an example in California, which has tried to pass \nsome kind of spending limits, some of them less wise than \nothers, we currently have virtually no limits and we are in the \nprocess right now, because of the recall structure in \nCalifornia, of having folks who get elected have to get elected \ninside of the election cycle with millions of dollars spent \nbecause of no limits. Some of the material and background \ndiscussion that would go on at the commission level, which \nwould probably be primarily focused at the Federal level, could \nhave, I think, a very beneficial effect in shifting the debate \nnot just at the Federal level but at the State level as well so \nthat people can better understand the question of dollars in \nthe system and, in fact, power as the Speaker described it.\n    So I think elevating it to that level would be very \nbeneficial not just for us at the Federal level but for those \nof us who are struggling about those same questions at the \nState level.\n    Just let me say that I am now prompted to indicate one of \nmy biases because I do not want to have it go unnoticed."

But at the same time, I think we have \nto use this occasion to step back from these kinds of narrow \nnuts and bolts reforms and start to think more broadly and more \nboldly about the entire system, about the way people see the \nsystem and what would possibly change the system so that in \nreality and in substance and in perception the American people \nreally believe that the system has been changed dramatically \nfor the good.\n    I don't think we should limit our thinking by the scope of \nexisting laws or court decisions, such as Buckley v. Valeo. I \nthink we need to open our minds to dramatic fundamental change \nin the very nature of political campaigns.\n    First of all, campaigns themselves are far too long. The \nAmerican public is exhausted by the length of campaigns. In the \nHouse, many Members have to begin campaigning for reelection \nthe day after the last election. If you are spending virtually \nall of your time in a never ending election, how can you do \nyour best to serve the people who elected you in the first \nplace? That is why we should look at a serious limit on the \nlength of campaigns, such as in Great Britain, where there is a \nstrict time frame for all electioneering. I think we should \nconsider this idea.\n    Second, candidates need more opportunities to discuss the \nreal issues that people care about and get beyond the slogans \nand sound bites that too often dominate our politics. The \npublic simply doesn't believe that their views make any \ndifference, and how can we talk about the real challenges that \nour country faces, such as falling family incomes or the \ncomplexities of health care policy, through a dense fog of \npolitical slogans, short sound bites, and bumper stickers?\n    We need reform that puts candidates in direct contact with \npeople as often as possible. I have found, in my own \ncampaigning, whether I was running for the city counsel or \nCongress, that door-to-door, person-to-person contact with \nvoters is the most effective way to hear what they have to say \nand to explain what I would like to do to try to address their \nconcerns. It lets them express themselves in a forum that is \nnot intimidating to them and allows me to give thoughtful \nanswers. We must increase these opportunities for a true \ndialogue with the voters if we have any hope of restoring their \nfaith in the system.\n    Third, it is time to take a serious look at the role of \npaid advertising in campaigns. Advertising has become a major \npart of the way most campaigns for Congress are run today. And \nwe are seeing more and more ads by groups that are not even \nconnected with the candidate's campaign. This sea of angry \nvoices threatens to drown out all the seriousness and \nsubstance. We have got to begin to explore ways to limit or to \nat least counter the impact of all of these kinds of ads.\n    Fourth, voters need to become more involved in the \nelectoral process. Our turnout in elections is a national \ndisgrace. Less than 40 percent of all eligible voters went to \nthe polls in the last election. How can any of us claim a \nmandate to govern when so few Americans are even part of the \nbasic decision of who will go to the House of Representatives? \nI think we have got to be open to a new "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jefferson","Mr. Jefferson","variety of solutions; different days for voting, regional primaries, \nmail-in ballots, and other ideas should be considered in this \nreform process.\n    I think all of us are disappointed with Congress when it \ncomes to campaign reform. To be perfectly frank, it is hard for \nme to even understand why there has been so much delay on our \nmost basic reforms, reforms that already passed the Senate by a \nbroad bipartisan margin. Our political system, as has been said \nby many, is in near crisis. Too many people simply don't think \nwe work for them; that we are too closely tied to special \ninterests and to lobbyists. That is why we need immediate \nbipartisan attention to this issue. It won't be enough to \nsimply put curbs on the supply of campaign money. We have got \nto reduce the demand, by fundamentally restructuring the ways \nin which campaigns are run and organized.\n    We have got to replace the mudslinging with more \nsubstantive and serious discussion of serious issues. If we \ncannot convince people that their voices really will be heard, \nthat their votes do, indeed, make a difference, then in my \nopinion we are virtually begging them to abandon our political \nprocess and that would be the greatest disaster of all for the \nCongress, for the country, and for the future of the democracy \nitself.\n    I understand in previous testimony the Speaker suggested a \nbipartisan commission to be appointed by the leadership and the \nCongress and the President to report some time in the late \nspring. I think that is a good idea, and I would be happy to do \nmy small part in cooperating with that idea, and I just hope \nthat if such a commission comes about that that commissioners \nwill go into an analysis and open their minds to the new \nthinking and new ideas that are out there.\n    Senator Bradley put some ideas on the table the other day. \nThey may not be all worked out in great detail. There are other \nideas that have been out there. We ought to cast a wide net to \nget every possible idea. We ought to open our minds to the \ngreatest extent possible, and we should, in a bipartisan way, \ntry to find the very best approach that, in reality, in \nsubstance and in perception, will bring about dramatic change \nin the way we run political campaigns in this country, \ncertainly for the Congress of the United States. And I pledge \nto you that I will do everything in my power, within my party \nand with my colleagues, both Republican and Democratic, to try \nto reach that conclusion.\n    I thank you for letting me be here and I look forward to \nanswering any questions.\n    The Chairman. Thank you very much."

"","","jefferson","Mr. Jefferson","    The Chairman. In fact, the Speaker went on a far broader \nbasis, that in terms of talking about political power in a \nbroader sense outside of even the elected political arena and \nthe finances of campaigns to the question of political dollars \nspent, and that oftentimes the amount of money spent inside the \npolitical arena pales in comparison to money spent in other \nareas. I can assure you, as a member of the new Majority, and \nthrough circumstances Chairman of this committee, that we will \nnot move issues that create cynicism among the public on narrow \npartisan basis. Frankly, I have a number of examples in \nprevious campaign finance legislation that passed the House \nunder the previous Majority, and I am not going to go into them \nat this point because I don't think it serves a positive \npurpose.\n     I think what we ought to do is look to the future, look to \nnew ideas, as you indicated, and frankly seek out a number of \nsources to comment on what we ought to do. That probably ought \nnot to be the criteria to meld the structure, and that is why I \nam interested in more details of the Speaker's suggestion of a \ncommission with both Republicans and Democrats, participation \nby House Senate and the President, which would cast a far \nbroader net than we usually deal with in making those \ndecisions.\n     Anyone wish to inquire of the Minority Leader? The \ngentleman from California?"
"fazio","Mr. Fazio","jefferson","Mr. Jefferson","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n     I know from lots of contact from the Leader that he is \nreligious in his dedication to spending his weekends walking \nhis district. I am sure when he was an alderman in St. Louis it \nwas a smaller district and an easier one to get around than his \ncurrent congressional district, but I think it is typical of \nMembers who struggle to somehow connect with people, despite \nthe fact that we live in a mass society, that we have so many \npeople to represent and have to rely so much on the media, and \non paid advertising to really impact.\n     You know, our country has seen a decline in the civic \nculture--the Norman Rockwell painting of the New England town \nmeeting is really not the reality of what we have out in our \nconstituencies these days.\n     Let me ask you, and this is really a blue sky question, \nsome have advocated that despite the fact that 435 of us are an \nunwieldy number in the best of circumstances, that we try to \nshrink our districts even more and somehow get closer in \nabsolute numbers to the real people we represent, because in \nfact when you are talking 600,000 people, you are an awfully \nlong way from having the kind of contact with them that I know \nyou work so hard to get in any spare moment.\n    Is there a way we could somehow scale down our districts? \nIs there a way we could find--you know, we are cutting back on \nfranking and things that we used to think helped make that \nconnection. How do we bridge the gap, the yawning gap, between \nthe public and their elected Representatives, where people \nthink it doesn't matter what I do, including voting or \ncontributing?\n     Mr. Gephardt. Well, I think we are in a day when we have \ntechnology available that will allow us to have more contact, \nmore input. We are not far away from the day when people can \nregister "

"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","their opinion in a survey through their television or their computer \nthat would give us lots of instant data from people about their \nopinions on particular issues. We have had, obviously, the \nadvent of television now for a long, long time. I don't think \nwe have ever used it properly in the political sense. We don't \nhave the kind of interactive town hall meetings, the kind of \nabilities that I think are even there today that we ought to be \nthinking about doing something about. It could be that the \nHouse of Representatives could make available to Members the \nability, through technology, to have interactive television \ntown hall meetings, with lots and lots of their constituents on \na regular basis while they are doing their duties here in \nWashington.\n     I don't think, to answer your question specifically, that \nwe could seriously entertain the idea of increasing the number \nof representatives. I think that would not be met with a lot of \nacclaim. I think we have to use the number we have with the \nnumber of constituents we have, but increase the use of \ntechnology to actually reach people and deal with people.\n     I feel very strongly that we have got to find a way to get \nmore people to participate in elections. I think increasingly \npeople are beginning to understand that elections have \nconsequences but we make it difficult for them to vote.\n     I just have to seriously question, why do we insist on \nhaving a vote on a workday when, in many, many industrialized \ndemocracies, they have gone to Saturday and Sunday voting in \norder to give people the maximum opportunity to actually go and \nvote and participate.\n    Finally--and this is the reason I hope we are in a new day \nhere with campaign reform--it really troubles me that people \nhave such an incorrect vision of what this body is about. It \nreally bothers me, because I know my colleagues, I know how \nhard you work, I know how serious people here are, I know how \nwell-intentioned people here are.\n     And to see the perception of the public that this place is \nabsolutely run by special interests and lobbyists really \nbothers me, because I know it is not true. I also know that if \npeople believe it is true it probably is true; perception \nbecomes reality. If we break the faith of the American people \nin their representative government, we have really lost \nsomething that is very, very valuable and hard to get back.\n     So we have got to search--none of us has a corner on \nknowledge here--we have to search for everybody's best judgment \nand best ideas on how to reconnect the representatives here \nwith their people in any way that that can be done, even to the \npoint of shrinking districts and having the ability to do more \ndoor-to-door and more town hall meetings and more individual \ncommunication.\n    The Chairman. Thank you. I thank the gentleman.\n     The Chair would invite the Minority Leader, in the most \nsincere manner, based on the statements he just made, to \nexamine his opening remarks in regard to the way in which \nthings are occurring around here. I have some concern \nreconciling the two statements.\n     Does the gentleman from Michigan wish to inquire?\n     Mr. Ehlers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","     First of all, I want to reassure the Minority Leader that, \nthanks to this committee, that technology is now there. First \nof all, your citizens can watch the Congress on C-SPAN. If they \nare interested in a particular bill or amendment being \ndiscussed, they can get on the computer and actually scan the \ntext of it and then, using E-mail, send in their opinion, all \nwithin the space of a half hour while the debate is still in \nprogress.\n     That, of course, assumes they have a computer, and that \nmeans there is some demographic selection going on. But I \nanticipate within a decade or two everyone will have that \ncapability.\n     Your other suggestion of interactive town meetings raises \nan interesting point, however, because that is also available \nright now. In fact, I just conducted one this morning, not a \ntown meeting with my constituents but a give-and-take meeting \nwith a group of scientists meeting in Ann Arbor. The cost for \nthe satellite time was roughly $1,000 for a half hour, which \nthey paid as part of their conference fee. We can do the same \nwith our constituents, but who pays the $1,000? And if the \nHouse pays it, then of course your potential opponents would \ncry that we have an advantage from our incumbency. If we pay it \npersonally, we have to raise the money somehow.\n     The question is, where does the money come from?\n     That gets back to the crux of the matter. I think the \nproblem with connecting with our constituents is not so much a \nmatter of either technology or our will or desire, it is the \nother issue you raised earlier, 40 percent participation in \nvoting, which is the easiest act of citizenship. The more \ndifficult ones are participating in the process.\n    With the town meetings I hold in my district, altogether I \nprobably have 500 in attendance over the course of the year, \nwhich is less than 1/1,000th of the population of my district. \nSo I think what we have to do is try to address the citizen \ninterest factor in every way possible.\n     Getting back to specific questions, you mentioned you \nwould like to replace mud slinging with reasonable voices. I \ncertainly agree with you on that.\n     Do you have any suggestions of any legislation that we \ncould pass that would control negative campaigning without \ninfringing on First Amendment rights? That is something I have \nstruggled with for years.\n    Mr. Gephardt. It is very difficult. I think if you were, in \na dramatic way, going to affect the kind of communication that \ngoes on in campaigns, you would have to do something in the \nConstitution with the First Amendment as it relates to \npolitical campaigns. There are a lot of Americans who wouldn't \nwant to even entertain that idea, much less do it. So you have \ngot to be very careful about it.\n    But I think it is time for a real soul-searching discussion \namong all of us about what is happening in campaigns and \nwhether 30-second spots are appropriate to a political \nexercise.\n    Maybe we will decide, as I suspect we might, that the First \nAmendment should not be changed in any way for the purpose of \npolitical campaigning. But we have to approach that question. \nWe have to have a serious discussion of whether or not we think \nthat "

Thank you.\n    I personally have never used any negative campaigning, but \nI have been a victim of it. I think Congress is largely \nresponsible, certainly partly responsible, for the poor \nreputation we have with the public.\n    I would also like to pick up just briefly, Mr. Chairman----\n    The Chairman. Briefly.\npublic perception. If you look in the history books, it is not \nmuch worse now than it was a hundred years ago.\n    Mr. Gephardt. I don't take a lot of heart from that.\n    Mr. Ehlers. I agree, but I suspect----\n    The Chairman. Or 200.\n    Mr. Ehlers. Like the Lord said, we will always have the \npoor with us, I think politically we will always have the \nskeptics with us."
"hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Would the gentleman yield just a moment?\n    Mr. Ehlers. Just a second. Mr. Fazio used the term--``and I \nknow he is religious''--I know you are a deeply religious \nperson. I don't think you are influenced by the contributions \nyou receive. I am not. Yet the public somehow perceives we are. \nThe question is trying to discern what is really the problem \nhere. Is this a problem of perception, or is it a problem that \nis real, as you implied in your opening comments? I happen to \nthink not.\n    I will be pleased to yield."
"hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    I think the issue is today not that the opinions \nthat are expressed about the Congress or about Presidents are \nnecessarily more harsh. Certainly you can read descriptions of \nThomas Jefferson that all of us would now be reviled by because \nwe revere him.\n    However, the very marked change is the powerful projection \nof those negative views through television which has \ngeometrically increased the disquietude in the American public \nand the level of animus.\n    It is not that the views have changed for those who know, \nwho write the journals and all that sort of stuff, but what has \nhappened is, the public has been inundated.\n    I agree with the gentleman from Michigan, and I have said \nthis in our committee before in years past, we all spend a lot \nof money to denigrate the institution and the participants in \nthe institution on an annual basis, and I think that is the \ndifference. It is not that the views have changed, they are \nprojected more widely and more powerfully.\n    Mr. Gephardt. Can I take a second to chime in on that?

I may be wrong.\n    I don't think there has ever been an instrument of public \npersuasion that is nearly, nearly as powerful as television \nand, in particular, 30-second spots. If it weren't a powerful \ntool, the great corporations of our society would not spend the \namounts of money they spend using it to drive public opinion in \nparticular ways. We need to really examine its role and what it \nhas done to the political atmosphere.\n    The Chairman. Just let me add that everything that has been \nsaid is, I think, correct, and it is focused through the \nmagnifying lens of single-issue politics, which intensifies all \nthe aspects we have been talking about.\n    Does the gentleman from Arizona wish to inquire?"
"pastor","Mr. Pastor","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    I thank the Minority Leader for sharing his thoughts with \nme.\n    As an observer in different countries during the elections, \nI have seen where they have had limited time for campaigning, \nbut one of the things I have also seen is that they stop \ncampaigning a few days before the election, like a cooling off \nperiod, so the concentration is to get out the vote and get \npeople to get ready to vote. So that may be something that we \nmay have an interest in.\n    I agree with you, we make it very hard for voters to \nparticipate, and I would hope that we look at not only the \nmailed-in ballots but also the whole question of registration, \nand make it easier for people to register and vote, beyond the \nmotor-voter idea but maybe on-site registration. I think those \nare things we need to look--at how we make it easier for people \nto vote.\n    One of the themes that the Speaker had this morning--and I \nwould like to have your comments and your thoughts--also dealt \nwith how independent groups now are the more threatening factor \nbecause they push their idea or their issue through the media \nor through volunteers. Somehow we connect that with the demise \nof political parties. I saw this morning as I was walking by \none of the bookstores, a cover story in one of the national \nmagazines that deals with the demise of the Democratic Party.\n    What would you do to strengthen the participation of \npolitical parties so that we may again use that as a vehicle \nfor citizen participation and for the recruiting of potential \ncandidates?\n    Mr. Gephardt. Let me say that I think this great diverse \ndemocracy has been greatly helped through history--and we are \nnow the oldest democracy in the world--by having a large tent \nbut a small number of political parties.\n    What I am afraid is happening because of all the phenomena \nwe are talking about today is we are seeing a proliferation of \nparties and I think it is going to continue unless we can bring \nabout, as I have said, dramatic campaign reform.\n    If you look across the history of other democracies, in \nmany of them there has been a real atomization of parties, \nspecial interest parties, parties representing very narrow \ngroups within the society."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","pastor","Mr. Pastor","That is beginning to happen in this society. I think it will continue \nunless we can bring about very effective, dramatic campaign \nreform.\n    That is not the only thing, we have got other problems that \nare causing this, but this is part of the reason this is \nhappening.\n    So one of the things I think we have to look at in campaign \nreform specifically, to answer your question, is that we cannot \nstarve parties of the ability, the financial ability, to \noperate as parties: their ability to register voters, their \nability to get voters to vote, their ability to help campaigns \nbe mounted, their ability to go out and find good people to run \nfor political office.\n    If we are going to have successful, large-tent political \nparties that are effective in what they are doing, they have \ngot to have the resources to be effective in doing it. So in \nwriting campaign reform, we don't want to make it impossible \nfor them to raise the resources they need to run their \ncampaigns and to be an effective political unit.\n    The other thing, when you only have two parties, what I \nthink we benefit from is you get public servants who are \nwilling, because they have had help from that party to get \nelected, to represent the broadest view. They are then not \nbeholden to this special interest or that special interest and \nanother special interest to get elected. They can rely on the \nparty to help them get elected, which has the broader view of \nthe good of the whole society.\n    I think that is an extremely important reason to keep the \nlarge political parties that we have had in mind as we go \nthrough campaign reform.\n    The Chairman. I will tell the Minority Leader, who was not \nhere for my opening remarks, that we are planning to hold a \nseries of hearings focusing on funds availability to the \ncandidate. One of the hearings will clearly be on the role of \npolitical parties. Perhaps the 1970s legislation defined \npolitical parties as even less than PACs in some ways. We have \nto go back historically and take a look.\n    I appreciate your comments on political parties.\n    Does the gentleman from Maryland wish to get in on his own \ntime?"
"hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","pastor","Mr. Pastor","    Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to make an \nobservation, because the Speaker brought up Broder's book with \nreference to decline of parties. Of course in Broder's book he \nspoke of the consequences of that, which, in my opinion, was \nlargely accelerated by the 1974 election and, frankly, by \ncampaign finance reform.\n    Let me make an observation. GOPAC is very controversial \nobviously, but GOPAC was used as a unifying force by the \nSpeaker, where he reached out to a lot of people of like \nphilosophical mind and objective and created a cohesion that he \nnow displays as the Speaker. Historically, parties did that.\n    With the limitation on parties' ability to fund the \ncandidates, we may want to think about going the other way in \ncampaign finance reform of $10,000. That is for most of us an \ninconsequential sum, making parties relatively irrelevant. They \ncan give other in-kind services, but as we have diminished \nparties' ability to impact on elections, it is not surprising \nthat we have seen a disintegration, which the public has seen \nas gridlock and the lack of consensus and the inability of \nleaders to lead."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    In fact, GOPAC to some degree replaced the party. In fact, \nleadership PACs to some degree attempt to give leaders--this is \nin State legislatures who are doing it, at the Federal level--\nattempt to give leaders the ability to impact on policy by \npromoting candidates who shared their views and will cooperate \nwith them in pursuing policies. People obviously respond to \nthat. That is bad, because what it does is, it centralizes \npower.\n    Since 1974 there has been, and before that, a great \nsuspicion of centralized power, but we have paid a price for \nthe disintegration of centralization. Frankly, I am an admirer \nto some degree of the Speaker's centralization to impact \npolicy. While I may disagree with many of the policies he tries \nto promote through that mechanism, it is, in my opinion, a \nproblem that our party experienced in the 1974 post period \nwhere we diminished the Speaker's power and diminished \nleadership power and enhanced, frankly, committee power. But we \nhad a lot of power centers and were, in some respects, through \ncampaign finance mechanisms but other mechanisms as well, \nunable to focus on policy promotion.\n    Mr. Gephardt. Let me just make an idea here: that is, \nalways, throughout the history of our country, we have run \nsomewhere between chaos and very centralized power, almost a \ntotalitarian system. We are kind of looking at the green grass \non the other side of the fence.\n    The great genius of this system that we have, I think, is \nthat it is somewhere between what is a more parliamentary \nsystem, with a more centralized power and something that really \nrequires consensus building.\n    I happen to believe that while I get terribly frustrated, \nas we all do, with the consensus building that has to go on \naround here, that it is the only way a diverse country like \nthis can really operate. People really do have to feel like \nthey have an oar in the water and they have a say.\n    But when you go so far toward consensus that you have \nchaos, and you have no ability to make decisions and move the \nsociety, then you have gone too far in that direction. I think \nwe have achieved that golden mean.\n    One of the ways we have done that is through these two \nbroad-tent parties, and I think that if we go towards very \nnarrow parties and lots of them, we are going to pay a very \nheavy price in terms of our ability to get anything done in \nthis society.\n    The Chairman. Last to inquire, the gentlewoman from \nWashington.\n    Ms. Dunn. I thank the Chairman.\n    I just want to bring a note of irony to our discussion \ntoday. First of all, I want to commend everybody on the \ndiscussion. I think we are finally getting into this topic, and \nit is very interesting for me to sit here and to hear debate \nthat will be educational for anybody who takes the time to \nlisten to C-SPAN on this issue.\n    Mr. Chairman, I want to commend you for having these open \nhearings. I will simply tell you that two and a half years ago \nwhen I came as a new freshman to this Congress, I wanted to be \non this committee because I was a former party Chairman, and I \nbrought some expertise to the subcommittee that I then sat on, \nwhich was the Elections Subcommittee."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    I will remind the Chairman, however, that all the work of \nthat committee on campaign finance reform was brought directly \nby the Majority to our full Committee, with very little input \nby any of us, so very little opportunity for folks watching C-\nSPAN who wanted to understand thoroughly the issues to really \nhave that opportunity. So I think it is great that we are \nholding these hearings now. I want to thank you for that great \nchance to get involved.\n    I enjoyed Mr. Pastor's question of the Leader, and, Mr. \nLeader, I enjoyed your answer. I think the discussion that has \ngone on about parties and the need to strengthen them is very \nimportant. Regarding Mr. Hoyer's contribution to that \ndiscussion--I was a former party Chairman for 11 years. I \nshared the frustrations that all of you have been through in \ntrying to find candidates to run for office and to try to get \npeople interested in voting. It is just a terribly \ndissatisfying feeling, in trying to raise money to help \ncandidates, get the word out, send the mailings out, all the \nthings we have had to do in our various political backgrounds.\n    So I am very sensitive to that, and I am very eager to find \nthe answer as to how we strengthen the two-party system in the \nUnited States because, I agree with you, Leader, that is what \nwe have to do.\n    I am now a member of a different committee, the Ways and \nMeans Committee, and my question to you is: Do you see ways in \nwhich we could use the Tax Code to encourage participation by \nindividuals in political campaigns? For example, what are your \nthoughts on incentives like giving a tax credit to a \ncontributor who is willing to give $100 or less?\n    Mr. Gephardt. Well, we had that at one time, as you know, \nin the Code, and I thought it was a sensible thing to have.\n    Obviously, as with all issues, everything is complicated in \nthe world, so I am, along with Mr. Armey and others, now \nadvocating a flat tax, or a flatter tax, that has no deductions \nand no credits. So we all wind up meeting ourselves coming \nthrough the door on issues like this, and I have to put in that \ndisclaimer.\n    But if we can find a way that is sensible, that meets our \nother objectives, to encourage ordinary citizens to become \ninvolved in the political process with small contributions and \nto be part of the system, I think it is a very, very, very \npositive thing to do.\n    Part of the reason I think Americans have not been \nparticularly political or ideological or interested is, \nfrankly, our country has been a huge success, things have gone \nwell, the economy has been growing, people feel like they are \nokay and they don't need the political system. It is kind of, \n``Leave me alone and I'll be fine.''\n    I think as the economy has contracted for a lot of middle-\nincome Americans over the past 25 years, I think people have \ngotten more politically charged and interested and maybe in a \nway that is good, but it has to be channeled and they have got \nto find ways that they feel they can be effective. One way is \nto contribute and participate in local campaigns, campaigns for \npeople for Congress, for city council, for mayor, whatever.\n    Obviously, if we can encourage those small contributions \nthat gets them involved, people tend to follow their money. \nThey put money in a campaign, then they do other things in a \ncampaign, and that is very positive."

"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    Mr. Jacobs. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Under Federal statute it is now not permissible for any \nprivate interest to finance any part of the operation of a \ncongressional office. That is a fairly recent statute. I think \nit was about the mid-1970s that that happened.\n    My view is that the selection process should be raised to \nthe sanctity of the serving process. In Robert Bolt's play, ``A \nMan For All Seasons,'' Thomas More is emerging from court as a \njudge, and someone tenders a basket of apples to him, and he \ndeclines and replies, ``To sweeten my judgment?''and declines \nthe apples.\n    I am a former police officer. If anybody had given anything \nof value to me in the discharge of my duties, the result would \nhave been rather simple; it would have been, ``Good afternoon, \nSheriff; good morning, Judge; and good evening, Warden.'' That \nwould be about all there was to it.\n    I think the Congress of the United States deserves that \ndignity, that objectivity.\n    I hear it said that contributions don't influence people. I \nam not prepared to argue whether they do or not, but I am \nprepared to argue this: If you are into bench pressing, there \nare two ways you can do it, you can do it with dead-weighting, \nor in latter days they have invented hydraulic mechanisms, and \nthe harder you push on the mechanism, the more weight you are \npushing away. You can deceive yourself. If you do it at 7:00 \no'clock in the morning, then it might really be 180 pounds, but \nif you use the same mechanism at 5:00 p.m., you might think you \nare doing 180 pounds but in fact be doing about 130. Very \nsubjective, and subconscious.\n    So I think it is with PAC contributions. Do they influence \nyou or do they not? Or do you even know, or do I know \nsubconsciously whether they influence me?\n    Now there is one way you can know that they don't influence \nyou, and that is if there isn't any. That way, not only you--\nthat should be important--but the public can know that they are \nnot influencing you because they don't take place.\n    Now, I don't think you can do this in a vacuum. I am among \nthose who believe the British system is the best, and that is \nwhat I have proposed. Outlaw private contributions altogether, \nthe same "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","as we do in the operation of the congressional offices. The richest \nrancher is not going to buy the sheriff his gun.\n    I don't think that the scheme should involve one nickel to \nany campaign committee. I think we should recognize that the \nprimary legitimate function of a campaign is to communicate \nideas.\n    I think that the public would be buying itself two things: \nassurance that money is not influencing or sweetening the \njudgment of public officials, and, second, the opportunity to \nhear all candidates, splinter parties or whatever, independent \ncandidates, whoever achieves ballot position by the requisite \nprocedures of the several States. You have the opportunity to \nhear ideas you never would hear otherwise because the lobbyists \nno longer would be the gate keepers of the television camera. \nAnd you might be surprised.\n    Our Minority Leader, Mr. Gephardt, spoke about the \nimportance of maintaining the two parties. Well, I am in one of \nthe parties, and Jennifer is in the other one, and I expect we \nwould both be sympathetic with that idea, but the fact is, a \nsplinter party may well become the majority party if it were \never heard from. The better mousetrap, the better idea.\n    The precedent, of course, for public financing of \ncampaigns--which, by the way, lobbyists loathe; they were the \nvery first ones to give the argument, why should I pay? Why \nshould I pay to facility the expression of an idea with which I \ndo not agree? The public does that every day with Members of \nCongress in the bully pulpit at the White House.\n    George Burns and Gracie Allen used to have an old show, and \nthey had the governor of California on one night. His name was \nGoodwin Knight, and his nickname was Goodie Knight. Gracie, in \nher penetrating, Socratic method, said to the governor, ``Now, \ngovernor, are you a Democrat or a Republican?'' and he said, \n``Well, I am a Republican.'' ``Well, now,'' she said, ``do the \nDemocrats have to pay taxes to help pay your salary?'' and he \nsaid, ``Well, yes.'' She said, ``Now, is that fair?''\n    That is my answer to whether it is fair for the public to \nbuy the opportunity to hear all the candidates in equal \nmeasure. My scheme would do nothing more than that. The \ntaxpayers would buy the blocks of television time and radio and \nspace in newspapers, and each candidate who is on the ballot in \nequal measure could go in and say what, if anything, he or she \nstands for during his or her 10 or 15 minutes that night.\n    I was about to say, and I will conclude by saying, the \nprecedent for this is the New England town meeting. The \ntaxpayers paid for the means of communication, which was the \nNew England town hall. Now, it is pretty hard to crowd half a \nmillion or more people into one room anymore, probably always \nwas something of a trick, but unless you believe in angels \ndancing on the head of a pin, that sort of thing, it is \npossible, but it is what they used to have years ago, the town \nmeeting of the air; it was over the radio. Now we can have town \nmeetings of that kind.\n    I think, as my mother would say, that the world would go \naround much faster if we let the lobbyists come in and use \ntheir arguments, and nothing more, to influence legislation. \nThat is precisely what they ought to do.\n    The year I was elected----"

"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    The Chairman. The gentleman has concluded.\n    Mr. Jacobs. I am concluding.\n    The year I was elected to the committee on which your \nChairman serves and on which my good friend serves, the Ways \nand Means Committee, I was elected in January by the Democratic \nCaucus, and about five minutes later the phone started ringing \noff the hook. Every PAC in town wanted to give me money. The \nelection was over, I didn't have any debt, but they still \nwanted to give me money.\n    One guy came in about two years later, and he was \nrepresenting a big corporation, and he said in the omnibus tax \nbill an unintended consequence was happening to his \ncorporation. Before he said that, he unsheathed a check for \n$5,000 to my committee, and I said ``No, I don't take PAC \ncontributions.''\n    And I asked him, ``What were you here for really?'' He told \nme the problem. I said, ``I think you are right. I think it's \nan unintended side swipe at your corporation, and we will have \ntechnical corrections in five weeks, and I'll offer the \namendment.''\n    I did, and it was adopted immediately, a matter of course. \nI don't think his feet touched the floor when he left the \noffice. The very idea that to gain elemental justice didn't \nhave to cost his company $5,000 kind of knocked him out.\n    That is the kind of world I think we learned in high school \ncivics, and that is the kind of world we can achieve if we get \ntogether on it.\n    Thank you.\n    The Chairman.

"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    Mr. Kanjorski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    I like Mr. Jacobs' world. I think it is slightly idyllic \nwith regard to some of the questions it raises and would result \nin the delay of passage of legislation in this area. I think it \nis very important we put a bill together that is acceptable to \nboth parties.\n    I am here because over the last five years in every \nCongress I have introduced a campaign finance reform bill, H.R. \n296. I would appreciate it if the Members would look at it. It \nwas not written from a partisan perspective, and, frankly, it \nis quite bipartisan.\n    I think we have a problem with PACs. I think they have to \nbe limited, but they do serve as a way of raising small amounts \nof money from less affluent people who want to give in a very \nefficient fashion.\n    The experience of raising money from groups that PACs \ngenerally represent, whether labor unions, industries, as you \nknow, is overwhelmingly expensive, and most often we are \nsupporting the restaurant industry or the catering industry, \nand a large portion of the funds that we do raise actually end \nup being costs.\n    So PACs in some way, if controlled, limited, and \nunderstood, and with full disclosure, have some relevant \nimportance. But under my bill I reduce them by 60 percent to a \nmaximum of $2,000. The major part of my bill is to encourage \nlocal contributions.\n    It was interesting, I listened to Ms. Dunn's comment on tax \ncredits. I believe we should have a credit for in-State \ncontributions, a "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","maximum of $200 and a direct match for that amount up to a total \nmaximum of $300,000. You want to put a limit on it.\n    My bill includes a checkoff to provide matching funds to \nmatch the funds contributed by local people in small amounts.\n    I would limit the use of personal wealth to $100,000. No \none should have a need in our society to hunt and market a seat \nin Congress, and we now see this in both parties.\n    We have an uncanny number of individuals in this country \nwho have not come through the political process, who in middle \nage, after great, successful business careers, merely look \naround the country and identified 1 of 20 or so districts, and \nthey have $1 million or $2 million they want to spend and \nbecome a Member of the United States Congress.\n    I don't think they have gone through the undergraduate \nschool or graduate school of politics, and it does count, \nbecause they tend to arrive with a very simplistic approach. I \nam glad the former Chairman of a state legislative committee \nfor the State of Washington is now a Member of Congress. That \nbackground comes with a wealth of experience. All of us know \nmany of our colleagues come with that kind of experience.\n    On the other hand, I also speak from the perspective of a \nformer Republican, so I am very bipartisan. I moved into the \nDemocratic Party when portions of the Rockefeller-Scranton \nRepublican Party no larger existed, when oxygen was no longer \nattainable for them in the fifties and in the early sixties, \nand I saw the Republican Party move a little too far to the \nright from where I was philosophically, and so I find myself \nnow in the Democratic Party.\n    I hasten to say, I am the first Democrat in my family in \nmore than 120 years, so it is very difficult to adjust to the \nextreme left of my current party. I sometimes find myself \nwishing we had a multiple-party system.\n    But I agree with Mr. Gephardt that our system is structured \nin a two-party mode and if we change we have to merely change \nidentifications of people to bring us within the party.\n    But in respect of having changed parties and run for \noffice, I come as a virgin to the Congress. I was never elected \nto a public office before. I ran against an incumbent in the \nDemocratic Party in 1984, if you will, defeated him, one of two \nin the entire decade that was defeated, went on to the General \nElection of 1984 which was dominated by the Reagan landslide, \nand succeeded in winning nonetheless along with a very small \nclass of new Democratic members.\n    Immediately upon my swearing into the office of \nCongressman, my 1986 Republican opponent had already raised \n$400,000 and went on to finance either the second or third most \nexpensive campaign in the United States, outspending me two to \none, with somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.2 to $1.4 million \nin his campaign fund.\n    So immediately upon my election to Congress I had to raise \nmoney in a very fast way, which was very difficult; I was not, \nand am not, used to it. I know the experiences of the lady of \nthe night, and I don't think politicians should be attuned to \nthat nor is that the best experience. Those of us fortunate \nenough to gain the con"

"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","fidence of our constituents know what you have to do to come to \nCongress. We have to find a middle ground.\n    My legislation was worked on with Dr. Norman Ornstein of \nthe American Enterprise Institute. It covers a lot of issues \nthat we have raised in our system. We worked closely to tailor \nthose issues. I think you will find it both balanced, allowing \nfor needs of the Democratic Party and our center city problems \nto raise funds, it works to the benefit of the Republican Party \nin that it encourages participation, but, most of all, it works \nto the benefit of challengers by allowing them to get in and to \naddress the issues that Mr. Jacobs referred to.\n    The most crying problem facing our country is the fact if \nwe don't get able people to run for Congress or other elected \noffices, who are willing to talk about issues and substance \nrather than simplicity, we are going to lose more respect in \nthe public than the little the Congress has now, and I don't \nknow whether that is possible, but I suspect we may accomplish \nit.\n    I would urge my colleagues on the committee to look at H.R. \n296. It is bipartisan. I think it could be passed. People with \nopen minds could, in a bipartisan way, say this is a tool we \ncould use in 1995 and 1996 to make some of the corrections \nwhich we all recognize are needed.\n    Thank you."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    Mr. Inglis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this opportunity. \nI, too, congratulate you on holding these hearings. I think it \nis a great beginning.\n    I was interested in the discussion earlier that the \ncommittee had with the Minority Leader, very interesting \ndiscussion I think, very helpful in identifying for me two \nareas that need some help. One is the fact that we have got \nthis pervasive impact of television on the process, and the \nother is the impact of single-issue orientations in this \nprocess. It seems to me both of those can be addressed by \nsimply eliminating political action committees. Let me explain \nwhy I think both of those we will get to if we simply eliminate \nthe PACs.\n    I should tell you, to begin with, that I ran for Congress \nin 1992 the first time, having never run for office before, \nchallenged an incumbent in a situation where nobody expected us \nto win. I had sort of an unusual approach, I believe, in term \nlimits, and therefore I will limit myself. I believe we should \nabolish PACs. Therefore, I refuse to take any PAC money.\n    At one eventful press conference in my campaign, I hung \nthis sign on the podium, and I said, ``If you send me to \nWashington, I'll hang this sign on the door in Washington.'' It \nsays, ``Notice to all PACs: Remember, you didn't give me a \ndime, and I don't owe you a thing.''\n    It has had a way of warding off evil spirits now that I am \nhere. They seem not to come around too much. It works fairly \nwell, I think.\n    The exciting thing I think that we--the opportunity we have \nin abolishing PACs is to get at this thing of this pervasive \nimpact of television, and where does it come from, of course, \nbut the enormous sums that we raised and spend on campaigns.\n    The reason we must raise those funds is the opponents on \ntelevision. If we sort of put the pin in the balloon and out \ncomes the money from the PACs, I believe there would be less \ntelevision, less purchases of those 30-second attack adds, and \nthat will help significantly.\n    The other part of this is that single-issue orientation. I \nthink there are several critical differences between PAC giving \nand individual giving. Individuals, unlike PACs, give for a \nvariety of reasons. PACs give for a very focused agenda. They \nare after something in particular for their little industry or \ntheir particular need. They give without much emotion. They \ngive solely in order to advance that very narrow agenda.\n    Usually when we talk in terms of single-issue orientations, \nwe are talking about issues like abortion or other things like \nthat. But in the PAC area we have to open our minds to the \nsingle-issue orientation of the PACs. They are after small \nchanges in law, they are not after massive changes. They are \nafter small changes that affect their industry significantly."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    So by eliminating PACs, what we have is the process opened \nup to a much more complex reason for giving rather than a PAC \ngiving with something of a contract for voting, as some of them \nhave moved towards in recent years. You would be passed on \nindividuals who give for very complex reasons. Individuals may \nagree with you on nine issues, disagree on one. That one may \ncause him not to vote or contribute to you.\n    Individuals are complex, PACs are simpleminded; they simply \ngive for a very narrow purpose. That is one critical difference \nbetween PACs and individuals.\n    Another critical difference, of course, is the amounts of \nmoney involved. Individuals, at the maximum, can give $2,000 \nper cycle, PACs did get $10,000, and we know a string of PACs \ncan be organized, and if you get 10 PACs together in the \nstring, the leader of the pack of PACs can give you $100,000. \nThat is a whole lot of money. So this is a very significant \ndifference in that quantitative way between PACs and individual \ncontributions.\n    I believe that that is the way that we really can change \nthis process, by eliminating the political action committee and \nfreeing up Members of Congress to go, rather than to those \nnarrow interests, to go more broadly to their individual \npotential contributors and ask for money. It would be a very \ndifferent system and a system that involves much less money.\n    At that point, we would have more candidates relying on \ndoor-to-door afternoon town hall meetings and that sort of \nthing in order to get out their message, and everyone would \naddress their expectations that that is how I must learn about \nthe candidates, not from the 30-second attack adds.\n    Lest you think it cannot be done, it can be done that way, \nand I know a number of Members of Congress, including Mr. \nPortman to my left, who doesn't take PAC money. In fact, now in \nthe House there are 24 of us who do not take PAC money and \nbelieve we should abolish political action committees, and we \nare here. It does work. It is possible. Of course you run your \ncampaigns with a whole lot more shoe leather and a whole lot \nless television buys, but the result, I think, is a more \ninformed electorate and more involved electorate and an \nelectorate that can see the opportunity for a very different \nkind of Congress.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to testify \ntoday."

"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    Mr. Portman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for having this very \nimportant hearing. I commend you for doing this, and I commend \nthe Members for spending time on this matter.\n    It seems to me we have come to a real opportunity to pass \nserious campaign finance reform, given the opportunity in these \nhearings this afternoon and given the focus the Speaker and the \nMinority Leader have brought to this.\n    I am here to talk about my legislation regarding a PAC ban. \nI would associate myself with a lot of the comments made by the \nprevious speakers with regard to the pervasive influence of \nPACs and the problems with it. I would like to focus on two \nfundamental problems I see in the campaign finance area \ngenerally and suggest that a PAC ban is the best way to solve \nit.\n    Number one is undue influence of special interests. My \nfriend from Indiana, Mr. Jacobs, talked about the sweetening \ninfluence. It is there, and I think that should be one of the \nprimary goals of any campaign finance reform effort.\n    Second is the obvious advantages incumbents enjoy in this \nsystem. Even with turnover in the House, which is primarily due \nto retirements, I would argue we still have a situation where \nthere are enormous advantages enjoyed by incumbents which keep \nthe system from being a truly open and competitive process for \nchallengers.\n    The best way to approach those two is through a PAC ban. \nThe PACs have grown enormously, from 608 in 1974 to over 4,000 \ntoday, and the influence they have has increased greatly as \nwell.\n    Today PACs contribute, as most of you know, over half the \nmoney in the congressional races. They also contribute \nsubstantially to the advantages incumbents enjoy. According to \nthe FEC 20-year report, in recent years more than 70 percent of \nPAC contributions have indeed gone to incumbents.\n    In my State of Ohio, for example, PACs supported, on \naverage, incumbents by a margin of 10 to 1 over challengers. So \nby doing away with PACs I think you are going to put money and \ninfluence back where it should be; that is, in the hands of the \nindividuals and in the hands of the voters.\n    Rather than funneling individuals' contributions through \nthe Washington PAC, I would rather encourage individuals to \ncontribute money directly to candidates they believe in. I \nthink you would get a different result. This increases \ncandidate accountability directly to the voters and not to the \nspecial interests that, again, have too much influence over the \nprocess."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    Over the years a lot of concerns have been expressed about \nthe constitutionality of a PAC ban, and I assume we will get \ninto that during the discussion, and I am looking forward it. \nThey cite the Buckley v. Valeo case, where in 1976 the Supreme \nCourt upheld the Federal Election Campaign Act limitations on \ncontributions. Under that reasoning, they were limited as \nappropriate weapons against the reality or appearance of \nimproper influence.\n    Three points of clarification. Number one, the Court has \nnever directly addressed the issue of banning political action \ncommittees. We should remember that. Whether or not PACs are \nconstitutional has not been explicitly cited in Buckley or \nother constitutional cases by the Supreme Court. I would argue \nthere is helpful language in the Buckley opinion with respect \nto the apparent or real corruption.\n    Number two, there are other forms of association that are \nrecognized under the Federal Election Campaign Act; for \nexample, partnerships. It is very interesting to me that if an \nindividual gives money to a partnership and that partnership in \nturn donates contributions to any of us on this panel this \nmorning, that individual's contribution is attributed to the \nindividual, not to the partnership as a whole.\n    Again, of course this isn't the case with PAC \ncontributions. Individuals can give to PACs, and it is not \nattributed back to them for purposes of their own contribution \nlimits. In essence, I don't know that there is a constitutional \nright to give an enhanced contribution merely because one \naffiliates. I think if PACs are banned the problem is cured.\n    In any case, it is clearly wrong for corporations, labor \nunions, and trade associations to use money that would be an \nillegal contribution, if made directly to a campaign, to \nsubsidize PACs, particularly administrative costs of PACs. I \nbelieve banning those subsidies or those PACs that receive \nsubsidies would clearly stand up to the constitutional test.\n    This has to do with the issue of connected PACs. I believe \nthat that clearly is something that would survive \nconstitutional muster and that constitutes the majority of PAC \ncontributions. So at the very least I think we should be in a \nposition of coming together on legislation that would ban \nconnected PACs.\n    For all these reasons and the fact that the makeup of the \nSupreme Court has changed dramatically in the 19 years since \nthe Buckley decision, I think it is not clear that a ban on \nPACs would be found unconstitutional.\n    Furthermore, I think the other alternatives that have been \ndiscussed here today and in the debate generally are \nproblematic. Halfway measures, I think, don't work, we have to \ngo all the way. I think raising the amount individuals can \ncontribute does not fundamentally solve the problem. I think it \nis a short-term fix. It will make one side more or less \nvaluable as a funding source, but it is temporary.\n    Aggregate limits on PAC receipts is a mistake. It will \nplace emphasis on early contributions, thus enhancing the \nadvantages of incumbents who traditionally get these \ncontributions, as lobbyists anticipate what are the best \ncontests to fund."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    There are ownership problems. I think raising the \nindividual limits from $1,000 to $2,000 or $1,500 would \ndiminish the role of PACs. True, but few individuals can afford \na contribution of that size. It doesn't really open the \nprocess. Aggregate spending limits further institutionalize the \ngeneral bias against challengers. So I am not a supporter \ngenerally of the limitations. I think we need to level the \nplaying field until the alternatives are good to do so.\n    I would be concerned about other measures that would be \nattached to a PAC ban that are major campaign finance reforms. \nIt will bog down the process. As a practical matter, I think we \nhave an opportunity to ban PACs and get that done. I would hate \nto see us get bogged down again.\n    In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, let me say that I think H.R. \n356 or any other clean PAC ban legislation is the way to go \nthis year. It is clean, it is tough, it is fair. By banning \naltogether the activity of the PACs, we can make progress in \nmaking elections more competitive and getting the undue special \ninterests' influence lessened in this city. I would encourage \nthis committee to support that kind of a bill.\n    I am pleased to join you later for questions."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    Mr. Whitfield. Mr. Chairman, thank you for this opportunity \nto present testimony on campaign finance reform.\n    My name is Ed Whitfield. I represent the First \nCongressional District of Kentucky. No fewer than 42 bills \naddressing campaign finance reform have been introduced this \nyear. These bills limit campaign spending, place limits on out-\nof-State, out-of-district contributions, subsidize postal and \nbroadcast rates for campaigns, and eliminate PACs.\n    One thing is certain about these proposals. The Federal \nElection Commission will soon become one of the largest Federal \nagencies, this at a time when we are trying to limit the role \nand size of government.\n    However, I do agree campaign finance laws are not perfect \nand changes should be initiated to make them more equitable for \nchallengers.\n    In spite of the incredible turnover in Congress last \nNovember, 80 percent of those elected were incumbents. The \nprimary reason was the advantage incumbents have in obtaining \ncampaign contributions from political action committees. This \nis the only part of campaign finance laws which needs to be \nchanged.\n    Political action committees, far from being an evil force \nthat will destroy our Democratic political process, as some \nallege, are the essence of our democratic system.\n    Today, there are nearly 4,000 political action committees \nrepresenting every faction of our society. Some represent \nteachers, farmers, attorneys and miners, others represent \nreligious denominations or veterans, others represent causes \nsuch as opposition to flag desecration, or whatever.\n    James Madison, in writing in Federalist No. 10, talked \nabout the importance of factions in our country. He basically \nsaid they are the essence of American freedom and liberty. So I \ncome to the conclusion there is no need to fear political \naction committees.\n    PACs represent the various interests of the American \npopulace, and PAC representatives bring important information \nto bear on the process of government for better decision-\nmaking. Exaggerating the evil of campaign money derived from \npolitical action committees and the amount of money spent on \ncampaigns does a disservice to our system of government.\n    In 1968, the cost of political campaigns was three-one-\nhundredths of 1 percent of the gross domestic product. Today, \nit is only six-one-hundredths of 1 percent.\n    The Smith-Shays bill, and most of the other bills, raise \nserious questions about infringement on constitutional rights, \nby not allow"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","ing citizens to exercise their freedoms of speech, association and \npetition.\n    A basic premise of our Constitution as set out in the 1976 \nSupreme Court case of Buckley v. Valeo, is that the First \nAmendment applies with special force to political campaigns.\n    The bill that I have introduced, H.R. 1865, increases the \ncontribution limits for individuals to $3,000 per election, or \n$6,000 per cycle, and decreases the amounts for PACs from the \ncurrent $5,000 to $3,000, or $6,000 per cycle. The objective is \nto level the playing field between challengers and incumbents \nby reducing the contribution levels of PACs and raising the \namount of individuals.\n    My personal experience as a challenger last year was that I \nwas unable to raise PAC money. I had to go to the individuals. \nThey were limited. Many of them would have given more money if \nthey could, but under the Federal laws they could not.\n    Had the contribution limits been indexed 20 years ago, the \nindividual limit would now be over $3,000, and the PAC limit \nwould be over $15,000. My proposal brings the individual limit \nin line with inflation, while reducing PACs' limits by 40 \npercent. Increasing the individual limit recognizes that, in \neffect, over the past 20 years, we have had static contribution \nlimits without price controls on the cost of campaigns.\n    My bill avoids the constitutional implications of \ncompletely banning PACs or placing limits on geographical \ncontributions. It is achievable this Congress, while proposals \nsuch as Smith-Shays face a certain filibuster and \nconstitutional challenge.\n    My bill avoids public subsidies necessitated by the \nspending limit approach, and as we know, subsidies will \nultimately be paid by the American taxpayer.\n    Most important, my bill creates equity for incumbents and \nchallengers.\n    Fundamentally, we have a good campaign finance system. I \nurge Members of the committee to enact a simple common sense \ncampaign finance reform that creates equity for incumbents and \nchallengers. But most important, we do not want a Federal \nbureaucracy micromanaging our campaign system.\n    Thank you.\n    The Chairman. Thank you very much. We appreciate your \ntestimony."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    Mr. Greenwood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for \nholding the hearing.\n    The committee has my testimony so I will simply briefly \nsummarize it.\n    I was invited here because of my introduction of House \nResolution 1432, which bans all PACs of any kind. It is one of \nthe extreme positions.\n    Let me tell you three reasons why I think this is a \nreasonable thing to do, and why it is good for our country and \nfor the future of our country.\n    I think there are three problems associated with political \naction committees: The first of those is that regardless of how \neach of us as a Member of Congress conducts ourselves and how \nmuch we know about the source of our finances and how we manage \nthe relationship between contributions and our positions on the \nissues, what is not debatable is that the PAC system does \nundermine confidence of the American voters in our system. It \nis simply unreasonable to expect Members of Congress to stand \nbefore their constituents and say, yes, it is true, I received \n$50,000 of contributions from the pharmaceutical industry; yes, \nI voted with them yesterday. You need never trouble yourself \nabout the correlation of those two events. It simply is too \nmuch to ask the American people to accept that there is not at \nleast the appearance of a conflict there. And for that reason, \nmore than any other, I think we need to eliminate the PAC \nsystem.\n    The second evil that I think is associated with PACs, or \nthe second problem, is the way in which they, I think, \nundeniably favor incumbent retention and protect the status quo \nand mitigate against change. We all know how the process works.\n    And the example that I use is somewhere out in the farm \nbelt there may have been a fellow who ran for Congress 20 years \nago because he didn't like the way Federal policy affected \nfarmers. And so he ran for Congress and he got elected and he \ndidn't get on the Agriculture Committee, he got on the Fish and \nMarine Committee. And next thing you know he is the Chairman of \nsome subcommittee that has to do with exports, and 20 years \nlater he is a powerful exponent of everyone who is not \nnecessarily in favor of the farmer back home because that is \nwhere his money is coming from.\n    The challenger, 20 years later, finds himself in the same \nplace this fellow did 20 years ago, says I am tired of \nCongressman X, he is constantly voting with the exporters and \nthe shippers and not the farmers, and it is time now to mount a \nchallenge here. By the time that young farmer raises a few \nthousand dollars from his fellow farmers, the big powerful \nincumbent, with his PAC contributions from all over the \ncountry, that have nothing to do with back home, enable him to \nfinance a television campaign against the challenger that wipes \nthe challenger out before he gets started. Resources can be \nfocused from around the country based on a Member's position \nand other special interests. Because of this, I think "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","the system is corrupted as it undermines the ability of a challenger to \nget off the ground.\n    And thirdly, I think that the PAC system causes American \ncitizens who contribute to PACs to become far too narrowly \nfocused in terms of the issues that they consider when \nsupporting a candidate. The doctors are told by their \nassociation, this candidate is good for doctors, this candidate \nis not good for doctors, and the member makes his contribution \nand usually his vote on the basis of that, and doesn't consider \nthe wide array of issues that each of us deals with in \nCongress.\n    I think that if we change to a system in which individuals \ncontribute writing their own personal checks, to the candidate \nof their choice, it will cause them to consider all of the \nissues at stake in an election and not simply the issue that is \nrelated to their profession or a narrow interest.\n    I understand that some people worry about whether they can \nsurvive without PAC contributions. I will tell you that when I \nchallenged a 14-year incumbent in 1992, he spent $1.25 million. \nWe spent $750,000. We both took PAC money. I had challenged him \nnot to. He didn't agree, so we both took PAC money.\n    When I was elected, I decided I would not take PAC money, \nhaven't taken any PAC money since, and what we managed to do is \nbring the cost of the campaign in our district down by about 75 \npercent. There are four United States Senators and I think 24 \nhouse Members who don't accept PAC contributions. I think this \nbrings about a fair fight in each district.\n    Wealthy districts have expensive campaigns, financed by \nindividuals. Low-income districts have low-cost campaigns \ncharacterized by a lot of door-knocking and speech-making and \nless TV, and I think in each district it brings about a fairer \nfight.\n    Finally, I would say that on the question of \nconstitutionality, based on my understanding of the Buckley \ncase, I think the door is open to ban PACs. Because clearly the \nBuckley case talks about the appearance of corruption. Although \nthe word ``corruption'' is rather a strong word, I think that \nthere is enough room constitutionally for us to ban PACs and \nhave it hold up in court.\n    And I yield back the balance of my time."

"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for his testimony.\n    With those of us that are here, it appears to be pretty \nclose to a fair fight. Because Mr. Kanjorski, Mr. Whitfield, \nalthough modifying the amount of money that PACs have, believe \nthey ought to exist. And Mr. Greenwood and Mr. Inglis do not. \nAndy Jacobs doesn't think there should be any private money, \nPAC or individual, in the system. So we have got a relatively \neven discussion opportunity.\n    Obviously, then, those of you who believe that PACs should \nnot be allowed to exist in terms of voluntary associations, \ncombining information and money to assist candidates, that you \ndon't think there is a First Amendment problem with (banning) \nPACs. Obviously, you wouldn't have offered it.\n    Do you believe the question is open, that it could go \neither way, or that you are pretty comfortable that there is no \nFirst Amendment problem with banning the free association and \nthe combining of money for participation in the system?\n    Now, Andy's position would seem to be that you would simply \nignore--pass law that says you can't do any of that. Now, what \nare you going to do?\n    Mr. Jacobs. No, no, I propose a constitutional amendment.\n    The Chairman. Excuse me, correct. A Constitutional \namendment to make sure that there is no individual money \ninvolved.\n    Mr. Jacobs. Yes, I think that is necessary. Of course, I \nwill just elaborate slightly on that. Who was it, Teddy \nRoosevelt said that what is constitutional depends on whether \nthe fifth Justice comes down heads or tails. And I think we \nhave that problem here.\n    As near as I can tell, the theory must have been the old \nAmerican slang expression ``money talks,'' and therefore it was \nentitled to First Amendment privileges.\n    The amendment, Mr. Chairman, that I have proposed, does two \nthings: It states that neither physical desecration of the Flag \nof the United States, nor political contributions of money for \nthe purpose of electing people to public office, shall be \nspeech under this article.\n    As I say, I think you have to stretch your imagination a \nlong way on both of those, and all I want is a little \ncorrectional navigation.\n    Mr. Greenwood. The Buckley, in the Buckley decision, as I \nunderstand the rule, was that the government can restrict \ncontributions only--the only purpose recognized by the Supreme \nCourt to justify such restrictions is the prevention of real or \napparent corruption.\n    As I said in my testimony, corruption is a strong word to \napply here. But I think the use of the word ``apparent'' \nclearly makes it--I think if you ask American citizens if they \nthink the special interest contributions to congressional \ncampaigns corrupt the process, I think clearly you would get a \nrather overwhelming affirmative answer. I think that the--that \nthat gives us more than ample room to sustain constitutional \nchallenge. I am not an attorney.\n    The Chairman. A proposed discussion might be that the same \ndecision removed the limits on individual personal money being \nused in the campaign. Congress in the 1974 amendments to the \nFederal Campaign Act said there were limits on personal money, \nand the Court removed them."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    Is there any general feeling that unlimited personal funds \nhave the appearance of corruption in the system as well? \nPerhaps they could be banned on that same constitutional basis, \nor is that stretching it too far?\n    Mr. Kanjorski. Mr. Chairman, not to get into the \nConstitutional question, because I really think we get off the \npoint, and will never accomplish campaign reform if we get into \nthat. But PACs existed in the United States for hundreds of \nyears in one form or another. In some instances, we called them \ncountry clubs, in some instances we called them union halls. In \nPennsylvania, we used to call them the Pennsylvania Railroad \nand United States Steel.\n    We have seen the abundant ability of a few people to put \nresources together that affect gubernatorial elections, \nsenatorial elections, congressional elections, on down to \nlegislative and local elections.\n    You know, maybe the Congress made a big mistake. On the way \nover, I was thinking about it. If only we had not called them \n``political action committees'' which became known as PACs, \nbecame Pacman, we said instead Democratic Action Committee, and \neverybody is for democracy, it may be a nomenclature problem.\n    The fact of the matter is most people do not realize what a \nPAC is. So many people have campaigned against PACs, they do \nnot realize that you have more accountability and disclosure \nnow in the law, since the campaign reforms of 1970s were put in \nplace, than we ever had.\n    I come today with a unique perspective. There are only two \nMembers of the current Congress who served in the Congress the \nlast time it was controlled by the Republican party. I served \nin the 83rd Congress of the United States as a Page. I saw the \nmakeup of the last Republican Congress. And things have changed \na great deal since then, and those people that didn't have the \nperspective.\n    There wasn't a Member's office then that you couldn't go \ninto at that time, where there wouldn't be a safe. As a matter \nof fact, this very building was designed with the safes in the \nMember's offices. I hope you don't think they were putting \ntheir chess sets in there. They were putting their campaign \nfunds in those safes. And they had bank accounts downtown, in \nthe largest banks, with hundreds of thousands of dollars, \ntotally unaccounted for.\n    It seems to me the corrections of the 1970's, like \npolitical action committees (PACs), was quite a revolutionary \ncorrection. And it has allowed many industries to have an undo \ninfluence on some particular pieces of legislation. And I think \nyou have to worry about that, the pharmaceutical industry, for \nexample, wants some special provision, tax benefits for \noperating in Puerto Rico.\n    But the PACs I receive money from on the Democratic side \nare the carpenters in my district, the plumbers in my district. \nAnd the major difference is they give five bucks a month or two \nbucks a month each to a PAC and they get all of these small \ncontributions together and they send me a check for $1,000 or \n$2,000 to represent 1,500, 2,000 people.\n    If I had to solicit them under our normal process, we would \nprobably spend 50, 60 percent of the funds raised on expenses, \nrunning to restaurants, selling, doing advertising, for that \namount of money. Would that make it any better money?"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    You feel it does make it better money? Well, we differ----\n    The Chairman. Paul, let somebody get in on that in terms of \nif they do feel it is different, why is it different?\n    Mr. Inglis. I think it is considerably different.\n    The Chairman. What is negative about it?\n    Mr. Inglis. In fact, that is what we want you to do. We \nwant you to go to somebody and ask them: Will you come to my \nbaseball event and pay $25 per family and commit to this thing, \nthat endeavor? Rather than having the union hall or the \ncorporation basically impose upon employees or members. And \nthere is extortion, I mean, it is a fairly strong word----\n    Mr. Kanjorski. That is enforcement, that is a question of \nenforcement. If that is occurring----\n    Mr. Inglis. Well, but again if--maybe extortion is a little \ntoo strong a word. We all know, for example, in an United Way \nCampaign, everybody in the accounting firm is expected to give \n``X'' amount of dollars, because they want 100 percent. Now \nthat is not extortion, it is just a social norm. So the social \nnorm at the union or at the office is that you will give to the \nPAC.\n    Mr. Kanjorski. Having lived in both parties----\n    The Chairman. Let me ask a question to try to focus on, \nbecause, Paul, I think I agree with you, if you ask the \nconstitutional question, you are all over the place.\n    If we can set the constitutionality question aside, is \nthere a logical argument for individuals who come together in \nan association having the ability to contribute more to a \ncandidate in a particular election cycle, than individual?\n    Mr. Inglis. If I may address that.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Whitfield's legislation goes directly to \nthat. He says, no, the same amount should go to either. He said \nsince limits were not indexed, the $3,000 amount seems to bring \nit up to date. Ed's legislation goes directly to that.\n    Those of you, even though you may feel you can ban PACs \nconstitutionally, do you believe that if you are wrong there is \na rationale for having a different amount for collections of \npeople versus an individual?\n    Mr. Kanjorski. I think it is a degree of sophistication and \nknowledge. And what you are running against--there was a famous \nSenator who----\n    The Chairman. I really--if somebody has got a specific \nresponse, especially those who are opposed to PACs, because I \nam trying to follow a line of questioning here?\n    Jim, you had your finger up.\n    Mr. Greenwood. The question you asked earlier was is there \nan argument for not having a limit on individual contributions? \nI think there is--there should be a limit on individual \ncontributions.\n    The Chairman. I am not speaking of personal money, the \nCourt has said personal money has no limit. Should there be?\n    Mr. Greenwood. I think there should be a limit. I think it \nmakes some sense to take that $1,000 limit and inflate it up to \n$2,600 or $2,500 or 3,000, whatever inflation would have done \nto it. But I think that the distinction here is if--if Mr. \nKanjorski goes to his district and he invites as many \ncarpenters as he can find who like him in his district and they \nall come with $20 or $50, and "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","to his beef and beer, I don't care whether that adds up to $500 or \n$15,000, if that is how many carpenters he has who live in his \ndistrict who support him.\n    Mr. Kanjorski. And that gets down to the argument----\n    Mr. Greenwood. If I may, what is problematic is when \ncarpenters or when plumbers from all over the country send \nmoney to Washington, and a district has very few, if any, \ncarpenters, this can funnel thousands upon thousands upon \nthousands of dollars in against a challenger who may be \ncompletely consistent with the views on labor management \nrelations in his district.\n    The Chairman. That gets to the point of dealing with the \nmajority-in-district concept or another approach to where the \nfinances come from, but we are going to get into that in \nsubsequent hearings.\n    Mr. Greenwood. Clearly, the PAC system answer is for you. \nIt says that money will flow from the 434 districts to the \n435th.\n    The Chairman. I understand. Are there ways to deal with it \nwithout banning PACs?\n    Mr. Whitfield. In 1994, the National Journal did a survey \nbefore the 1994 election and only 2 percent of the American \npeople even felt campaign finance reform was a significant \nissue.\n    Second of all, the most important thing about campaign \nfinance laws, which we have plenty of, is disclosure and that \nthe voters know who gives money to whom and they can raise an \nissue if it is out of State, in State, or however they want to \ndo it. I think that micromanagement just creates additional \nproblems for the system.\n    The Chairman. And with disclosure, timeliness is required \nand adequate resources to let folks know what was disclosed. My \ntime has expired.\n    I will recognize the gentleman from California."
"fazio","Mr. Fazio","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    I want to apologize to some in the sense I didn't hear your \nstatements and others in the sense I have not been able to \nengage in the questioning. Porter Goss was just listening to me \ntalk about gift and lobby reform over in the Rules Committee \nand he took my remarks for the record there and I told him we \nwould take his here. He would like to join this panel but has \nnot been able to do so.\n    There is no question that PACs have become the symbol of \nspecial interest giving, but I think we all realize that before \nPACs a lot of people gave a lot of money for special interest \npurposes and that was never evident to anybody. It wasn't \nvisible. Wasn't disclosed. It wasn't above the table. \nTherefore, perhaps the public felt better about the process \nbut, in fact, they were not being as well-served by it.\n    I do think it is important to put on the record that the \naverage rank and file union member puts in about 6 cents a week \nand even the corporate PAC contributor contributes something \nlike $3.65 a week to a PAC. Whether we like it or not, it \ninvolves some 12 million people who give to 4,000 PACs, some \nmore than one.\n    When we go to simply allowing individual donors to \ndominate, I think we do tend to go back, one, to an era where \ndisclosure was not as prevalent and as useful, where putting \ndown ``lawyer'' or ``homemaker'' didn't really indicate why you \nhad given."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    And I think it also would tend, depending on how we would \ndo it, to advantage people of means over people who have little \nto contribute or choose to contribute little. I am well aware \nof people who have been giving $25 for 20 years, immune somehow \nto the ravages of inflation. Many of my givers fall in that \ncategory.\n    I would like to think we could if we do less with PACs in \nterms of what they can contribute, we would also perhaps think \nin terms of limiting what individuals could give. Yet I hear \nsome say, and maybe some of you on this panel, who think we \nneed to reverse it. I think the Speaker said that earlier. \nLimit maybe to a thousand what PACs give and let individuals \ngive $5,000.\n    I think we have to be fair to people of means but not \ndisadvantage people who have little opportunity to contribute \nand who sometimes in their collective wisdom, whether it be a \npro-life pack or teachers group, ought to be in a position to \nspeak louder than their financial wherewithal would normally \npermit them to. I would be interested in anybody's reaction.\n    The Chairman. (To Mr. Greenwood:) You can respond to him."
"fazio","Mr. Fazio","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Jim.\n    Mr. Greenwood. First of all, the fact that the current \nstatus situation is an improvement over the past, I think, is a \ngiven, but I don't think that excuses us from taking the next \nstep towards reform.\n    I think that if you wanted to have disclosure of every \nsingle contribution of any size I don't have a problem with \nthat. We itemize them all anyway. I don't have a problem if \nthey itemize all the occupations.\n    But on the issue of people of means versus people of lesser \nmeans, I think that that is a distraction, frankly. They are \nthe same people giving to the PACs. The union member who gives \nthe average of 6 cents, I am sure that is average, not an \naverage of people who give to PACs, but it is an average of the \nunions. But the union PAC member whose total contribution over \nthe course of the year may be $25, $50, $100 or $200 is still \nable to go to the union hall to an event for a candidate with \nhis personal check and just as they do, as they magnify their \npower of giving through their PACs, they can certainly do that \nwith their numbers. But then they represent the people in the \ndistrict of like mind, people in the district of like mind, \nindividually, freely coming and making a contribution. I know \nit is an organizational problem."

But the PAC individual can give at one time to the \nPACs, the same as people of means can give $1,000 to a PAC and \nso--and they also have the same organizational problems that \nmanagers would have, such as to come to an event for Greenwood \nor Kanjorski. So the means issue is not really pertinent."
"fazio","Mr. Fazio","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Did you have your hand up earlier?\n    Mr. Inglis. It is a mystery to me why someone would \npostulate that it is easier for people of small means to give \nthrough the vehicle of a PAC. I just don't understand it."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Mr. Kanjorski. I think I do.\n    Mr. Inglis. Let me explain why I say that. It is very easy \nfor someone of small means to write the check. Consider if they \nwant to set up a PAC, though. They have to go hire a lawyer to \nestablish the PAC, they have to have an accountant, all the \nstructures. Clearly, it benefits structures and not \nindividuals. Those are clearly designed, tilted in favor of \neither corporations or large labor unions. They are not tilted \nin favor of somebody at home who just wants to write a check. \nIt is clearly harder to give through the vehicle of a PAC.\n    The ownership is very important. I think that is what Mr. \nGreenwood was getting at, too, the sense of belonging to the \nMember of Congress and being part of his or her band is a very \nimportant part of America. We want people to believe in that \ncandidate, to go and have the refreshments with the candidate \nand mix with him or her and their family and be part of it."
"fazio","Mr. Fazio","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Let me say I think we are generalizing because I \nknow there are corporate PACs and labor unions that are very \nclosely tied to their members who are givers. For example, the \npostal workers will always have at your fund-raiser the people \nwho are members of their union in the community to make sure \nthat it is just not a check from some lobbyist. They want you \nto know who is there. The Farm Bureau will typically have \npeople at the meeting who are actually contributors to their \nPAC.\n    Now, I have to say not everyone operates the way those \nentities do. There are some far more impersonal but you may \nwant to go to the questions of democracy with a small ``d'' \nwithin the PACs or whether or not they ought to be able to use \ncorporate or treasury union money to solicit for funds.\n    Some organizational structures do lend a great deal of \nbackground and financial substance. The overhead for fund-\nraising and others are much more dependent on the interests of \nthe individuals to give. That is also true of PACs that are \ncreated for single issue purposes where there is a tremendous \namount of fervor and therefore no problem raising the money to \nhire the accountants and lawyers, and, remember, that is there \nbecause we believe so strongly in disclosure and it does remove \nit from the amateur category but for a purpose more important \nto the public.\n    The Chairman. We are operating with timing lights here and \nthere will be an opportunity for a second round of questioning \nif we adhere to the lights. Obviously Members will pursue lines \nof questioning which may or may not coincide.\n    Does the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Ehlers--before you \ninquire let me mention the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Portman, is \nback with us, and regardless of the argument of the \nconstitutionality of PACs or not, he did in his testimony bring \nup a couple of what I consider to be anomalies perhaps where \nindividuals in contributing under one structure, partnerships, \nare counted as individual contributions whereas under a PAC \nstructure they are not.\n    So you have ways to multiply your ability to influence the \nsystem notwithstanding the $1,000 limit on individuals. We are \ngoing to have to focus on that problem whether or not--\nobviously, if you assume PACS are unconstitutional you can \neliminate them. But that "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","is a problem that no one else focused on and I want to bring that into \nthe discussion.\n    The gentleman from Michigan, sorry.\n    Mr. Ehlers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    It seems to me based on the testimony I have heard that the \nreason individuals want to ban PACs is somehow they either do \nillegally influence the behavior of Members of Congress, or \nputting a better cast on it, they give the perception of having \nan influence on the behavior of Members of Congress.\n    I happen incidentally to think that is not true. It would \nbe a blatantly illegal action to do so.\n    But I want to mention something that I have not heard at \nall in terms of influence of PACs. That is not influencing the \nbehavior of individual Members of Congress but rather in \ndetermining who gets elected to Congress.\n    That is an issue that I think should be addressed as being \nfar more pertinent to the matter of PACs. Clearly, I am much \nmore likely to get contributions from the Chamber of Commerce \nthan from the unions, although I do get contributions from \nboth. The Democrats are more likely to get contributions from \nunions than from the Chamber of Commerce.\n    Why is that? It is not because of any individual qualities. \nIt is because they want a Democrat or a Republican elected.\n    So, in a sense, I think if you are talking about the \ndangers of PACs, it is not in changing individual votes or \nindividual behaviors, it is in determining who gets elected in \nthe first place.\n    Mr. Whitfield. Mr. Ehlers, I brought that issue up in my \ntestimony. That was what I perceived to be the most significant \nproblem. In 1994, 80 percent of the people elected were \nincumbents. That is basically because of the disparity in the \nsystem. PACs can give $10,000 in the cycle and individuals can \ngive $2,000. If you are a challenger, you are simply not going \nto receive PAC money.\n    Mr. Ehlers. That may be a factor, although I think there \nare many, many factors in incumbency retention, and the last \ntwo elections gave the lie to most theories of why incumbents \nget reelected. I am sorry I missed your testimony and did not \nhear that point.\n    The other thing that concerns me a little bit about the \ntestimony of those who want to eliminate PACs is there is no \ndiscussion of the influence of individuals. I don't know if \nyour experience is different from mine, but I have never, ever \nhad a PAC approach me and in any way imply they wanted my vote \nin return for a contribution. Never. I have had quite a few \nindividuals talk to me and say ``I gave you $50 and I want you \nto vote this way on this issue.'' We have all had that.\n    What is so terrible about PAC contributions and what is so \ngood about individual contributions? In that regard, I commend \nMr. Jacobs. He will get rid of all of them. But that creates \nyet another problem because in your proposal the incumbent and \nchallenger are treated equally and the incumbent has better \nname identification. Each is given the same radio, TV and \nnewspaper space, but the incumbent still has the advantage.\n    Mr. Jacobs. May I respond?"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Mr. Ehlers. What I am simply pointing out is I am not \nconvinced as to what your motivation is; you are still going to \nhave problems remaining. You may respond.\n    Mr. Jacobs. If I may, I wonder how many people know the \nname Kato Kaelin. He was on the witness stand fairly briefly \nbut everybody in the country knows who he is.\n    The greatest equalizer I can imagine is when the public \ncomes to paying attention after the World Series is over, and \nif both people, the challenger and the incumbent, are on an \nequal measure, the TV, and they both can be seen and judged \nthat way it is a great equalizer.\n    There is another thing, I don't know what makes anybody \nthink the challengers automatically are the ones who are going \nto get a lot of money if you take the strictures off. Clearly, \nthat is not the case.\n    There is an old saying, who pays the fiddler calls the \ntune. If you let the American public pay the fiddler, they will \ncome a lot closer to calling the tune. With all due respect to \nmy friends from tobacco growing areas, how in the world do you \nsuppose tobacco subsidies passed year after year if it weren't \nfor the fact there are two kinds of cigarette packs? Packs and \nPACs.\n    Mr. Kanjorski. May I suggest we are looking at the wrong \nthing again. What we should be looking at is comprehensive \nreform and how to encourage the broadest possible participation \nin the Democratic process, particularly in getting elected to \nCongress. That means challengers have to have an opportunity \nfor access to the voter.\n    How that is attained--we wouldn't be talking about PACs \nhere today if we didn't have private enterprise running our \nlicensed TV stations, because as a matter of fiat, we can issue \nstamps or give candidates time. All of us know that is two-\nthirds of our costs in our districts. Clearly, if we opened up \nthe radio and TV stations for an allotted number of hours to be \nused by candidates at their will, that sounds like a great \nthing for probably 300 of us. But those poor characters in Los \nAngeles, they are never going to get heard. So we know there is \nno way of putting into force the ideal system.\n    We are so diversified and so broad a country. So why try \nand change the private ownership of the airwaves? Why go \nthrough all the machinations? Why not just try and find a way \nthat we can get equality of accessibility for ideas, knowing \nfull well we will not get to perfection?\n    But there isn't any doubt in my mind that the last election \ndid prove something to me, the winners other had less money \nthen the losess. Obviously, issues prevailed.\n    Mr. Ehlers. Mr. Greenwood.\n    Mr. Greenwood. I appreciate that may be a rosier picture \nthan I have drawn, and I don't think you were here for my \ntestimony, Vernon, but PACs tend to give to Members of Congress \nbecause they want Republicans to win or Democrats to win. And \nthere is a certain amount of truth to that. But when I ran \nagainst an entrenched incumbent in 1992, I called PACs who were \nbusiness PACs who always supported Republicans and their \nresponse was, God, we hope you beat him but we have to give our \nmoney to him because he is on the Commerce Committee. That is a \nreality."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    PACs simply went in the direction of whether Republicans or \nDemocrats tend to support their positions. We must assume the \nsubcommittee Chairman must be a super Republican or a super \nDemocrat and the full committee Chairman must be a super-duper \nRepublican or a super-duper Democrat because they sure get a \nlot more money than the average Republican or Democrat. One \nmight be that it has something to do with access, if not \ninfluence.\n    The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired.\n    We can have another round of questioning if we can go \nthrough The first by honoring the clock. I would tell the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania he missed the Speaker's initial \nstatements in which he said he believed that PAC money followed \npower and that you could see the change from Democrats to \nRepublicans.\n    Does my friend from Arizona wish to inquire?"
"pastor","Mr. Pastor","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Yes, Mr. Chairman.\n    It is interesting because I have had the opportunity to \noversee in several countries, mainly Central America, elections \nand there was always the complaint of the minority party or the \nopposition party of the state that the state party always had \nall the perks and benefits. It is interesting, the incumbent \nwill always benefit just by being in office, whether it is \nfranking, or any time that person wants to make a statement, \nthey will get the media, the TV and the radio, to follow them, \nor newspapers will write about them. Incumbency brings with it \nsome status that provides a benefit. I think as much as we want \nto do away with franking and all that, I think we will always \nhave that situation.\n    Maybe things are different where I come from, but at least \nwith the political action committees that I participate with \nthere always has been some type of local presence, meaning that \nif it is the cotton growers, it is the cotton farmers in \nArizona. And in the district I represent, these people are the \nones who basically have to say this is someone that can \nrepresent me well, does represent me well, and I feel that we \ncan endorse him, we will endorse him in his campaign. This \napplies to the unions as well.\n    I have lost support probably from very strong unions \nbecause of my positions, especially on NAFTA. I voted for NAFTA \nbecause my district aligns with Mexico and I felt it was good \nfor the district. So there were local union members who went to \ntheir national boards and said, we are not going to support his \ncampaign.\n    So at least in my situation there has been a local presence \nand also the local people have been able to influence whether \nor not the contributions will come to me.\n    Since I have been in Congress, one of the arguments that I \nhave heard, and it is mainly from Minority Members and in many \ncases women who are our peers here in Congress, is that they \ncome from districts or represent districts that have very \nlittle wealth or very few individuals that can write the checks \nin a number such that they can have effective campaigns. They \nare willing to accept PAC money from those organizations that \nthey are philosophically in tune with. I would like to hear a \nresponse from you gentlemen to that argument. If you want to \nstart with Mr. Jacobs and move down, that is fine. I would like \nto hear your response.\n    Mr. Jacobs. I think you have my answer in my chief \nstatement. If everybody in the country contributes to the \nprocess as in fact "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","pastor","Mr. Pastor","they do to the serving of the process, no private money is allowed in \ncongressional office operations. If you did that, you would \nhave an equalization, and the general public would not only \nhave the opportunity to hear people regardless of whether rich \nor poor, people like them and give them money, but also would \nhave the reassurance that one of the panelists talked about a \nmoment ago. Whether those contributions influenced a person or \nnot, public perception is clearly that they do, and the \npublic--Caesar's wife was a pretty important aspect to all \nthis."
"pastor","Mr. Pastor","pastor","Mr. Pastor","    Yes.\n    Mr. Portman. Mr. Pastor, I think this is an interesting \nissue that has to be dealt with. But I will make a statement \nthat someone who is in a rural district that is poor or poor \nurban district is not running against someone who represents a \nrich suburb, in other words, it is always interesting, I hear \nthe argument, there is never focus on the fact that the \nincumbent's competition faces the same fund-raising challenge.\n    By moving from PACs to more individual contributions, it is \nmy view if done properly you will still have a lot of \nindividuals giving, more giving from that area. You are going \nto have people giving because they believe in the candidate one \nway or the other and you are not going to have the undue \ninfluence, I think. If you look at the facts you have to see \nthat they have given to incumbents, whether Democrats or \nRepublicans, they give to incumbents for access, not because \nthey believe in them.\n    You can argue in the poorer districts you would have better \nrepresentation and you would still have the same level playing \nfield that you don't have now because the PAC money is coming \nin from Washington to a district where there is not resources \nfor that challenger."
"pastor","Mr. Pastor","pastor","Mr. Pastor","    The Speaker earlier talked about another factor \nhe is very concerned with, and some of you, I think, talked \nabout it as well. You have people who have the means, who are \nwealthy, and they go shopping to districts and say, I can win \nhere or there. I will put my money in and I will buy it.\n    Now, this has happened in some districts where people with \nmoney are able to go in there, at least they think they are \nable to go in there and, with their money, buy the election.\n    Mr. Whitfield. I would say if you eliminate PACs, you end \nup with a worse scenario. Because in that situation, people in \nrural districts where it is difficult to raise money anyway, \nare going to become more dependent upon individuals with \nwealth. Those people are going to have more influence on the \ncandidates than if you take PAC money where you generally do \nnot know your contributors except the few workers who live in \nyour district.\n    Mr. Kanjorski. Can I add something to that?\n    The Chairman. Briefly, because the gentleman's time has \nexpired.\n    Mr. Kanjorski. Some of us would like to emulate the English \nsystem but we forget that system nominates the members of \nParliament from a central core. They don't get selected from \nthe constituency.\n    The second thing is, I have to answer that directly, I \nwould not have been able to run for Congress against a sitting \nincumbent "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","pastor","Mr. Pastor","Democrat except I was able to finance the campaign myself. It was \nphysically impossible to raise the kind of money to mount a \ncampaign to get access over TV and radio that is necessary to \nstrike the issues to win a primary.\n    When you talk about minorities and women, certainly very \noften if they don't have great personal wealth, they may be the \nbest candidate in the world, they will just never get out \nthere. On the other hand, you may have a clinker as a Member \nbut he will be the candidate.\n    I go back to what Ms. Dunn said, all of us who have tried \nto solicit candidates, you know how difficult it is at every \nlevel of government because no one wants to run who would \nsurely lose. To have the opportunity to win does take money in \nour position.\n    The Chairman. Does the gentlewoman from Washington wish to \ninquire?\n    Ms. Dunn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do wish to inquire and \nto say a special hello to Paul, whose sister is my precinct \ncommittee officer in my district in Bellevue.\n    Mr. Kanjorski. I am truly bipartisan.\n    Ms. Dunn. That was a good point.\n    The Chairman. His sister hasn't backslid yet? She is still \na Republican?\n    Ms. Dunn. No. She is a Republican.\n    Mr. Jacobs. Glad you said yet.\n    The Chairman. Ever. I stand corrected.\n    Ms. Dunn. We discussed in talking about PAC contributions \nthe pluses, the minuses; we talked about the correlation. I \nthink Mr. Inglis brought up the correlation between incumbency \nand PAC donations.\n    I was interested in Mr. Portman's comments that the Supreme \nCourt has never, really never directly addressed the issue of \nbanning PACs. Is that correct?\n    Mr. Portman. I believe that is correct. If you look at the \nseminal decision, Buckley v. Valeo decision, it does not \naddress it. I would argue by addressing the apparent or real \ncorruption issue, it is a decision that can be used to support \nthe constitutionality of banning at least connected PACs.\n    Ms. Dunn. I think that is very interesting information, Mr. \nChairman, since that is an issue that often comes up, the \nunconstitutionality of limiting a PAC's contribution unless it \nis supported by Federal funding of campaigns. So that is one we \nneed to spend some time going into to get at what is really in \nthere.\n    A couple of issues are intriguing to me. Bundling is one of \nthose. It is a way that organizations are able to direct many, \nmany checks from individuals to contributors. I think that is \nsomething that we have to question as we look into means of \nfunding political campaigns in this Nation.\n    But, Mr. Whitfield, I wanted to ask you a question. I agree \nwith you that one of the major problems in dealing with PACs \nright now is the perception that people at home have that we \nsit back here dialing for dollars, huge contributions, $5,000 \nper election, $10,000 in a two-election cycle, rather than \ngoing back home and talking to our constituents where we should \nbe; that the connection is no "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","pastor","Mr. Pastor","longer there, that we are wooed by these huge donations that PACs are \nable to give.\n    My approach to that is that you equalize PACs with what an \nindividual can contribute which is what you say in your \nproposal, but I would bring the PACs down to $1,000 as the \nindividuals are now.\n    Let me just ask you, how do you--how would you explain to \nthe public, your constituents back home, that you would \nactually be raising the individual limit of these huge major \ndonors to $3,000 as you limit the PACs to $3,000?\n    Mr. Whitfield. First of all, a lot of people in my district \nreally do not know what a PAC is. They think corporate funds \nare involved in PACs, which they are not.\n    But I would simply say that West Vaco, for example, their \nemployees number 2,000 in my district. They have a PAC. They \ncan give $5,000 each. An individual can only give $1,000. So I \nwould simply raise the amount, as you suggested, from $1,000 to \n$3,000, and I would make the argument that $3,000 is a \nreasonable amount for an individual to be able to give as long \nas the PACs cannot give any more than that. I have talked about \nthat a lot throughout my district, and most people really agree \nwith that.\n    I don't think that this money corrupts necessarily. I think \nthat disclosure is the important thing, whether it is bundling \nor whatever it is. We have adequate disclosure laws today so \nthat people are aware of where your money is coming from.\n    Like everybody else, I do not need a Federal law telling me \nthat it is going to be to my benefit to raise as much money in \nindividual contributions in my district as possible. I make an \neffort to do that.\n    Ms. Dunn. Thank you.\n    I think really what we have to do here as we redesign \ncampaign finances, we have to bring the individual into the \nprocess to a much greater degree. Earlier before your panel \nbegan, we talked about how you could use the tax code to do \nthat. For example, giving some sort of credit as we used to do \nto donors of $100 or less money.\n    How in your thinking on this issue, with your bills that \naddress PAC contributions, how would you see that we could \nsuccessfully encourage more people to be involved on the \nfunding end of things? I am looking at anybody on the panel.\n    Mr. Jacobs. I would be glad to answer that.\n    Ms. Dunn. Other than public funding.\n    Mr. Jacobs. By my system. The public is going to be more \ninterested if they can hear a variety of opinions, and if the \nlaw is lobbyist is the gatekeeper to communication, to a \nconsiderable extent they are not going to hear that variety \nbecause some people don't like what the lobbyists want. Some \ncandidates want to talk about something else.\n    If you really got in and had these various points of view, \nI think it would be more attractive to the public. If it is \nmore attractive to the public, the public is more likely to \nparticipate, even if you go with private contributions, more \nlikely to get interested, more likely to go vote, more likely \nto write that $5 or $10 check and undergo the excruciating \nburden of digging down and getting 32 cents and sending it \ndirectly to the campaign of the person the citizen favors."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","pastor","Mr. Pastor","    Mr. Kanjorski. May I suggest, in the tax credit concept \neveryone, other than those people on welfare or the working \npoor that don't pay taxes at all, pays some sort of tax, and if \nyou construct--I give up to $200 tax credits, I did that favor \nof my Republican friends because you have to recognize there \nare more higher donors on the Republican side. It would be more \nwork for the Democrats to raise that money. If you tell people \nyou are taking money paid in taxes to the government and \ndirecting them to the candidate of your choice, it is a hiatus \nuntil you get the three or four months' tax credit between \nelections. That is not making an onerous contribution on the \npart of these people.\n    It would seem to me any reasonable candidate who should \nstand for Congress would have 500 or a thousand people in his \ndistrict that he could go and ask them to stand the interest \nlost for that four, five, six month period until they recoup \nthe money from the Federal Government.\n    Finally, you want a filtering process. The one mistake we \ndon't want to make is publicly finance anybody who runs for \noffice, because I can give you examples in Pennsylvania. We did \nthat in the judicial system and we started to get 30 and 40 \ncandidates running, for only three spots on the Supreme Court \nor Commonwealth court, and the persons who drew the first three \nballot lines won. You can't run issue elections in judicial \nrates like this. So we have to have a filtering mechanism, but \nwe have to have accessibility to funds to buy the private \nsector time and not disturb the TV, radio or newspapers and \nforce them to run political ads or not pay them for it. We are \ntaking on a much larger task than necessary.\n    The Chairman. The gentlewoman's time has expired. I believe \nthe gentleman from Michigan had a question he would like to \nask.\n    Mr. Ehlers. Not a question, simply a comment. It was \nintended for Mr. Jacobs on the first round. I have a comment \nthat concerns your suggestion for free TV. I suspect Abraham \nLincoln would not have been able to be elected if it were based \non TV contests.\n    Mr. Jacobs. That is mainly because they didn't have TV. It \nwas easy to get to all the constituents in those days.\n    Mr. Ehlers. But the other thing, it seems to me the panel \nidentified PACs as a problem and incumbency as a problem. We \ncan solve both in one shot by saying no PACs for incumbents, \nonly for challengers.\n    The Chairman. With that, I would like to thank very much \nthe panel both for your testimony and your willingness to come \nback and begin the process of questioning each other.\n    If there is a vote immediately following this vote, it will \nbe 10 minutes after the last vote.

break,break,break,break,break
"","","pastor","Mr. Pastor","    Ms. Smith of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and other \nmembers of the Committee. This is a great opportunity to \nrestore the American people's confidence in this system. I am \ngoing to summarize my comments and share my time with Mr. \nMeehan and give you my complete statement for submission.\n    It has been clear, listening to the testimony today, that \nthere are a lot of people that agree that special interest \nmoney holds an undue influence on the political process. But I \nthink something I want to tell you is this: I helped run the \ngrassroots organizations in our state. People don't believe \nthey count anymore. They believe special interests counts and \nthey don't. We must change this perception.\n    One way we can do this is by dealing with the influence of \nPolitical Action Committees. Earlier this year, Representative \nBrownback, myself and several freshman reformers, introduced a \nbill that abolished PACs outright. This was the same position \nthat was advocated by Speaker Gingrich last November on the \nMacNeil-Lehrer Report. More recently, I have joined a national \ncoalition with Congressman Shays, Meehan and others and we are \ntestifying before you today on a bipartisan bill, H.R. 2566.\n    This bans PACs and has a fall-back position and we have \ndecided that this is more defensible, but the people want PACs \nremoved. And I would say that again, because I don't believe \nthe American people want a reduction of special interest power. \nThey want an elimination of special interest power.\n    I ask this committee to resist leaving PACs at all, and I \ndo this for a very clear reason. When I got here, I was amazed \nat the evening fund-raisers and that we had to talk about them \nnot affecting us even though we were going between votes. I \nknow that it doesn't affect some of you. You have said that. \nBut it troubles me deeply that the impression is that we are \ntaking money while we are voting and that we are holding fund-\nraisers and getting the money from special interests.\n    We do know for sure that this process does lock some of us \nin here. We can get the money easily. It comes to us. The \nchallenges are at home trying to raise it out of people. It \ngives us a four-to-one advantage in PAC money.\n    Finally, I would like to close with this: We have to have a \nbipartisan solution. History has shown that when you start on \nthis and you come out with a partisan solution, that all you do \nis use it in the campaign year to beat each other up and never \naccomplish anything.\n    I would encourage this committee to adopt a bipartisan \nsolution. We have brought you a bipartisan bill. We would ask \nthat you use it or come up with your own, but please don't wait \nuntil the next "

"","","pastor","Mr. Pastor","campaign cycle and work on campaign reform. Do something strong now.\n    I commend you for taking this very, very difficult issue. \nAnd I give the rest of my time to Representative Meehan."

"","","pastor","Mr. Pastor","    Mr. Meehan. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members \nof the Committee. I want to thank Congresswoman Smith and \nCongressman Chris Shays for allowing me portions of their time. \nWe have been working. Congressman Shays and Congresswoman Smith \nand I have been working together on a bipartisan bill, campaign \nfinance reform bill for some time. It is not a perfect bill, \nbut it represents compromises from both sides of the aisle.\n    Traditionally Democrats have been unwilling to abolish \nPACs. At the same time Republicans traditionally have been \nunwilling to go along with spending limits. The truth of the \nmatter is, if we have real campaign finance reform, we have to \nhave both. Our bill does both, limits the overall expenditures \nto $600,000. It also eliminates PACs. It eliminates bundling. \nIt calls for legitimizing the process of soft money and it \nholds lobbyists contributions in and caps them at $100 per \nelection cycle.\n    You know, we have been talking about campaign finance \nreform on the Hill for a long, long period of time. The cost of \nrunning campaigns is going through the roof and the American \npeople demand action. This bill mirrors the bill--the historic \nbill that was filed in the United States Senate that is picking \nup support every day, Senators McCain and Feingold's bill. It \nalso limits large contributions to 25 percent of the overall \namount.\n    Day in and day out, Members of Congress are being asked to \nmake very difficult choices, choices about how to balance the \nbudgets, choices about what to do about tobacco, and as long as \nwe have a system of campaign finance that requires Members of \nCongress to be raising political money 24 hours a day, 365 days \na year, we are going to have a system that the American public \nisn't going to have confidence in.\n    This bipartisan bill is a bill that I believe both sides of \nthe aisle ought to be able to support. It is extremely \nimportant that we not let this bill die as other bills have in \nconference committee because of the partisanship and the \npartisan nature that the debate has taken in past years. I \nwould hope that this committee would work and look very \nseriously at this bill, not only is it a bipartisan bill, it is \na bicameral bill.\n    We are working with the United States Senate right now to \nget a bill that won't die in conference. Both political parties \nhave been very good with coming up with campaign finance reform \nbills that die in conference. In this Congress, let's make a \ndifference. Let's get a bill that won't die in conference, that \nthe President will sign, that will result in real reform.\n    Thank you."

"","","pastor","Mr. Pastor","    Mr. Smith of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. \nBack in 1979 when I first entered the Michigan legislature, \nmulti-client lobbyists came with envelopes before key votes or \nafter key votes as a very overt means of persuasion.\n    In the United States Congress, that persuasion is much more \nsubtle but just as real in the minds of individual Americans, \nand perception becomes reality. It diminishes the opportunity \nof this body to lead with any legislation that we pass in this \ncountry.\n    Campaign finance reform is very important. Here is my \nsuggestion: You shouldn't leave it up to leadership, the \nSpeaker, task forces or anything else. I would suggest that you \nconsider developing a resolution on how you think we should \nproceed with campaign finance reform, bringing the different \ntask forces and groups into play, and finalize what comes back \nto this committee at a date certain.\n    I appreciate the opportunity to testify. I hope we can move \nahead aggressively on this issue, that I think is as important \nas the question of term limits, in having the respect of the \nAmerican people.\n    I would yield the balance of my time to Peter Torkildsen, \nthe gentleman from Massachusetts."

"","","pastor","Mr. Pastor","    Mr. Torkildsen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the \nCommittee. Because of a time conflict, I will be very brief and \nsubmit a longer statement for the record. I have filed two \nbills dealing with campaign finance reform. The first one is \nthe one I am going to address today. It simply eliminates PAC \ncontributions to House and Senate candidates.\n    I think the time has come for us to take that very bold \nstep. If we can do nothing else, at a minimum we should reduce \ncontributions from PACs from 5,000 to 1,000 per election, but I \nwould hope the committee would take the needed and bold step of \nbanning PAC contributions altogether.\n    If you just look at the statistics, they are staggering. \nFifty-five percent of candidates for the House received more \nthan half their funds from PACs in the last election. Some \nMembers receive over 70 percent of their funds from PACs. 20 \nyears ago, there were only 600 registered PACs. Now there are \nover 4,000. And in the last election cycle, nearly one-third of \nall contributions to House and Senate candidates came from \nPolitical Action Committees.\n    I think when you have individual contributions, people can \nsee those have to be reported. That has to be continued. \nIndividuals should be required to raise money from individuals. \nSo I would hope this committee looking at the broader campaign \nfinance reform package and I have a bill on that--we can \ndiscuss at another time--would include that very important step \nof eliminating PAC contributions.\n    I think that this more than any other step will help \nrestore confidence in how all of us seek election and \nreelection and allow us to really act in the public interest.\n    With that, I would be happy to yield back whatever time I \nhave not consumed."

"","","pastor","Mr. Pastor","    Mr. Wamp. Thank you, Chairman Thomas, for calling us here \nto discuss what I think is one of the most important challenges \nfacing all the Members of the 104th Congress, especially the \nnew Republican Majority.\n    I come here as an expert today in one specific area of \ncampaign finance and that is how you run a campaign without a \ndime of PAC money. I have done it twice, once narrowly losing \nto a long-time incumbent and another time battling through a \ntough primary and a tougher general election, each time \nrefusing to take any PAC money even though my opponents had the \nadvantage of using PAC dollars.\n    My election is proof that it can be done, but that doesn't \nmean that I have lost my commitment to changing our system. \nBeyond the tilt that PACs put in the electoral process, there \nare at least two other evil influences, the perception that our \nelected leaders can be bought and the reality that big money \nspecial interests do in fact affect the process and outcomes in \ngovernment here.\n    Since arriving in Congress this year, I have seen that some \nof our constituents' worst fears may actually be true. Even our \nfreshman class of the 104th Congress, which I consider to be \nthe purest, most worthy group of leaders elected to this body \nin my lifetime, is not immune from the bad influence of PACs. I \nbelieve that PACs are the Achilles' heel of this freshman \nclass' effort to reform business as usual in Washington.\n    I have taken this on as a personal challenge and I ask the \nmembers of this committee to join me to reduce the influence of \nPACs in our election process so that newly elected Members \ndon't have to feel that their first duty of office is to have a \nPAC fund-raiser so that legitimate challengers can still have a \nchance to make our elections competitive, so that special \ninterests don't even think that they can buy votes, and so most \nimportantly of all the people of our country can be assured \nthat their elected representatives represent them and no one \nelse. Our Members deserve to have the public trust, but we will \nenjoy that only when we make real strides to reform the \nelection process.\n    Here is what I propose in my bill, the Wamp Congress Act of \n1995. First, reduce the PAC limit from $5,000 to $2,000 per \nelection, bringing it into line with individual contributions \nby raising the personal limit from $1,000 to $2,000 per \nelection."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","pastor","Mr. Pastor","    Secondly, require that a majority of the candidate's money, \n50 percent plus $1, be raised from individual contributors \nresiding in that candidate's home state. These two simple, \nstraightforward reforms will do wonders to bring the election \nprocess back home, because no longer can a candidate ignore his \nconstituents by holding fund-raisers out of state in \nWashington, D.C. or other financial centers, gaining tremendous \nleverage over the individual contributors back home.\n    The individual limit, as the Speaker said earlier today, \nwas set 21 years ago at $1,000, and if it were indexed for \ninflation would be more than $2,800 today. You can more than \njustify the increase to $2,000. My bill restores some of that \nvalue but, more importantly, makes PACs and individual \ncontributors equal under the law.\n    The majority in-state requirement further limits the \ninfluence of outside special interests by acting as a floating \ncap on what a candidate can raise from outside sources. Every \ndollar must be matched at least one for one from an individual \ncontributor back home.\n    My bill enjoys the support of more cosponsors, 63, than any \nother campaign finance reform measure Congress has considered \nin a number of years. The recent focus that this issue has \nreceived because of the Majority Leader's press conference last \nweek on reform has caused an increased interest in this bill \namong our colleagues. But this support was not late in coming. \nI got 50 cosponsors in the first two weeks my draft was \navailable, and I have spent months talking to my colleagues \nabout this issue from the very first week I got here.\n    I considered at least 17 options for fixing our campaign \nsystem and boiled it down to the two most significant reforms \nthat would both make a difference and build a majority of \nsupport.\n    I applaud the work of Congressman Hoekstra and the \nSpeaker's task force in identifying all the possible options. I \nhave been participating with them very actively. We must move a \ngood bill through Congress and on to the President in the 104th \nCongress. For too long we have not passed any campaign reform \nat all. Yes, we should ban PACs, but let's face it, that is not \nvery likely.\n    I am also a cosponsor of other bills introduced by my \ncolleagues to ban PACs, but we must be realistic. I know that a \nban might not pass a Supreme Court challenge, and I know that \nPAC trying to get a majority of both houses to agree to a PAC \nban may leave us with nothing to show for our efforts.\n    Mr. Chairman, the road to heck was paved with good \nintentions, but good intentions have left us for 21 years with \nnothing to show in campaign finance reform. Let's pass \nsomething this Congress, and I respectfully submit to you, \nChairman Thomas, that my bill has the necessary support to make \nit to the Floor and pass this Congress.\n    With your guidance and the expertise of this committee, I \nbelieve we can make this the best campaign finance reform \nlegislation to come out of Congress.\n    Thank you again for allowing me this time."

"","","pastor","Mr. Pastor","    Mr. Poshard. Mr. Chairman, thank you for allowing me to \nappear before your committee. I will just share an anecdotal \nexperience with you, I guess, with respect to my views on the \nPACs.\n    When I ran my first campaign for Congress eight years ago, \nI went through, I think, the same experience that most freshmen \ngo through. The national party sets you up with meetings out \nhere with the various PACs and special interest groups and you \ncome out and meet with them and ply your wares, so to speak. \nYou either explicitly or implicitly agree with their agenda or \nyou don't agree with it.\n    Many times, in my experience, eight years ago, I don't know \nhow it works today, but they would ask you to sign their \nquestionnaire so that they could come back later and say, well, \nyou know his signature is on this saying he would be one way or \nanother on this particular issue. And I won my election eight \nyears ago and came out here as a freshman and in the course of \nthat campaign season, having gone through the things that I \njust described as most people do, I had made basically my \nstance very clear on a lot of issues.\n    I mean, that is why you get the support from the special \ninterest groups. They don't give you their support, if you tell \nthem you don't agree with their issues. And when you are going \nthrough that initial campaign season, as all of us know, you \nhave a very parochial viewpoint of the world, mainly it is \nformed around your own district and the awareness you have of \nthe issues there and when you get out here, and the bills are \nassigned to your committee, and you listen for six months to \nthe testimonies on a particular issue, that comes from all over \nthis country, from all kinds of professional groups, it is very \npossible that your views on any one given issue may very well \nchange.\n    That happened to me on several occasions, and I found \nmyself going to the Floor of the House time and time again, \nbeing literally torn up inside from the position that I had \nestablished with respect to my interviews with the PACs and the \nspecial interests on their issues and my now changing views \nbecause now I am beginning to see that issue from a broader \nnational perspective.\n    So many times I went to the Floor of the House with a war \ngoing on in my guts. I had given my word. I had even signed \nquestionnaires saying this is where I stand on this issue, and \nby the time "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","pastor","Mr. Pastor","subcommittee and full committee and debate on the Floor ended, I really \nwasn't there anymore. And I remember many times walking over to \nthe Floor of the House with that war going on in my guts \nthinking to myself, now what in the world am I going to do \nhere? I gave these people my word. They gave me their money. \nSome of them gave me five, maybe $10,000, and they didn't have \n50 people in my district. They were national PACs.\n    Am I going to keep my word to them or am I going to make \nthis decision in light of the broader picture now that I have \ncome to believe in as a result of what I have seen here in the \nnational Congress? And you just never got past the battle in \nyour inside.\n    I think that is the influence and it is money that is the \nunderpinning of that commitment. It wasn't that they had so \nmany members back in my district that I feared their votes if I \ndidn't go along with keeping my word. It was the idea that I \nneeded two or $300,000 to run a campaign because I so feared \nsomebody coming out in the last two weeks of my campaign and \nbashing me around with negative advertisement, if I didn't have \nmoney in the bank to respond, I would lose. Money is the \nsecurity blanket. Every one of us here know that.\n    I don't know how we are going to do this, but I know in the \nfirst few months that I was here, I made the decision I did not \nwant to contend with the war any longer, and so I haven't taken \nany PAC monies for seven years. Every year I have sponsored a \nbill to eliminate PACs entirely. I have kept my individual \ncontributions at half of what the law allows, $500, and I have \nnever sent out a newsletter because I believe that is a \nsuperior incumbent advantage that we use politically. So I have \nsponsored legislation from the first time I have been here to \naccomplish those three things.\n    I am glad to be an original cosponsor of the bipartisan \nClean Congress Act. I applaud the Members here at this table \nfor what they have done. But we have a problem here, a problem \nthat impacts upon our ability for independent thought, and I \njust think that the money is overwhelming with respect to its \ninfluence and that we ought to do whatever is necessary to curb \nthat.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman.

break,break,break,break,break
"","","pastor","Mr. Pastor","    Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Members of the \nCommittee.\n    I am going to focus on a bill that I introduced first in \nthe 102d Congress, but let me, just in the way of opinion at \nthe beginning, indicate that I have another set of measures \nthat I personally prefer compared to others that have been \nintroduced.\n    One is a measure that I have introduced that would \nliterally amend the constitution to permit the Congress to set \nFederal campaign spending limits, and also for States and \nlocalities to do that in our various States. I think that is \nthe cleanest way to do it. It is the one I am most comfortable \nwith and then companion legislation that has been sponsored \nhere in the House to, as a condition of granting licenses over \nthe public airwaves, grant candidates free time.\n    Now, that is where I am the most comfortable. I know that \nothers have other measures that try to somehow weave their way \naround the various court cases and so forth, that deal with \ncampaign spending, but I really think this has gotten way out \nof hand, and I think that though I am not one to amend the \nConstitution every other day, I really don't see a cleaner way \nof getting at this problem of putting a lid on spending.\n    I find it incredible that people here are raising ten times \nmore money than the job pays. And it is completely wrong. The \nbill I come before you on today is H.R. 2499, as I mentioned, \noriginally introduced in the 102d Congress. Our office is \nreally not a ``Johnny Come Lately'' to this issue, but I want \nto focus today on the influence of foreign money on our \ncampaigns.\n    As you know, the law does not permit foreign nationals to \ncontribute to U.S. political campaigns. And that includes \nforeign governments, foreign political parties, foreign \ncorporations, foreign associations, foreign partnerships, \nindividuals with foreign citizenship, and immigrants not \npossessing a Green Card.\n    However, every year foreign interests are spending millions \nand millions of dollars to influence our political process. \nThis money comes in the form of PAC contributions from foreign \ncontrolled corporations or their trade associations. Foreign \ncontrolled PACs contributed over $3 million just in the 1992 \ncycle alone, and today in The Washington Post, at least four of \nthose corporations are listed as massive givers of what is \ncalled soft money, Brown & Williams, a tobacco corporation, \nBritish Petroleum, Ciba-Geigy and Glaxo, Incorporated. So this \nis a problem that is not small in nature.\n    The amounts they are giving are well over $250,000 for some \nof the individual ones. The issue of foreign influence on U.S. \nelections is a serious one, and I believe that just as foreign \nnationals are prohibited from contributing to our campaigns, so \nshould PACs that are controlled by foreign corporations and \ntrade associations that they have formed also be barred.\n    Further, our bill recognizes that no coherent system exists \ntoday to track the millions that are currently being spent by \nthese PACs "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","pastor","Mr. Pastor","on the lobbying before this government. The data system that is \navailable is truly disjointed and our bill, which we call the \nEthics in Foreign Lobbying Act, would also make this process \nmore transparent and accountable.\n    It would bar all foreign contributions to U.S. political \ncampaigns, including PAC contributions, and would make the \ndisclosure of related expenditures available and visible at a \ncentral source by establishing a clearinghouse for data that is \ncurrently collected but scattered among various government \nagencies, including the FEC and the Department of Justice.\n    The U.S. is one of the very few countries to allow foreign \ninterests to contribute to campaigns. Most of our major trading \npartners, including Japan, Mexico, China, Thailand, et cetera, \nall strictly prohibit foreign campaign contributions. However, \nbecause of a loophole in the current law, business entities \nthat are organized under U.S. laws and maintain their principal \nplace of business in the United States are not classified as \nforeign principals under Section 611(b) of the Foreign Agents \nRegistration Act, which is the governing act.\n    The result is that currently, American subsidiaries of \nforeign-owned companies or trade associations may operate PACs. \nSome of the names are very familiar to us, including the ones \nthat I have already read, and additionally Toyota, Shell Oil, \nBritish Petroleum, the Bank of Tokyo, etc.--and these interests \nall exert influence on our election process.\n    I believe the current system is a very confusing one \nwhereby it is illegal for foreign nationals to contribute to \nour elections, but foreign-controlled or owned corporations, \nsubsidiaries and trade associations can do so.\n    Our bill would prohibit campaign contributions from PACs \nsponsored by corporations that are more than 50 percent \nforeign-owned, and would prohibit such contributions by trade \nassociations that derive 50 percent or more of their operating \nfunds from foreign corporations, and it would set up a complete \ndata collection and clearinghouse system.\n    The bill requires no new reporting, Mr. Chairman, and \nmembers of the committee, and I thank you for the opportunity \nto testify. I will provide ample materials supportive of this \nposition for the record.\n    Thank you.\n    The Chairman. I thank the gentlewoman. If you are able to \nstick around, I would love to ask some questions during the \nquestion period."

We need to find a way, if we can, to \nvoluntarily limit the amount that is spent. We need to find a \nway to eliminate PAC contributions, particularly leadership \nPACs and the kind of PAC contributions that happen in \nWashington, where Members call up lobbyists and say, ``Will you \nattend my PAC fund-raiser and, by the way, you know, I haven't \nseen you for awhile and I would like to see you there, and I \nknow it has gone up from $200 now to $500, in some cases even \nmore, but I really want to see you there.''\n    We need to find ways to eliminate or reduce the impact of \nsoft money. These are corporations, unions, individuals giving \nunlimited sums to our political parties. There has got to be a \nway to at least cap that kind of expenditure. And I might just \nsay to you that we have got to find a way to eliminate the \nbundling of campaign money. We have done that in a bill that \nhas been introduced by Linda Smith; Marty Meehan, a Democrat; \nDavid Minge, a Democrat; Glenn Poshard, a Democrat; Bob \nEnglish, Republican; and myself, a Republican, bipartisan.\n    We call it the Bipartisan Clean Congress Act of 1995, but \nwe really could call it the bipartisan and bicameral, because \nit is really designed after what John McCain, a Republican from \nArizona, and Russ Feingold, a Democratic, have introduced in \nthe Senate.\n    It looks to limit the amount that we spend on campaigns. It \nlooks to eliminate PACs, eliminate soft money, eliminate \nbundling and, in the end, I think we will have a tremendous \nimpact.\n    I just will finally end by saying I am grateful as well \nthat you are holding this hearing, but that our Speaker came \nand testified and has fulfilled his commitment. He made a very \nsincere pledge with the President of the United States. They \nshook hands on it and it is important that that pledge be \nhonored.\n    I would just add that it be speeded up a bit, that it not \ncome in May, the results of the Commission, but that it come \nsooner, to give us a little more time to deal with this issue \nbefore the summer "

"","","pastor","Mr. Pastor","    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman very much.\n    I was very pleased as well that not only the Speaker but \nthe Minority Leader----\n    Mr. Shays. I should have said that.\nopening of these hearings but, frankly, in the last several \nCongresses, we have come up with campaign finance reform, but \nit has almost always done--it has been done behind closed doors \nand on a partisan basis. We had tried to work in a bipartisan \nway.\n    I have been remiss in not mentioning yet today the name of \na gentleman from Washington who I worked with for more than a \ndecade in trying to resolve various issues and that was Al \nSwift. Both of us entered into that relationship in a very \nhonest way but, frankly, we were overcome by the circumstances \nin which we found ourselves.\n    I am very pleased, therefore, that we started this series \nof hearings off with the Speaker and the Minority Leader both \nurging us to move forward.\n    Mr. Shays. And as Chairman of the Committee.\n    The Chairman. Well, that is a little different. Maybe that \nis why it is being done the way it is being done. I would like \nto think that. Let me just ask a couple of questions before my \ncolleagues do.\n    Marcy Kaptur indicated that she has a series of bills that \nshe is interested in, the ones that give her the most comfort \nare those that directly deal with a constitutional amendment to \nmove around what we consider obstacles in large part based upon \nlegislation passed in 1974, 1976, and with the Supreme Court \ndecision of Buckley v. Valeo.\n    Anyone else here feel uncomfortable trying to move \nlegislatively, for example, to ban Political Action Committees? \nObviously, the highest comfort level would be a constitutional \namendment but, oftentimes, that places the bar so high that you \nmay not be able to achieve it.\n    Any reaction at all in terms of a legislative ability to \nban PACs or is there a First Amendment freedom of association \nand contribution aspect here?\n    Mr. Wamp. Mr. Chairman, I want to say that I commend the \nframers of the bipartisan Clean Congress Act of 1995 for their \nlook-back provision in the event you have a constitutional \nquestion because that is the cure, from my perspective, and I \nsupport that component of their bill. I don't support the \npublic financing component or I would be a cosponsor of their \nbill, but that is a very ingenious way to approach this, and I \nthink if you do ban PACs, make sure we have got a built-in \nlook-back provision so we can fall back to $1,000 in the event \nyou have a constitutional question.\n    Mr. Poshard. Mr. Chairman, with respect to the cases that \nyou just referenced, there is some real honest debate as to \nwhether or not the PACs have been ruled unconstitutional by the \nSupreme Court.\n    The Chairman. No, ruled constitutional.\n    Mr. Poshard. I am sorry?\n    The Chairman. Ruled constitutional. They may not have been \na central focus.\n    Mr. Poshard. Banning PACs, I am sorry."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","pastor","Mr. Pastor","    The Chairman. Correct. I am with you.\n    Mr. Poshard. I think there is a real question as to whether \nor not that banning PACs would be ruled unconstitutional, and I \ncertainly would support Marcy's efforts and others were that \nthe case but, again, this bill does have a fall-back provision \nin it.\n    The Chairman. And the additional discussion would be that \nif, in fact, PACs are constitutional, does coming together \nvoluntarily to contribute money allow you to contribute more \nthan a single individual necessarily as a constitutional right \nas well? And there are a series of questions that I think we \nhave to kind of place in hierarchial relationship and make \ndecisions from that.\n    Marcy, in terms of your foreign corporations, you indicated \nthat PACs were controlled by foreign corporations. By that, I \nassume you mean that because the Federal Election Commission \nand others have indicated that the administrative costs of a \nPAC can be borne by a corporation that it doesn't have to be \npaid for out of the donations collected by that PAC, that that \nis the way in which they are controlled because, basically, we \nare dealing with employees of a corporation who voluntarily \ncome together and contribute their own money, except for the \nadministrative costs that are paid for by the corporation.\n    Ms. Kaptur. I think if you read the bill, Mr. Chairman, the \nkey to our definition goes to the ownership of the parent \nentity, and the way we have defined it in our bill is that a \n``foreign-owned corporation'' means a corporation that is at \nleast 50 percent controlled by persons other than citizens or \nnationals of the United States.\n    The same is true for the trade associations, where it goes \nto the ownership and the amount of money, who is really paying \nfor that entity to be incorporated and operating. Even though \nit may be true that U.S. citizens can contribute here in the \nUnited States to a PAC controlled by one of those corporations, \nthe fact is, those corporations are owned by corporations from \nother lands, individuals from other lands. That is the issue we \nare probing here.\n    The Chairman. So you are focusing on the ownership of the \ncorporation notwithstanding whether the administrative costs \ncome out of the contributions of the individuals or not?\n    Ms. Kaptur. That is correct.\n    The Chairman. I wanted to clarify that.\n    Ms. Kaptur. Because it would be the interest of the foreign \ncorporation, the international markets that would govern its \ninterest in our marketplace.\n    The Chairman. Thank you.\n    Does the gentleman from California wish to inquire?"
"fazio","Mr. Fazio","pastor","Mr. Pastor","    Yes. I am kind of interested to get a reaction \nacross the panel on a couple of things. First of all, I just \nthought for the record, since most of you are interested in in-\nstate or in-district contributions as a way to clean up the \nsystem, the CRS has done an analysis that shows in the 1994 \nelection cycle, using only what they could learn from the FEC, \nthose who donated over $200, the percentage of out-of-state \ncontributions constituted 15 percent of the Senate and 7 \npercent of the House.\n    Now, that does exclude PACs, and the question, of course, \nis where are PACs from? And they are not all from K Street \nbecause I think most of us believe that 90 percent of all the \nPACs we re"

"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","ceive money from at least have people in our district, Teamsters, \nteachers, farmers, you name it. I am sure there are some \ncorporate PACs that don't have much tie to our districts, but \ntheir interests go across the spectrum and they are not only \ninterested in what may apply to one corporation.\n    It means that we would need to go, if you feel that we \nwould have an inadequate amount of money to spend and certainly \nthere are those who think we can barely compete with the rest \nof the marketing that goes on in our society. At the levels we \nspend today, we would need to go to some other sources if PACs \nwere outlawed and we were limited in our individual fund-\nraising to in-district or in-state.\n    How do you feel about, one, the influence of personal \nwealth, which we see increasingly in the Congress? The Speaker \npointed out today that we have three times as many millionaires \nas when--in the House, as when Mr. Thomas and I were elected, \nalong with him.\n    And as an alternative to individual wealth, how do you feel \nabout political parties having more fund-raising capability and \nmore donating capability as would fill in where we have reduced \nthe influence or eliminated the ability to give of other \nentities? How do you see the shifting potential of one sort of \nmoney to another?\n    How would you rank those alternatives in your list of \nacceptable to less-acceptable methods of funding campaigns?\n    Mr. Wamp. I will take that.\n    The Chairman. Why don't we start with Zach and go down the \nline. That is an easy way to organize it.\n    Mr. Wamp. Quickly, on your first point, I would point out \nthat in my bill, which I think you need to address that \nmajority in-state is not just majority, it is majority of your \nmoney has to come from individual contributors from your home \nstate. By definition, PACs can only contribute less than half \nof your money, and I do that on purpose because that \ncombination reduces the influence of PACs.\n    Wealthy contributors is a real problem, and I think you are \nright on target there, and I think you have to address it two \nways. One, that they can't repay themselves but a certain \namount of the money that they loan themselves after the \nelection. It is absurd that multi-millionaires can spend money \nand then turn around and ask the very people that they are \nworking on behalf of in the Congress for the money back to pay \nthemselves back.\n    So we should limit somehow the amount of money that they \ncan repay themselves or even possibly have a provision which I \nhave heard Brian Bilbray recommend, that if an individual \nspends a lot of their own wealth in their election, that as \nsoon as they go above a certain threshold, that other rules \nwould apply to their challenger, so that they can somehow tap \ninto sources to equalize the playing field.\n    But I don't think spending limits is the solution. I think \nthese other options are."

"fazio","Mr. Fazio","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Marcy.\n    Ms. Kaptur. Yes, Congressman Fazio. I have a great \nprejudice against personal wealth being used in political \ncampaigns, certainly campaigns for Congress, and would seek to \nhave the lowest dollar amount possible imposed. That is why I \nlike the idea of the constitutional amendment where we first \nfix a ceiling and, hopefully, the individual then could be \nlimited to whatever the maximum amount would be.\n    Let us say it is $250 that would ultimately be established \nin that system. But I remember in my first race, my opponent \nraised more money, I think, in the first two months than our \nentire family and all of our relatives were worth, but he could \nhold one fund-raiser and in one evening raise $40,000.\n    It took us six months, through very small donor events, to \neven come close to that. So I understood what we were up \nagainst. And I think that is unfair. It advantages those who \nhave a lot. This isn't a plutocracy or an oligarchy. This is a \ncountry where we want people to run on the basis of their \nideas. So if some of that money could be donated to political \nparties, I have no problem with that as a way of screening \ncandidates and helping people learn a little bit about voter \nregistration, what it is really like to run in campaigns.\n    But I have a strong objection to the kind of self-funding \nthat we see, by the way, operating at the presidential level \nnow, even in New Hampshire, when you see who can buy television \ntime and who can't, just because you happen to have been \nespecially blessed with wealth, you are more valuable than the \npeople who have spent their lives serving their communities and \nserving their states? So I think that we have to severely limit \nthe amount of self-funding that can go on.\n    The Chairman. Linda.\n    Ms. Smith of Washington. When the Chair runs out, it is \nstill okay, right?\n    The Chairman. No, no, we will finish the question. I think \nit is a worthwhile one.\n    Ms. Smith of Washington. I was just teasing you.\n    This was real hard for me because I ran campaign reform in \nthe State of Washington and I actually ran an initiative with \nthe title that said, there will not be spending limits or \npublic funding and won with that title, three to one.\n    I have always been against spending limits and yet I have \nalways been troubled with the fact that people can walk in more \nand "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","more and buy an election. So I collided with myself this year working \nwith the bipartisan group, and the reason the bipartisan bill \nhas become the bill that I am helping with is that it does deal \nwith the wealthy in a responsible way, in voluntary limits, and \nit does not use public funding. And that was important to me \nbecause I don't support public funding.\n    What it does, though, is it says, you sign in to an \nagreement and there will be an embarrassment factor if you \ndon't. That is editorializing. But you sign in to an agreement, \nand as long as the limits are high enough, which they are in \nthis bill at $600,000 in the House, you end up inhibiting a \nwealthy person from buying the election.\n    This says you can use up to 10 percent of your own money \nand, if you do not buy in, you have consequences. When you buy \nin, you do have discounted media.\n    Now, that was a little hard for me, too, but discounted is \nquite different than mandatory or government paid. And we \nbelieve under Buckley v. Valeo that will give us reasonable \nlimits, balanced by an elimination of PACs, an elimination of \nspecial interest PACs here having their lobbyists become \nindividuals, the individual lobbyists getting $400,000 and \nspending half in individual donations and ending up with the \nsame problem we have now, large contributions.\n    So this should work for the wealthy; voluntarily, yes; not \nas tight as what Marcy says, but I would love to run against a \nwealthy person that refused to sign a reasonable agreement when \nwe have that now as a part of a law.\n    So I think it is time that we deal with the issue of wealth \nbuying elections.\n    Mr. Shays. I am told that 25 percent of the Senate are \nmillionaires and 14 percent in the House and that is a pretty \nalarming figure. That is certainly not representative of what \nthe makeup of our country is.\n    To me, the biggest challenge with Political Action \nCommittees is that lobbyists use them in their attendance at \nfund-raisers down here, and I think getting rid of PACs ends \nthat, what I think is the pretty obscene process of Members of \nCongress inviting the lobbyists to contribute to their \ncampaign. Maybe I am overstating the obscene part, but it just \ncauses me concern.\n    In terms of Mr. Fazio, your comment about political \nparties, soft money has become an addiction to political \nparties. I mean, a corporation can literally give $100,000, \n$200,000. The largest and most successful campaign--excuse me, \ncasino in the country, in my state, has given $400,000 to the \npolitical parties. It shouldn't--you know, I don't think we \nneed to be rocket scientists to understand what that means and \nwhy it is happening. So I think that our parties need campaign \ncontributions, but they shouldn't be so dependent on the soft \nmoney and you need to get at the soft money problem.\n    And I would just say----"
"fazio","Mr. Fazio","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Chris, can I interrupt at this point?\n    Mr. Shays. Sure."
"fazio","Mr. Fazio","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    My intent was not to deal with soft money \nalthough it is a very important issue. It is to say how much \nmore should you "

In other words, are we \ninterested in strengthening parties?\n    Mr. Shays.

"fazio","Mr. Fazio","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    They really can't pass it on to the candidate, \nbut it does provide more of their overhead, thereby freeing up \nmoney to give to the candidate.\n    Mr. Shays. I should have said it that way. It covers all \ntheir other costs and then they should just dedicate the rest \nof it to people. But I do think the political parties should \nhave some money to share with candidates that are important to \nthat political party. I think that has to fit in your mix.\n    I just want to express, again, my conviction that a \nvoluntary limit on campaigns done in the way the bicameral and \nbipartisan reform group has done, has tremendous merit, because \nif I run against somebody wealthy, I sign up for that $600,000 \nrequirement, I am able to get media at a discount.\n    I am able to get free mailings to my district at the lowest \ncost. My opponent who then goes above the limit is not able to \nget that benefit, but then we have a provision in our bill that \nallows us to spend 50 percent more to go to $1.2 million--\nexcuse me, to go an additional $300,000, to go to $900,000.\n    The Chairman. Just let me, because I may be remiss if I do \nnot say it, Chris, in the 103d Congress, the Republican \nconference had a campaign finance reform bill in which we \nprohibited any soft money. We said any money not raised under \nFederal campaign rules could not be used to influence, not just \ngive directly to candidates, but to influence Federal \nelections. It was a very controversial, very difficult \nposition, but in discussing with the national committee and \nothers, we felt very strongly and your position was well \nrepresented.\n    Mr. Shays. Could I just comment?\n    The Chairman. If you will recall, the Republican Conference \nwent against soft money.\n    Mr. Shays. But the key will be now that we are in power.\n    The Chairman. I understand that, and that was nice \ngroundwork."
"fazio","Mr. Fazio","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    If the Chairman would just briefly yield, you \nknow the Democratic bill also did away with soft money. That, \nof course, didn't come to fruition either.\n    The Chairman. Was that the one President Bush vetoed or the \none that----"

And then just finally, just to give you an \nidea that we have read the bills, I have some concern in terms \nof your third-class mailing availability and the way in which \nit is funded because, basically, as I understand the bill, and \ncorrect me if I am "

"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","wrong, it says that the post office is supposed to absorb the cost. And \npreliminary estimates from the post office are in the \nneighborhood of 40 to 60 million.

I understand the way in which bills go \ntogether but, as we move through the process, I think we have \nto be more up front in terms of how we provide various benefits \nand just to show you.\n    Mr. Shays. Can I comment on that?\n    The Chairman. Just to show you how I have been thinking \nabout it, because I have advocated this in the past and it is \nnothing new, we already have incumbents who have money \navailable for mailings and it is possible that we might--and \nthat is already covered in terms of taxpayers' dollars--we \nmight figure out a way to share in, any bona fide primary \nopponent to share in the franking costs that incumbents already \nhave built into the system. That would be no new dollars to the \nsystem.\n    Ms. Smith of Washington. Yes, I like that.\n    The Chairman. For instance?\n    Ms. Smith of Washington. I just like it. You are going to \ntake some of our franking and give it to our opponents.\n    The Chairman. Any qualified primary opponent would be able \nto share in the funds available already paid for by taxpayers \nfor informing voters. That is no new money.\n    Mr. Shays. What I would----\n    The Chairman. Radical, but no new money.\n    Ms. Smith of Washington. Not radical.\n    Mr. Shays. But what is exciting is you are thinking about \nthese issues and I think it is very important. I just make the \npoint to you that the rate that would be provided to a \ncandidate would be the rate that we provide for the cheapest \nnonprofit. So it is not something that we don't give other \ncitizens in this country. I just want to make that point.\n    The Chairman. I understand, but it is a cost in the bill \nabsorbed by the post office.\n    Mr. Shays. Definitely a cost, clearly.\n    The Chairman. Does the gentleman from Michigan wish to \ninquire?\n    Mr. Ehlers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Most of those I wish \nto question have left the room, perhaps wisely, but perhaps we \nalso can't consider their bills then.\n    As president of the sophomore class, I do have to take \nissue with the gentleman from Tennessee when he describes the \nnew freshman class as the purest and best class elected during \nhis lifetime. I think we should set the record straight on \nthat.\n    The Chairman. Would the gentleman yield?\n    Some of us don't remember which class we were in but we \ntake offense as well because we think ours was best, whichever \none it was.\n    Mr. Ehlers. Correct. I do have one question for the \ngentleman from Tennessee, and that is you described at some \nlength why you thought PACs are not good, almost evil, and yet \nyou continue them in your bill. You simply reduce the limits."

But I \ntell you this, I don't want to go one more Congress without \ndoing something on campaign finance reform. It has been 21 \nyears while we have been trying to--you know, some people are \npure and want them banned and some people don't want anything.\n    You can't get 218 people and 51 people in the Senate to \nagree on anything.

"pastor","Mr. Pastor","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Mr. Chairman, this is not really a question. It \nis interesting sitting here most of the day listening to \nvarious ideas, and I want to thank all of you for sharing your \nthoughts and your ideas. We started with the Speaker and went \nwith the Leader and a number of panels, and one of the comments \nthat stuck in my mind, from the Speaker, was that this is not a \nnew problem.\n    Financing of campaigns and reforming campaigns has been \ngoing on for many years. In fact, Political Action Committees \nin the 1970s were an answer, in the sense of reform, so that \nindividuals could form these committees and they would not have \nthe problem of individuals, wealthy individuals, dictating \ncampaigns.\n    But it is interesting because some people want to get rid \nof PACs because, like Mr. Ehlers stated, they could influence \nthe winner of an election. Then they influence the person, once \nthey are in Congress, and give an unfair advantage to \nincumbents. So there are many reasons why we feel as we do \nabout Political Action Committees.\n    It is interesting because we had one panelist talk about \ntotal public financing, that the route to go is total public \nfinancing. That way you don't have to worry about any \ninfluence. Anyone who qualifies would have access to TV, radio, \net cetera.\n    Earlier I asked the question, do you have any problems with \nunlimited donations by individuals, only that disclosure be \nimmediate and frequent. So there is a whole spectrum of ideas. \nBut I would agree with you that we need to look at campaign \nreform, lobbying reform and all of them together, to see what \nwe can do to ensure that the image of elected officials is a \nlittle better than it has been in the past.\n    So I look forward to working with you in a bipartisan \nfashion to see what is practical and what will--what can--solve \nthe many in"

Your vision, \nyour credibility, the work we did on the Contract, make you a \ngreat headliner for this issue because you are absolutely \nright, we must take action.\n    This morning the Speaker promised us that by the end of \nthis session, we would have a bill. It is very important for us \nto move forward knowing that is the deadline. I believe every \nsingle one of us wants to accomplish this, certainly because of \nthe difficulty in the number of important changes that we must \nmake in government right now. It can't be the top item on the \nagenda and wasn't at the beginning of this year, but should be \nbetween now and the time we finish.\n    Ms. Kaptur, it is always good to hear from you. You are \nvery thoughtful and I am very much interested in what you are \nproposing and will be interested to see what the Judiciary \nCommittee says on your constitutional amendment.\n    But I am going to take special consideration here, Mr. \nChairman, if I may, because we have a person from my home State \nof Washington who has done a lot of work in campaign finance \nreform. She was, in fact, part of a very effective team in the \nState of Washington that began in 1991 to write an initiative \nto qualify it for the ballot, to send it to the legislature and \nthen, in 1992, to pass campaign finance reform in our State of \nWashington. So I would simply like to ask our Congresswoman, \nLinda Smith, to give us a review.\n    How do you think it is working, Initiative 134, and should \nwe have done anything different on this issue, Linda? Are you \npleased with the results?\n    Ms. Smith of Washington. That is pretty broad, but I \nappreciate the question because often when you start something \nyou want to know if it is going to work. We are now three years \ninto com"

"","","pastor","Mr. Pastor","prehensive reform and we started in the 1980s drafting it and the \ncoalition had Common Cause in it. It had some of the other \ngroups, and very diverse conservative and liberal groups with \nthe same goal, and that was to take the money out of the \nprocess in Olympia.\n    We started, first of all, Olympia being our capital, with \neliminating fund-raising at the source. So we can no longer \nraise money from any source while we are voting. Now, we only \nvote half a year--but the emphasis was to take the money away \nfrom the voting process.\n    It has been very effective in a lot of ways. The confidence \nlevel, the sleaze factor, the bad reports that we got are just \nnot--they have not been for a couple of years. We then debated \nwhether we would eliminate PACs or limit them. I wish we had \neliminated them. I think now, looking at Buckley v. Valeo after \n20 some years, we could have. We have upheld--been through one \nSupreme Court case and won.\n    But we did leave $500 involvement over a four-year Senate \nrace, and so a group can do that. We eliminate what they can do \nin the month of the election to very, very little, and we \nstopped the transfer of money between candidates and the buying \nof leadership. We abolished leadership PACs and said, if you \nget the money, you have to use it for yourself.\n    What that ended up doing was something we call now term \nlimits. The old-timers that didn't like that very well, because \nthey couldn't sit there and let the money come to them, didn't \nrun. We ended up having a flip of 60 some percent to 30 some \npercent. We nearly had 50 percent new members in the full \nelection cycle.\n    The voter turnout went up substantially more than it had \never been and the involvement of the citizens' groups and the \nindividuals went up. So what we saw was a one-third drop in the \noverall spending. The incumbents had more trouble getting the \nmoney. Challengers had greater ability. We had more start-up \ncampaigns than we had in the history of our State and \ngrassroots politics took over.\n    So I guess what I am going to say is it has worked. The \nthird that came out, came out of the top 15 giving groups, you \nall know what they are. They are the same ones here. And when \nit dropped out, it did drop out of incumbents.\n    And the reason we had so much trouble running it was \nincumbents were getting that money and they would never pass \nanything. When we finally took it out of the legislature to the \npeople, they passed it three to one and, yes, the money dropped \nout of incumbents, but challengers had a greater chance.\n    And I think, Jennifer, that it is working. The only ones \nthat don't like it are the biggest ones. The rest of the \nlobbyists like it now. Most of the groups like it now because \nthey can compete. Before, if you were not at the top of the \npile, you could never get enough money to compete and so the \nolder lobbyists that even fought it now seem to like it. The \nold incumbents, I will tell you, though, the older the \nincumbent, they either dropped out or still don't like it \nbecause they have to go raise money from people.\n    Thank you, Jennifer.\n    Ms. Dunn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I see my time has run \nout."

"","","pastor","Mr. Pastor","    The Chairman. Thank you. I thank all of you. This is the \nfirst hearing on campaign finance reform.\n    The gentleman from Connecticut.\n    Mr. Shays. If I could just say for the record, that my \nstaff has reminded me that the bill that we introduced--that \nwhat we have is H.R. 2566 includes a provision that any savings \nof unfranked mail would go to pay, in part, for the costs, and \nit also bans unfranked--unsolicited franked mail in the \nelection year.\n    And I also just want to say I didn't notice Mr. Pastor when \nwe started out. I just appreciate his interest in this bill. I \naddressed everyone else. I didn't see you tucked away in that \ncorner.\n    The Chairman. I think there has been an unusually high \ninterest in campaign finance reform in this Committee. It is \njust that all of us have schedules to keep, and I appreciate \nyou folks staying when today's Floor session has already ended.\n    And what I was saying was that this is the first in a \nseries of hearings on campaign finance reform. We will have \nanother one on November 16th, beginning at 10:00 a.m., which \nwill be dealing with PACs.\n    The Members who appeared today have legislation. They are \ninterested in change. There are a number of Members who think \nthe current system works okay and they are not here because \nthey don't have bills for change. We will have other Members on \nNovember 16th and we ask practitioners, those who actually \ninvolve themselves in the PAC structure, to come and testify in \nfront of the committee, which probably will be the other side \nof the story, because what we want to do is inform ourselves in \nall of the aspects of how our current system is working.\n    I think one of the problems in the past has been that we \nhadn't fully appreciated what we did before we started trying \nto change it and it produced unintended circumstances which \nthen required us to go ahead and make additional changes and we \nhave been chasing the changes.\n    What we are going to try to do is to get as much broad-\nbased information as possible so, when we move forward, we try \nto educate as well everyone about the consequences of the \nchanges. I want to thank you very much for your participation \nin this committee and I will probably be seeing some of you in \nadditional hearings as we move on to other subject matters as \nwell. Thank you all.\n    This hearing is adjourned."

William M. Thomas \n    Present: Representatives Thomas, Dunn, Ney, Fazio, and \nHoyer.\n    Staff present: Stacy Carlson, Staff Director; Roman Buhler, \nCounsel; Jim Sivesind, Counsel; Chris Wright, Professional \nStaff; Samantha Kemp, Committee Clerk; Janet Guiliani, Staff \nAssistant; and Laura Buhl, Staff Assistant.\n    The Chairman. The Committee on House Oversight will come to \norder. This is the second hearing in a series of hearings on \ncampaign finance reform.\n    As you recall, at the first hearing the Speaker of the \nHouse and the Minority Leader both gave us a broad perspective \nof campaign finance; perhaps far broader than most people \nnormally associate with campaign finance.\n    They went to the heart of the political process and \ndiscussed power. I had said at the first hearing that a \ndefinition of politics that I think is very useful is an old \none. It is the process of determining who gets what, when and \nhow. Power in that context is who are those who help determine \nwho gets what, when and how.\n    Unfortunately, in this process oftentimes individual's or \ngroup's political power is enhanced if other individual's or \ngroup's political power is diminished. It sometimes tends to be \na relative power struggle.\n    When we look at the period from the time the campaign \nfinance laws that are currently in effect were initially passed \nand amended, it roughly corresponds to the period that the \nChairman and the Ranking Member from California have been \nactively involved in elective politics.\n    We both were elected to the Assembly in the State of \nCalifornia in the 1974-1975 period. I preceded the gentleman by \na matter of a few months. We both came to Congress at the same \ntime. That was the period when the current campaign finance \nlaws were passed and put into shape.\n    It also roughly corresponds with the era, if you will, \nsometimes called the PAC era, the growth of PACs. There is a \nchart there which I think fairly graphically illustrates why \nyou could rightfully identify the period from the mid-1970s to \ntoday as the period of the growth of PACs."

"","","pastor","Mr. Pastor","    The Chairman. PACs, as we heard earlier in testimony and I \nam sure we will hear today, have been around for a long time, \noftentimes focused on one of the original political action \nCommittees, the Committee on Political Education or COPE of the \nAFL-CIO. But it wasn't until the 1970s, with legislation, court \ndecisions, and subsequent rulings by the Federal Election \nCommission that you got this enormous growth of the PACs.\n    Beginning in the early 1970s, with less than 1,000 PACs and \npeaking out at around 4,000 total PACs--there hasn't been a \ncontinuous growth of new PACs, they have been ebbing and \nflowing, but a continuation in number. The chart shows the \ndollar amounts contributed by the political action Committees.\n    It is interesting; if you take the number of PACs and the \ndollar amounts that are contributed and simply divide one into \nthe other, which would give you the average dollars contributed \nper PAC, if you look at the 1974 period, the average amount is \n$57,000. These are figures not adjusted for inflation.\n    If you look at the 1994 number of PACs and dollar amounts \ncontributed, it turns out to be $45,000. In 1974, the average \nPAC gave $57,000, not adjusted for inflation. In 1994, the \naverage PAC contributed about $45,000.\n    Most of the focus has been on what happens in terms of \nelections, and the impact of PACs in electing people to office. \nAt the same time you had the growth of the PAC era, you had \nlegislation passed which redefined political parties.\n    While PACs have gone from 600 to over 4,000, during the \nsame period you had two major political parties, the Republican \nParty and the Democratic Party. The 1970s legislation limited, \nwith minor inflationary adjustments, the amount that the two \nparties and other minor parties could contribute to the \npolitical process. A multiplication of the number of PACs, was \nin essence natural response to a political limitation on the \nnumber of political petitions.\n    At the same time in the 1970s, the legislation capped the \namount of money that individuals could contribute, $1000 in the \n1970s, $1000 today. Today's $1,000 is roughly equivalent to \nabout $325.\n    But when you listen to the debate over PACs--and I am going \nto let the witnesses talk about what they like or dislike about \nPACs, that is the purpose of the hearing--it basically runs the \ngamut from a position that PACs as a concept will destroy \nAmerican democracy as we know it, to a position that PACs are \nthe very epitome of the American democratic process. I think it \nhas to do with the perspective from which you view power. If \npolitics is who gets what, when and how, then an important \nconsideration is where are you relative to others?\n    When you talk about campaigns and you look at PACs, the \nimmediate association is with incumbents. Indeed, as the \nSpeaker said, it has been a slightly different world since \nRepublicans have become a Majority. PACs in fact are interested \nin the decision-making process, not so much in who makes those \ndecisions. So naturally, since incumbents are already in \noffice, the argument is that the PAC dollars flow to \nincumbents.\n    A better way of looking at that chart, because when you \nlook at it initially you see bars, but when you do it in a line \ngraph, I think it becomes far more interesting. The solid line \nis a representation "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","pastor","Mr. Pastor","of the bar graph over the same period of the amount of money \ncontributed by PACs to incumbents. The broken line is the \namount of money contributed to incumbents by individuals.\n    For those who might argue that we are in an era of ever-\nincreasing control going to the PACs, if in fact contributions \nof money are defined as power, then I think you have seen a \nperiod in which PACs perhaps had the upper hand. But obviously \nthe flow of money it is changing, and this is to incumbents.\n    When you examine it in the larger context of all \ncandidates, both incumbents and nonincumbents, you get a chart \nwhich looks like that chart. Once again, when you see bar \ncharts like that you react to the numbers and you say okay. But \nwhen you turn it into a line graph, I think it does give you a \nbetter perspective on the political process. This chart \nrepresents all contributions to candidates, incumbents and \nnonincumbents.\n    The solid line represents political action Committees. The \nbroken line represents individuals. Indeed, there was a period \nwhere you saw PACs moving in the direction of being the primary \ncontributors to the political process. That is a historical \nperiod and the trend lines, if you carry the amount, will \ncontinue to move us away from that historical period.\n    Notwithstanding the ebb and flow of political dollars, and \nnotwithstanding the absolute limit both legislatively and \npolitically on the number of political parties--and the reason \nis of course it is a mutually exclusive game with political \nparties, you either belong to the Democratic Party or you \nbelong to the Republican Party--you can't belong to both--and \nas you multiply parties in our system, there is a natural \nstructure which compresses them back to the two major parties.\n    If you look at the history of political parties in our \ncountry, it hasn't always been the same two, but for a long \ntime and for reasons perhaps we will examine in later hearings \nfocusing on political parties, there are trends and structures \nin the system which I think will basically define the two \npolitical parties for a long time.\n    During that same period the amount that individuals can \ncontribute has been capped. The growth of PACs has been \nprimarily over the multiplication of the number of PACs and \nthat clearly we have seen the beginning of the tip; that is, \nprobably as many PACs as probably are going to be formed are \nformed.\n    And with that as simply a factual background of the recent \nperiod known as the rise of PACs and the dollar amounts \nassociated with PACs, I yield to my friend and colleague, the \ngentleman from California."
"fazio","Mr. Fazio","pastor","Mr. Pastor","    First of all, Mr. Chairman, I want to tell you \nhow much I enjoy Professor Thomas' tutorials. They are \nenlightening and I think legitimately break through a lot of \nthe rather simplistic nostrums that float around as relates to \nwhat is wrong with this system and how we might fix it.\n    I would want to underscore the point that individual money, \nhowever it may be perceived to be free of special interest \nbias, in my experience, is far from that. That doesn't mean \nthat there aren't a lot of people who give simply out of party \nloyalty or ideological commitment, but as you go up the scale \nof dollars in $25 to $250 to $2,000 per primary in general per \nfamily, you find in"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","creasing interests that co-lie more with PAC giving than with civil \nvirtue and support for political campaigns.\n    So I hope as we enter into the fray of campaign reform, we \nare willing to for a moment abandon some of our firmest \npositions and try to understand the environment we are truly \nin.\n    As was said at the first set of hearings, there are \nproblems with the political system, not just the campaign \nfinance system. While I think we agree there are problems, the \ndegree to which we share commonality of solution has eluded \nCongress, and I think general opinion.\n    So I would thank the Chairman once again for convening \nthese hearings. I think today we move not only to hear the \ndiversity of views from our colleagues but we move on to hear \nfrom people active in the political environment both \nprofessionally and in terms of their citizen participation, and \nit will help us to understand the complexity of the problem and \nsome of the pluses and minuses of various solutions that have \nbeen offered, and I truly believe that if we are honest and \nthorough in who presents information to this Committee, it will \nhelp us come up with something that might be conducive to \nbipartisan, at least broad political acceptance.\n    I thank the Chairman.\n    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman.\n    The first panel today is, and I don't mean this in any \nderogatory way, represents in part of a spillover from the \nfirst hearing because it was a hearing from Members of Congress \nhaving gone through the process and their view on the way in \nwhich the process might be modified. It is also useful for us \nto start today's hearing off with what I think is a relatively \nrepresentative smorgasbord of approaches to the questions of \nPACs.\n    So if you will allow me, gentlemen, we will begin on my \nright, your left, with the gentlewoman from New York, Mrs. \nMaloney."

"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","<DOC>\nSTATEMENT OF HON."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Mrs. Maloney. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for \ncalling this hearing.\n    I would like to thank my good friend, Mr. Fazio.\n    First of all, I am not new to the issue of campaign finance \nreform. As a Member of the New York City Council, I authored \nthe campaign finance law which was called by the New York \nPublic Interest Group, ``The finest in the Nation.''\n    In my freshman year in the 103d Congress, I served as \nCochair of the Freshman Task Force on Campaign Finance, on \nCongressman Gephardt's Task Force on Campaign Finance, which \noffered and passed H.R. 3. And I am working with Congressman \nFazio on a Democratic Task Force for Campaign Finance Reform.\n    First, I would like to address the idea of establishing an \nindependent commission to write campaign finance reform \nlegislation. I support this idea, and in fact introduced a bill \nMarch 1, 1995, calling for an independent commission.\n    You have before you a packet of material that includes a \nletter from the President endorsing the concept and mentioning \nmy bill. This bill was patterned after the Base Closing \nCommission bill, a problem similar to campaign finance."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    We all agreed that something had to be done but we couldn't \nagree on how to do it. If Congressman Armey never does another \nthing, he contributed a great deal toward solving a problem in \nthis Nation by putting forward the commission idea. It has \noutlined the specifics, and it would come back to the House for \nan up or down vote and we would have a vote and move forward \nhopefully on campaign finance.\n    I differ with the Speaker's suggestion that it needs a two-\nthirds majority. I think it should have a simple majority, like \nCongressman Armey's bill.\n    One of the problems with campaign finance is that it will \nmake it more difficult for incumbents to be reelected; \ntherefore it is very difficult to have incumbents vote on a \nbill and put forth a measure.\n    It appears there is not a great deal of support for a \ncommission idea. Several other bills have been put forward--the \nSmith-Meehan-Shays bill is a very thoughtful proposal and \nCongressman Farr has put forward what was the Gejdenson bill, \nwhich has a great deal of support and has passed this body \nbefore.\n    I am working on my own proposal and would like to testify \nabout certain ideas in my proposal that differ from other \nlegislation that is being considered.\n    First of all, since what we want to do is limit the \ninfluence of special interests and money in the political \nprocess, I propose that we confront Buckley v. Valeo head on \nand put forward a bill that has a spending limit of $600,000 \nper election cycle and let the courts decide. If they decide \nthat it is unconstitutional to have a spending limit, then fall \nback to a voluntary spending limit. But that decision is two \ndecades old and things have changed dramatically.\n    Many constitutional scholars believe that a spending limit \nwould win if we were to get to the Supreme Court with one. In \nthe Buckley v. Valeo decision, the Court said that all \nmeaningful political communication must be paid for. It did not \ntake into account free media or the tremendous influence of \nindependent expenditures that in many cases decide elections.\n    The court said that independent expenditures don't work if \nthey are not connected to campaigns. We all know that that is \nnot true. There are many examples, such as the Willy Horton \nexample and many others that, in some cases, the independent \nexpenditures have decided elections. So I think that it is time \nthat if what we want to do is to influence the amount of money \nin the political process, let's confront Buckley v. Valeo, \nlet's go to the Supreme Court; as Speaker Steingetz from the \nNew York State Assembly used to say, ``Decide what you think is \nright and then let the courts decide.''\n    We are addressing PACs today. I would like to talk about \nthat. I have my own proposal of how the PACs should be \nreformed. Some say that PACs are the bad guys. I say that money \nis. Money is money, whether from a PAC or from an individual.\n    For example, my own campaign I raised a million dollars, my \nopponent raised a million dollars. I accepted PAC \ncontributions. My opponent did not. My opponent severely \ncriticized me for accepting PAC contributions from unions. Yet \nhe would accept a check from executives in the same entity."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    So I ask you, why is an executive's check more meaningful \nthan a number of union workers who come together, pool their \nresources and make a contribution.\n    Another graphic example is law firms. He attacked me for \ntaking a contribution from a PAC in a law firm; yet from other \nlaw firms he would go to them and literally get $20,000 in \nindividual contributions. So I suggest that we have a $500 \nlimit per election for PACs. I am also proposing that we create \na new type of PAC, a citizen Committee of small donors that \nwould contribute $25 or less, and that this small donor or \ncitizen Committee PAC could contribute up to $1,000 per \nelection.\n    I also feel that you need to be able to lift the spending \nlimit, the voluntary spending limit if your opponent does not \nopt in in order to level the playing field.\n    The Chairman. I must tell the gentlewoman, your time has \nexpired. You can go ahead and wrap up. If we have an unlimited \ntime for each Member, Vic and I are going to get old here.\n    Please go ahead but focus on the key points. Basically, I \nam telling the other Members that since you went first, you get \nthe privilege.\n    Mrs. Maloney. I also think that we should ban contributions \nfrom current lobbyists and limit contributions from individuals \nto 75 percent in your home State.\n    I would like to close with a statement from one of my \nconstituents. This past weekend, I was at a meeting of business \nleaders in my district and one executive questioned whether \ncampaign finance reform was really a serious concern of the \nAmerican people. He insisted that reducing taxes was far more \nimportant to this particular group of people. But the way \ncampaigns are financed has a lot to do with reducing taxes.\n    The American taxpayer will have to cough up half a trillion \ndollars for the S&L bailout. The S&L crisis was caused by \nreckless deregulation of the S&L's adopted by many Members of \nCongress whose campaigns were financed by S&Ls.\n    Now, the American taxpayer is picking up the whopping tab. \nLast fall, the voters issued a mandate for change, a mandate \nfor us in Congress to do more and protect our chances for \nreelection.\n    Mr. Chairman, I hope that they did not vote in vain and \nthat you will move forward with a bipartisan campaign finance \nreform.\n    The Chairman. Thank you."

"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Mr. Lewis. Thank you for the opportunity to come before you \ntoday.\n    The challenge and task that you are undertaking is \nformidable. Changing the way campaigns are financed is a \ndifficult job, particularly because it is something that will \ndramatically impact all of our lives. But clearly something \nmust be done. Too much time is spent raising money and the \ncurrent system is one is that has been criticized about the way \nour democracy works.\n    I commend you for holding these hearing and hope you can \narrive at a formula which is fair, nonpartisan and \nnondiscriminatory and restores the American peoples faith in \nour democracy.\n    In 1986, when I first decided to leave the Atlantic City \nCouncil and seek the open seat in Georgia's Fifth Congressional \nDistrict, I was a grass-roots candidate. My background within \nthe civil rights movement and my energies on the city council \nhad been devoted to issues relating to low-income housing, \nneighborhood preservation and homelessness. I didn't have a lot \nof supporters who were able to write my campaign checks for \n$1,000.\n    Faced with formidable opposition in the race, it was only \nwith the support a Labor Union Political Action Committees and \na few others, that I was able to mount a credible and \nultimately successful bid for the Congress.\n    If not for the support of these special interests, this \nformer civil rights worker, this fourth son of a sharecropper, \nwould not have had a prayer to make it to the United States \nHouse of Representatives. Thus, I was surprised and dismayed in \nrecent years to see political action Committees under attack \nfrom so many different quarters, including many of my friends \nin the public interest communities.\n    Political action Committees, especially those that are \nlabor unions and ideological groups by those supporting or \nopposing abortion rights, gay rights or gun control, they give \nworking people and people with little means the ability to \nparticipate in the political process. Many of these people who \ncontribute with a ``checkoff'' or small deduction from their \npaycheck each week would effectively be denied participation in \nthe process if not for their union or company PAC.\n    Let there be no confusion, minority, women candidates from \npoor rural and urban districts are the beneficiary of political \naction Committees. PACs take power and influence out of the \nhands of the ``country club set'' and put it in the hands of \nthe people who cannot afford to write $500 or $1,000 checks.\n    This is one of the reasons PACs were established and this \nis an exactly why PACs should be protected in any campaign \nreform legislation. To do otherwise is to revert to a system \ncontrolled by "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","wealthy individuals and millionaire candidates who bankroll their own \ncampaign.\n    I know there are those who believe that this was a position \ntaken by Democrats at the time they controlled the House, who \nwere the beneficiary of a majority of PACs. Let me assure my \ncolleagues that even in light of my party's new Minority status \nin this House, even in light of the fact that a majority of PAC \nfunds are now flowing into Republican coffers, I am still \nsupportive of political action Committees and their right to \nparticipate in the political process.\n    I know there are various proposals before this Committee \nnot to reduce or lower PACs contribution but eliminate them \naltogether. Such a move should be resisted. Federal election \nlaw today permits candidates to accept a contribution of $5,000 \nin their primary and $5,000 in the general election. A \nreduction in the contribution limit will have a minimal impact \non the contributions. It would have a disproportionate impact \non minority candidates.\n    I believe that it has been noted before this Committee that \nthe individual limit of $1,000 per person, per election adopted \nin 1974 is worth only about $325 today when adjusted for \ninflation. Similarly, the $5,000 per election limit when \nadjusted, is worth about $1,625. Inflation with no adjustment \nto compensate for it have had the effect of lowering individual \nand political action Committee contribution limits year after \nyear.\n    In 1994, a Common Cause study showed that lowering the PAC \ncontribution limits will cost candidates in competitive races 3 \npercent of their PAC's contribution. Using the same numbers \nshow that a reduction in the limit will cause Members of the \nCongressional Black Caucus more than twice that amount. \nMinority candidates have worked too hard and too long to gain \nequal footing in the political system.\n    CBC and other minority candidates should not be \ndiscriminated against in any campaign finance formula. Indeed, \nMr. Chairman traditionally one of the goals of reform has been \nto open the political process not to throw up roadblocks to \nminority participation.\n    I believe that Congress should pass a strong campaign \nfinance reform bill this year. But it cannot be considered true \nreform if it narrows the scope of who can participate and who \ncan contribute in our political system.\n    Minority and women have waited too long to have a voice in \nthe Congress. We can not impede their gains by jeopardizing \ntheir future. To ensure that this is a fair process for all, \nthis Committee should not lower the PAC limit by eliminating \nPACs.\n    Mr. Chairman, PACs are people, too. Let's not pick on PACs.\n    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Fazio.\n    The Chairman. Thank you very much, Mr. Lewis."

"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    The Chairman. Mr. Gutierrez.\n    Mr. Gutierrez. Thank you very much, Mr. Thomas, and Ranking \nMember, Mr. Fazio. Thank you very much for inviting me to share \nmy ideas with you.\n    Mr. Chairman, these are important hearings and your \ndecision to open up your Committee room to those of us \ninterested in this matter takes us a major step toward the day \nwhen the public feels confident that all the rooms of Congress \nare open to all Americans who have an issue to bring before \ntheir Representatives.\n    Let's face it; at this point, whether it is based on \nperception or reality or a combination of both, many Americans \nbelieve that access to their elected officials is often \ndetermined by relationships cultivated during campaign season, \nparticularly during the fund-raising phase of a campaign.\n    Why is that the case? Because of the flawed campaign \nfinance system that places too high a premium on raising and \nspending excessive funds. I hope that I can offer one possible \nsolution today.\n    I have drafted a bill and it is available in discussion \nform for anyone who wishes to see the legislative language that \nwould decrease candidates dependence on raising huge sums of \nmoney while enhancing the ability of all Americans to \nparticipate in all elements of the political process.\n    How do we reach that goal? For starters, I recommend that \nwe make better use of a mechanism that many people seem intent \non discarding altogether, the Political Action Committee. I \nknow it is popular to bash PACs, and I agree that they often \nhold too much sway over candidates. However, before we throw \nthem out, let's think about whether PACs in a reformed version \ncan be used to cure some of the rest of the system. I believe \nthey can and let me explain.\n    My bill would establish something I like to call the ``PACs \nTax,'' a pool of money we create by penalizing or taxing \ncertain entities like PACs, wealthy candidates, bundlers, \nleadership Committees when they spend at excessive levels. My \nproposal sets up a voluntary limit of $1,000 in contributions \nper candidate from a single PAC during an election.\n    Keep in mind, this does not replace or revoke the current \nhard ceiling of $5,000 that a PAC can give to a single \ncandidate. That would remain intact. However, under my plan if \na PAC chooses to give more than $1,000 to a candidate a PACs \ntax is then imposed. The resulting money would then be \ncollected in a pool which I like to call the ``Electoral Equity \nFund,'' that would administered by the Federal Election \nCommission.\n    Next the money would then be available to candidates who \nagree to spend less than $600,000. He or she would be eligible \nto get up to one-third of his or her money from the PACs tax \npool. To encourage low dollar contributions, the candidate \nwould only receive a reimbursement equal to the amount that was \nraised in individual contributions of $200 or less.\n    Despite the name, PACs tax, I would hope we could use it to \ntarget our sources whose influence should be decreased, on \nleadership PACs, on bundlers, on wealthy candidates who spend \nsizable per"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","sonal fortunes to win a House seat. They would be under my proposal, \nallowed to spend $50,000 of their own money before the penalty \nkicks in. Any campaign that spends $1 million would also be \npenalized. The rates of the penalty would be 39.6 percent. That \nis the highest rate of corporate taxation. Any money raised or \nspent above the suggested limits would be subject to the tax.\n    For example, let's say a PACs maxes out; that is gives \n$5,000 to a single candidate. In that case, the PAC would owe a \npenalty of about $1,584, in other words, 39.6 percent of the \n$4,000 on that contribution. Or let's say a campaign spends \n$1.1 million. The campaign would face a $39,600 tax.\n    Mr. Chairman, let me air some of the concerns that you and \nothers may raise. First, I am willing to concede that our bill \ncontains a big loophole. And to be honest, I am kind of proud \nof this loophole. I think it is a good sign.\n    The loophole is this: It is possible, it is easy for a PAC, \na campaign or a wealthy candidate to avoid paying any penalty \nor tax. All they have to do is lower spending voluntarily. \nEither way, I believe we have accomplished our goal. Either PAC \ndirectors decide to limit their contributions in order to avoid \nthe tax or we will be able to level the playing field thanks to \nthe money that is generated by penalizing the excessive \nspending. I think it is a win-win situation.\n    Let me also point out that I recognize that this bill \npresents some relevant legal questions; namely is it \nconstitutional to impose a penalty on political contributions? \nI would prefer to leave this issue to legal scholars.\n    However, I would at least argue if this constitutional \nquestion is applicable to my bill, then it should certainly be \nraised in connection with those proposals to seek to ban PACs \naltogether.\n    I would also argue that my bill is in keeping with the body \nof legal precedence surrounding this issue because I see my \nbill as creating incentives to abide by the limits rather than \nsimply creating penalties for those who break them. The \ncandidate has the incentive to spend less to accept lower \ndollar contributions.\n    Clearly, there is a real hunger in America for political \nreform and I think that this is a proposal that might just \nachieve that. It means that we must do more than simply keep \nwhat works or throw away what doesn't. It requires us to take \nthe best elements of the current system, revise them, reform \nthem in a way that helps us reach our goal of creating a \npolitical system that creates greater contact between all \ncandidates and constituents. I think my proposal has some \nmerits and would love to discuss it with you and others.\n    Thank you."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Mr. White. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And I thank \nthe Ranking Member. You are very kind to allow me a little time \nto talk to you today, and I do have a written statement that I \nhave submitted for the record. But what I would like to----\n    The Chairman. Let me say at this point, that if any of the \nother Members have written statements, without objection, they \nwill be made a part of the record.\n    Mr. White. I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n    First of all, I would like to say, and this isn't in my \nwritten statement, but I am here with a great deal of humility \nthis morning. I recognize this Committee, the Chairman in \nparticular, has been at the forefront of efforts to reform the \nfinance laws, to reform the franking laws, and many of the \nother problems we have in our political system that really need \nto be addressed.\n    Personally, I am new to politics. This is my first elected \noffice. I had never run for office before running for this \noffice in 1994. So I really do come before this Committee with \nsome humility.\n    Having said that, I think being new I also bring a \nperspective that probably is useful in this procedure, and I \nwould like to just spend a minute or two talking about my \nrecent race. Because at least for me it shed some light on what \nis wrong with our current system.\n    As I mentioned, I had never run for office before, and I \ncan remember the day very clearly, it was Thanksgiving Day, \n1992, when I sat down with my dad after a nice Thanksgiving \ndinner, maybe we had had a little bit too much wine with our \nturkey, and told him that I was thinking about running for \nCongress. And as we went through the process and tried to \nfigure out what we would have to do, we realized that we would \nprobably have to raise about $500,000 to have a credible \ncampaign. And we spent a lot of time trying to figure out how \nwe would do that.\n    Ultimately decided, like most people, to do that, we would \nhave to start with the people who knew me the best, my family \nand friends, and that is exactly what we did. I raised money \nfrom my dad, from my Aunt Wanda, from my Uncle Brooks, from the \nguy down the street at the grocery store, from everybody who \nknew me the best. And slowly but surely we accumulated a little \nbit of a campaign treasury. I also tried to raise some money \nfrom PACs. And I can say we tried as hard as we could to get \ntheir attention and didn't have much success. Ultimately in the \ncampaign, we raised about $550,000 during the election cycle; \n$40,000 of that came from PACs. The rest was from individuals."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Now I was running against an incumbent, and by contrast, I \nraised about $550,000 overall, including $40,000 from PACs. My \nopponent raised about $500,000 from PACs alone. And we did a \nlittle analysis of the PAC contributions after the campaign, \nand we realized that my $40,000 came primarily from the PAC at \nmy own law firm, my dad's company's PAC, the PAC of a friend of \nthe family who had been the best man at my wedding, those sorts \nof connections.\n    With very few exceptions did any PAC that I didn't have a \npersonal relationship with contribute to my campaign. By \ncontrast, my opponent had maximum contributions at the $10,000 \nlevel from at least 15 labor organizations. That is $150,000 \njust right out of the box, and a number of major contributions \nfrom PACs all around the country for a total of about $500,000.\n    Now, the conclusion I drew from this, Mr. Chairman, and I \nrecognize this is only one example, but the conclusion I drew, \nand I draw today, is that PACs are vastly skewed in favor of \nthe incumbent. At least in my case that turned out to be true. \nAnd having said that, as I sat down to think about the campaign \nfinance reform system, I really concluded that every part of \nthe campaign finance system is essentially skewed in favor of \nthe incumbent, and I have come to believe that everything this \nHouse has done in the past is like--has been skewed in favor of \nthe incumbent, and just about everything we can expect this \nHouse reasonably to do in the future will probably be biased in \nfavor of the incumbent.\n    It is really just asking a little bit too much, I think, of \nourselves, to impose upon ourselves restrictions that are going \nto allow challengers a better chance of beating us. And so the \nconclusion I came up with was that the only way we are ever \ngoing to solve this problem and make sure the challengers have \nan equal chance is to come up with something like a commission \nthat will look at the system in an unbiased way and propose \nsomething for an up or down vote.\n    So on Tuesday of this week, I introduced H.R. 2635, the \nFair Elections Act, which would call for a commission similar \nto the Base Closure Commission. It is a 12-member commission, \nfour Republicans, four Democrats, four independents. It has 90 \ndays to come up with a plan. Congress has to vote on the plan \nwithin 30 days after it has been proposed.\n    It has only three goals, only three directions in my bill \nwould be given to this Committee: Number one, come up with a \nsystem that allows for fair and meaningful elections; number \ntwo, try to eliminate the influence of special interest money \non the outcome of elections; and, number three, try to design a \nsystem that doesn't give incumbents an unfair advantage. It is \na straight from the shoulder, simple and fair approach to \ntrying to come up with a campaign finance system that really \nworks for both challengers and incumbents.\n    Mr. Chairman, I don't know what this commission would do \nwith PACs. It might decide to expand their role; it might \ndecide to limit their role. But I do know that about the only \nway we are going to end up with a fair campaign finance system \nis to let somebody other than Congress make the initial \ndecision. And I hope this "

break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Mr. Dickey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    My experience is this. I have had two elections and I have \nnot taken PAC money at all, and I think because of that I can \nspeak about some things that other people can, in fact, only \nlook at and not actually--and not feel.\n    What happens is that when a person doesn't take PACs, they \nidentify more with the people who are on the lower end of the \neconomy, the lower end of the income stream. And what those \nfolks are saying is that we don't have any access to this \nsystem because you all are deciding all that according to how \nmuch money is given and who is giving it and the PACs are the \nones that are leading the way.\n    I think we need to somehow remember that if we can \neliminate PACs giving money, that we will bring those people \ninto the system where they will feel more like there is a good \nreason to vote, more like giving $10 or $25 or even $5, as in \nsome cases I received. And I think it is something we ought to \nseriously consider as we move through this. They think that the \nsole ticket to participation in politics is money. If we \neliminated that, it would be awfully good.\n    The other thing that the people like who are on the lower \nend of this--on the scale of the economy is that candidates \nhave to approach them, that they really need them, that they \ncome and they do it through mailings as I do and through \nsolicitations and even sometimes in advertisements in \nnewspapers, that we are saying we want the little contribution.\n    Right now I am working on a project called Project 39, \nwhere we are asking for people to give no more or no less than \n$39. And it is the sort of thing that I believe is necessary in \nthe whole scheme of things to keep our system strong, because \nwe need those people and we need to let them know about it.\n    I thought that when I--when I fought the PACs like Rick did \nin my elections, I thought it was a philosophical conviction \nthat was leading the people to, the PACs, to decide to support \nmy opponent. I really did. I thought this is the sort of thing \nthat we have a difference, and I was out pitching the theme \nabout being a conservative and we have to save money and so \nforth.\n    And then all of a sudden, the first three months of this \nyear it came and I saw this money coming, overflowing from the \nDemocrats to the Republicans, and I got a cheap feeling. I got \na feeling like it is really--it really is going to be true, \nthose people down there at the lower end of the economy and the \nstream of income are going to say, yes, see, that is exactly \nwhat is happening. It is not a philosophical conviction, it is \nnot someone who is saying through the PACs this is our \nexpression of our opinion about how you are doing. It is power, \nit is control, and it is a majority rule in Congress. And \nagain, as we look at it from the standpoint of that lowly \nperson who is saying, I have a choice to just get out of this, "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","I don't have to register, I don't have to vote, I don't have to do \nanything, I can't afford to give to PACs, I am just going to \nopt out.\n    Now, I am saying if we continue like we are going, and we \nare watching these examples take place, then we can't deny it. \nWe get to the point where we just actually can't deny it. I \nknow this, that in my elections I have the freedom to say that \nthere wasn't any PAC that I owed my election to.\n    I heard Representative Lewis say, I couldn't do it without \nit. I don't believe that is the case. Representative Lewis \nactually came into my district and campaigned against me. I \nknow how forceful he is. You understand? And I am just saying, \nhe could have done it by himself. But if he had of and he \ndidn't owe it to the PACs and he said, I relied on the people, \njust think about the constructiveness of that experience. And I \nthink he is--we are deprived of it because we don't do it.\n    PACs are needed. I want to say that for sure. We need the \nadvocacy of PACs. We need people who are coming in who are \nsquares, not well-rounded in information, but just squares, and \nsay, look, we don't know about all these other issues but we \nknow about this one and this is how this is unfair and this is \nhow our position is needed. But we need for our influence to be \ninfluence information and not money. The influence of the PACs \nneeds to be through information and through working hard, not \nthrough money.\n    You see, what we are doing by promoting the PACs and by \npromoting the lobbyists and so forth, we are asking them to \nhire people who are experts and skillful in manipulation. And \nwhat happens is they want to manipulate us and they want to buy \ninfluence. Other than that, we wouldn't have this great swing \nover to the Republicans with this PAC money, millions of \ndollars. And don't think those eyes aren't watching us that \nmake up the strength of this Nation. The small, middle-class \nindividual.\n    Now, I think it is essential that we pay attention to them \nand that we say no to the PAC money being given, and that way \nfree them to be a part of strengthening our system, rather than \ndestroying it with this PAC money going for access and for \ninfluence and blatantly saying, we expect something from you \nbecause we have given you this money, or we are going to \nwithhold it next time and you will never get reelected.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman.

"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Mr. Gilchrest. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You just need a \nsling and a rock.\n    I am going to be relatively brief. I want to just take a \nfew seconds to give a little boring background which led me to \nthis place, the U.S. Congress. Everybody, 435 Members of \nCongress, have fascinating stories to tell as to the road they \ntook to get here.\n    In 1986, I decided to quit my job as a schoolteacher and go \nlive in the wilderness in the northern Rocky Mountains. A year \nlater I broke my jaw in a horse accident, came back unemployed, \nstarted painting houses to keep the family together, decided it \nwould be interesting to run for Congress.\n    While I was painting houses, I ran in 1988 against an \nincumbent and got 49.6 percent of the vote. The primary \nelection, against another Republican, I won with $300. The \nincumbent spent about $800,000. I spent $100,000. And it was \npretty close. Certainly raised my status.\n    In 1990, I won with 57 percent of the vote, still outspent \nabout 8 to 1 in the second election. In 1992, I ran against \nanother incumbent who was pretty good at basketball. He spent \nabout $1.600 million; we spent about $300,000. We did take a \nlittle PAC money, but it was probably about 20 to 25 percent of \nthe total cost of the campaign.\n    Now, what I would like to--and I am not a evangelical \npreacher of campaign finance reform. But in an ideal world, I \nsuppose, from my perspective, it would be positive to do the \nfollowing: Take no money from anybody unless they can vote for \nyou.\n    Now, I didn't create that idea. Campaigning in 1988, I ran \nacross a carpenter going from door to door, shopping plaza to \nshopping plaza, supermarket to supermarket, I ran across a \ncarpenter who was sitting down eating lunch on a bench near a \npark and I introduced myself and I said, you know, talked a \nlittle bit about Congress and so on, and he said, I haven't \nvoted since the Eisenhower days. I said, why not? He says, \nbecause money is the poison that has caused the problem in the \npolitical arena, and until that is changed, I won't \nparticipate. And I said, what would you do? And he said, the \nlaw should be that no one can give you money unless they can \nvote for you.\n    Now I know this is sort of extreme, but like some of the \nother Members that are testifying, I did it, I tried it. What I \nthink it has done has caused a number of things to happen. \nNumber one, you better go out there and find people that are \ngoing to support you. Now I didn't go to my family and ask them \nfor money. I said, I am going to run for Congress, can you help \nme pass out fliers? Now they gradually gave me a few bucks, but \nI didn't go to the family or friends. I didn't even go to my \nfriends first because I was embarrassed to ask them for money \nunless I was going to paint their window or cut their grass or \nsomething. But it is a group of people that "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","recognize that you have something to contribute. So they surround you, \nthey encourage you, you begin the process of raising a few \nfunds, you get a little bit of credibility, you have a message. \nBut the point is, you work very hard and you are dedicated to a \nposition and people begin to recognize that.\n    Now I know some of the people up here probably testified \nearlier about public financing, and I know to a large extent \npeople feel that that is a perspective that would level the \nplaying field. One of the reasons I don't--two reasons I don't \nthink we should have public financing. Number one, if you are \nout there and you are an individual and you have the courage or \nthe tenacity or the insanity to run for Congress, you have to \nspend a lot of time strategizing how you are going to do it and \nwhat your message is. I would think if you are going to get \n$60,000, a hundred thousand dollars from taxpayers' money, \nbalancing out what you raise, you are going to count on that \ninstead of going to another shopping plaza, going to another \ngroup of voters to talk to them, or raising some money in an \ningenious way. It sort of takes away from the creativity.\n    The other thing is, the perception of it to the public is \nwe are trying to balance the budget, we are reducing Federal \nspending, and I just think across the board if people felt that \ntheir tax dollars were going to somebody that decided they \nwanted to run for Congress is not the thing we want to do at \nthis particular time. So we have dropped the Voter Empowerment \nAct and we feel that--I feel, and we have done it several times \nnow, it would be interesting if we pass the law that you can't \ntake money from anybody unless they can vote for you.\n    And I know there is some constitutional questions involved \nin that. But I do think, like the Members have testified here, \nthat we need to do something for the perception of money and \npolitics, and then we need to do something to actually clean up \nthe system so that everybody has a fair playing field.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Thank you very much."

"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    The Chairman. I want to thank all of the panelists, not \njust for your testimony and diverse positions, but for your \nwillingness to return after you testified.\n    To begin the series of questions of the Members, I would \nlike to call on the gentlewoman from Washington, who prior to \nbecoming a Member of Congress was in fact the Chairman of a \npolitical party in the State of Washington, and has been \ninvolved in this area for a long time. She has her own \nperspectives, and will be a major contributor as we go forward \nin this process. The gentlewoman from Washington.\n    Ms. Dunn. I thank the Chairman, and thank all of you who \ncame to testify. This has been a wonderful series of panels to \ndiscuss a very broad area of campaign finance reform.\n    I am a supporter of those who believe we have got to look \ndeeply into each one of these campaign finance issues so that \nwe can put a package together that is well-integrated. PACs are \nsimply one portion of that package. I suspect some of you on \nthe panel would like to be addressing other parts of the issue, \nand as we go through these hearings between now and May, I hope \nyou will feel comfortable to return and help us out with some \nof the other areas.\n    I have dealt with this issue for many years as a party \nChairman who helped other people collect money, be elected to \noffice, and I dealt with interest groups and dealt with the \nissue from the position of a candidate, because of these \nexperiences, my sense is that what we want to do is create a \nscenario that allows competitiveness, that allows the \nchallenger to step into the ring and be able to work against an \nincumbent who is usually very, very well-financed for a number \nof reasons, who is additionally able to get his or her message \nout to the people in an effective way, not necessarily through \nthe choice words of the media, and is able to present his or \nher point of view on issues in order to inform the public. So I \nthink when it comes to PACs, I am not one who would outlaw \nPACs. I don't think that is the right way to go. I want to take \na very deliberative look at this whole thing.\n    I am going to spend the rest of my time, Mr. Chairman, with \nMr. White, since he is from my home State. I recall on election \nnight standing next to him as we watched the returns. He had \nrun against a well-financed incumbent, a colleague of Ms. \nMaloney, who came to Congress at the same time Ms. Maloney did, \nand who was very much a favorite of the Speaker of the House.\n    I really want to get to the core of this. Rick, tell us in \nyour campaign how PAC money affected your race. Do you feel at \nthis point that you are selling your vote to an interest group \nthat has helped to elect you to office? And do you believe that \nthere should be some influence cast by folks who belong to \ninterest groups who live outside your congressional district?\n    Mr. White. Well, Jennifer, number one, let me say thank you \nvery much for your kind words and for all the help you have \ngiven me and also for being a leader on this issue. But I would \nsay if there is an interest group that I feel beholden to at \nthe present time, it is basically my Aunt Wanda. That is where \nmy initial campaign contributions came from, from my family and \nmy friends, and she does not have a PAC, but she has been very \nsupportive. And that is the way my campaign had to start."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    As I mentioned earlier in my testimony, we ended up the \ncampaign begging, pleading, doing everything we possibly could \nto raise $40,000 in PAC money. My opponent seemed to have no \ntrouble whatsoever raising $500,000 in PAC money, almost the \ntotal amount that I raised during that period of time. And so \nmy conclusion was that, at least in my case, the PAC \ncontributions worked very much in favor of the incumbent. And \nwhether there are people who feel beholden to them or not, I \ndon't know, but I do think that the main problem I saw is that \nthey favor the person who is already in office.\n    Ms. Dunn. Let me ask, since I still have a little time \nleft, a question of Mr. Gilchrest.\n    Wayne, you have got a unique situation, and talk about a \nMember with lots of different backgrounds and great interest to \nall of us, you are somebody that we have enjoyed so much \nworking with here in the Congress. What I really want to get \nat, Wayne, you didn't take PAC money, you didn't take \ncontributions from people outside the district. Was this \nbecause the incumbent was very unpopular? What I want to know \nis how did you get your message across to people and what can \nyou do, if we limit or equalize PAC contributions to what an \nindividual could give? How do you get the message out as a \nchallenger? Is it impossible? Does it depend on a district \nwhere the incumbent is weak, or do you believe truly that we \ncan do this considering all the advantages that an incumbent \nautomatically has outside the realm of PAC contributions?\n    Mr. Gilchrest. Those are good questions, Jennifer. Both \nincumbents had, whether it was Mr. Dyson or I forget the other \nfellow's name now, Tom McMillen, that is right. They had an \nenormous amount of radio ads, an enormous number of TV and so \non.\n    What we had to do was to be as creative with our message, \nknowing that we would have very limited time with it, to \ncounter what the traditional dollars do for people that run \nrather large negative campaigns. And we, I think creative--\ncreatively created a message that people could grab ahold of, \neven though we had a radio ad, for example, in I guess my third \ncampaign, and only ran about two weeks, maybe even a little bit \nless than that, but it caught on and started this prairie fire \nthat people began to talk about.\n    I understand how difficult it is to just do away with PAC \nmoney, to say that all PACs are corrupt, because there is a lot \nof good PAC communities out there, and to say that they overly \ninfluence a Member of Congress because I know they don't always \nnecessarily do that. I just go back to the basics and say that \nif you think about what you believe in and you understand in a \nbroad way and in some specific way what is good for your \ncongressional district and what is good for the country, and \nyou keep to that message, you are going to overcome an awful \nlot.\n    Ms. Dunn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Thank you. The gentleman from California, \nRanking Member, Mr. Fazio."
"fazio","Mr. Fazio","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And let me apologize, I \nhave to go run a caucus meeting. And I am just going to kind of \nthrow out a couple of things and hope that you can respond. And "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","believe me, I will get the response even though I can't sit here and \nhear it directly.\n    I think everybody is focused on the small donor issue. And \nI think it is something we all seek. It helps validate us. We \nhave at the same time learned that direct mail is not the \nanswer for Members of the House. That may be for Senators of \ngreat prominence. Certainly the only Members that I know of in \nthe House who do well with direct mail or now telemarketing \nwould be people on the ideological extremes. I know Bob Dornan \nhas had some success; I think Ron Dellums used to. But there \nreally isn't much that most Members can do in that regard. Some \nhave looked at the checkoff on our tax form as a way of getting \nsmall donors to participate. I don't think that is a coercive \nuse of public funds. It is a voluntary use of public funds. But \nwe have been unable to move it from the Presidential campaign \nto Congress and some would even repeal it for the Presidential.\n    At the same time, we all talk about how much time we spend \nraising money. Every one of you would say, I want to do the job \nI was elected to do, I hate to have to go down to the campaign \nCommittee or over to the firm I have hired and spend my time \ndialing for dollars. But the implications are if we are going \nto raise individual money in small amounts, we are going to \nspend a lot of time raising it. And as we lower limits for PACs \nor individuals or whatever, we are going to be spending even \nmore to get even less. So I would be interested in your \ncomments about how we go about reconciling the anomaly of \nwanting to reduce the amount of what we receive and yet somehow \nreduce the amount of time we spend to raise it. Because I think \nthey are in direct conflict.\n    I would want to say in addition that I think while we talk \na good deal about anti-incumbency in the current atmosphere, \nwhenever we look at how we fix the campaign laws, we assume a \ngreat incumbent advantage. And yet as I look at this panel, \nmost of you are rather recent arrivals. We have only turned the \nHouse over by 50 percent, plus, since 1990. It is not a long-\nterm assignment these days. I think most of us realize that the \nadvantages of incumbency are far more related to the political \natmosphere than to anything we give to candidates for office as \na tool, whether it be to run the first time or to run for \nreelection.\n    And let me just say in final comment, and I am interested \nin your reactions, many people have come and said, I have not \ncollected PAC money, I have only run with individual money. I \nthink you will find as a general rule, and I don't want to pick \non the gentleman from Hope, but he is a good example.\n    Mr. Dickey. I am from Pine Bluff. I represent Hope.\n    The Chairman. He represents Hope."
"fazio","Mr. Fazio","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    I thought I would build on the Chairman's \ncomment. He represents Hope; he represents charity and faith as \nwell. And those who have given to his charity have contributed \nto the tune of 60 percent of his money from the people who \ncontribute over $200. They are not necessarily the little \npeople who would give $10 or $15 or $25.\n    So while I give you credit, Jay, you certainly deserve it \nfor hard work in fund-raising. I don't think we are free of \nhaving large interested givers as part of the mix, even when we \neschew PACs as "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","a way to go. And there are ample examples of people who give to PACs \nwho are giving $5 or $10 or what have you, whether or not they \nlive in your district. They are contributing in small sums.\n    So let me just conclude by saying, Carolyn, maybe you can \nhelp enlighten us as to how to get that small donor. You have \ngot a new idea about small donor PACs limited to $25. It is \nprobably typical of far more PACs than people here would \nunderstand or believe, given the talk about big money to PACs. \nBut I do think we do all want to concentrate on how to get \nsmaller donors back into the game. Matching funds have been \nsuggested as a way to do it. Maybe there are other ways. Maybe \npeople are more confident of in-district giving, as Wayne \nsuggests.\n    With that, Mr. Chairman, I would be interested to read the \nremarks of my colleagues and I have to run.\n    Mrs. Maloney. Thank you very much. I propose creating a \nsmall donor citizen PAC that would be limited to $25. A citizen \nwould not contribute more than $25. And this small donor \ncitizen PAC would be limited to a contribution from this PAC \nper election of a thousand dollars. And the time to collect \nthat money would be done by people who are affiliated with that \nPAC.\n    To make Mr. Gilchrest's example of collecting only from \nyour district, and in my proposal I propose that 75 percent of \nyour money come from your district. But you could have a \nCitizens Committee that would then have fund-raisers and \ncollect small donations.\n    Again, I think that what we want to look at is limiting the \ninfluence of money in the system. And we all have our examples. \nIn my first race, my opponent outspent me 6 to 1, $1.5 million \nto $250,000. And I had the example that you gave, that it was \nvery, very difficult to raise money.\n    In my last race, both my opponent and I were very \nsuccessful fund-raisers. But if what we want to do is limit the \ninfluence of money, I don't see any difference between a \ncontribution from an individual and a contribution from a PAC. \nMaybe we need to change the mix, limit a third to small donor \nPACs, a third to big donor PACs, a third to individuals. But I \ndon't see the difference, whether a member of a union \ncontributes $25 to his PAC that then gives a candidate $500, \nand the executive giving a candidate $500. So I feel that money \nis money, and what we need to do is limit the influence of \nspecial interest or money by limiting contribution limits and \nspending limits.\n    The Chairman. The gentlewoman's time has expired.\n    The gentleman from Maryland."
"hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't have any \nspecific questions. I missed the first, and I am in the process \nof reading your statements now, while I also listen to the \nanswers.\n    Mr. White, you are in favor of a commission, is that----\n    Mr. White. Yes, sir. I proposed a commission, yes."
"hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    You mentioned in answer to Ms. Dunn's question \nabout PACs and about how PACs had contributed very \nsubstantially to your opponent. But I take it you are not a--\nyou are a supporter of PACs?\n    Mr. White. Frankly, I am kind of agnostic on the issue. I \nmean, I will say that one of the troubling things is that I \nhave noticed--\n    The Chairman. He used more aunts."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","fund-raising now that I am an incumbent than I was before, \nwhich really confirms my concern that there is an advantage to \nincumbents. As I say, I really don't trust us. I don't trust \nRepublicans or Democrats or anybody in Congress to come up with \na system that is really going to be fair. And I think your best \napproach to get a fair system is to come up with a commission, \nnone of whom are currently elected Members of Congress, and let \nthose people try to come up with a system that works. I think \nthat is the best approach."
"hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    My understanding of the commission proposal is \nthat it has a mechanism for those items that had two-thirds and \nthose that had 50 percent, and those that had two-thirds would \nautomatically come to the Floor, those that had half of the \ncommission would come and go through the regular Committee \nprocess, as I suggested, as the Speaker's suggestion. Is that \nessentially what you are suggesting?\n    Mr. White. Actually, it is not. That was the Speaker's \nsuggestion. Mine would require just a simple majority of the \nfull commission to send a proposal to Congress, and then it has \nto get an up or down vote under a procedure kind of like the \nBRAC Commission. I would say my proposal is pretty similar to \nthe Speaker's. Great minds work alike on these things. But we \ndo have some significant differences."
"hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    I won't make any comments about that. Such a \ngreat opening, Rick, but I am not going to take it.\n    Mr. White. I appreciate that."

"hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    Your essential position is you think PACs ought \nto be outlawed?\n    Mr. Dickey. Yes, sir. It is a matter of perception, not \nnecessarily reality."
"hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    And what does that mean, Jay?\n    Mr. Dickey. Well, what I am saying is I think what we--what \nis happening is we are leaving the individuals out. What Vic \nsaid a while ago is what can we do not to spend so much time, \nyou know, raising money. If we are doing it to individuals--and \nparticularly in our districts or in our State, we are \nparticipating in the forming of representation that is \nbeneficial.\n    You know, this business about coming back home is the \nnumber one issue with my people and if we are coming back. So \nit is a matter of perception and not reality that we are not \nconvince--I don't think we are influenced by people who give \nmoney. Let's say the machinist group in Washington State giving \nmoney to my campaign, I don't really think I am influenced that \nmuch by it, but it is the perception of how it resonates with \nthe individual voter at the lower end of the economy."
"hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    Jay, one of the things that I have argued, you \nmay not agree with, but in 1974, of course, when PACs were \nfirst adopted, they were adopted quite obviously to meet the \nClement Stone issue, where he took 2 plus million out of his \npocket and gave it "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","secretly to Nixon. And I am sure we had people on our side that gave a \nlot of money out of their pocket, because they had a lot of \nmoney in their pocket.\n    So PACs were devised as an organization to allow relatively \nsmall contributors--Carolyn Maloney speaks to that, as to how \nsmall is small, how large is large--to collectively contribute \nin sums sufficient to make an impact. They were a great reform.\n    Frankly, I think they are still a reform, personally, Jay. \nThe reason is this. If Sam Brown, Sally Jones and Mary Smith \neach give $500 or $1,000 to my campaign and list their address \nas 1,000 East 22nd Street, et cetera, Hyattsville, Maryland, \nyou see that on the list, you have no idea why they gave me a \nthousand dollars. They may even have given it because one of \nthem was my aunt, as Rick has, or one of them may have given to \nme because they want me to vote X way and I agreed to vote X \nway. But the fact of the matter is, it is very difficult to \ndetermine.\n    But when the Steelworkers give me $1,000 or $5,000, there \nis no doubt in anybody's mind what the Steelworkers are \ninterested in, and the public can make a determination Hoyer is \ndoing their bidding or Hoyer is getting support for them \nbecause he believes in the same things they do.\n    Mr. Dickey. That is the perception. Yes, you are right."
"hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    So I think it is complicated in terms of the \nultimate reform was and continues to be, in my opinion, giving \nthe public the information on which to make an informed \njudgment.\n    Mr. Dickey. Well, what do you think we ought to do, Steny?"
"hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    I think we ought to limit expenditures, as we \ndid in some of the bills that have passed, and limit the mix. I \nthink that was a good strategy to do.\n    I think there is obviously, as Wayne Gilchrest and others \nhave proposed and the Republican Party has proposed I think \nmore vigorously than our party has, greater reliance perhaps on \ncontributions from your district. But there is, obviously, a \ndownside to that, because in some districts one party, usually \nthe Republican Party but not exclusively, has pretty much a \ncorner on the wealth of the district. And that--Lewis has \nspoken to that, as I understand it, earlier; and that is a \nproblem. And I don't know how we deal with that problem, and I \nhave tended to believe that we ought not to limit to too great \nan extent just in district.\n    Because, very frankly, what all of us do does not just \nimpact on our district. It impacts on the entire country. Wayne \nGilchrest's leadership on environmental issues impacts on my \ndistrict as well as his district, and it impacts on California \nand Colorado and Montana as well as it does on the First \nDistrict of Maryland.\n    In any event, I thank the Chairman for the time; and I \nagree with Ms. Dunn, this has been an interesting and important \nhearing.\n    The Chairman. Thank the gentleman. I am going to ask each \none of you some questions based on your testimony, but if \nsomeone else feels the spirit moved them, obviously to go ahead \nand respond. I am trying to focus on what I consider in my \nopinion some of the important aspects of your testimony.\n    Ms. Maloney, in the first hearing I indicated that there is \nonly one judge on the Supreme Court today that actually \nparticipated "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","in the Buckley v. Valeo decision. He was an Associate Justice at the \ntime. He is now the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Chief \nJustice Rehnquist. Although Justice Stevens was on the court, \nhe did not participate in the decision.\n    Your argument that perhaps we ought to test constitutional \nlimits I think is shared by a number of folk, not just because \nthe Court has changed but I think because times have changed to \na certain extent. We have a better understanding of what we are \ndoing.\n    My assumption is that the dollar amounts that you provide \nfor your concept of a small-donor, large-donor PAC are \nrelative, they are not absolute. You mentioned a $25 amount it \nmight be 50 or some other kind of a figure. You want to \ndifferentiate between people who contribute larger amounts and \nsmaller amounts. Why is the dollar amount--if it is under \nwhatever the prescribed limit, why does that make a qualitative \ndifference, in your opinion?\n    Mrs. Maloney. Well, one of the things that you are trying \nto do is limit the mix of contributors to campaigns, and one of \nthe things that we are trying do is get more small donors, more \nindividuals involved in the political process.\n    The Chairman. Why?\n    Mrs. Maloney. I think that that is a--it involves more \npeople in their government, that they are having a direct \ncontact, feel that they are part of the system, that are \nsupporting people that they believe in. But, as all of us know, \nit is very, very difficult to organize fund-raisers and to \norganize outreach. As Mr. Fazio mentioned very eloquently \nearlier, most of us spend more time than we would like fund-\nraising.\n    Now there is one way we could do--we could just say we are \ngoing to limit individual contributions and PAC contributions \nto $25. Then that would mean all of us would have to spend all \nour time on the phone.\n    The Chairman. I understand, but we have got to limit the \nresponses. And, obviously, we can go into it. We are going to \nhave a series of hearings on this. But it used to be the old \nsaying that time was money and that to a certain extent if \npeople couldn't contribute they could volunteer and that you \ncould get services out of people without necessarily having \nthem contribute.\n    One of the concerns which we will bring it up as we focus \nspecifically on political parties is that, in part, times have \nchanged, in part, people have changed; but it is my personal \nopinion, and I want to explore it with a number of people who I \nthink will come before us, it is perhaps the way in which the \nlaws have been written which have also changed. The emphasis \nfrom the old time is money and, therefore, participation is \nvaluable versus contributions.\n    But I think your notion that a structure of ability to \nparticipate on a maximum level is governed by the amount that \neach individual contributes places a relatively high \nqualitative judgment on the size of the contribution, and that \nis something that we will obviously talk about. For the life of \nme, I am trying to figure out the qualitative advantage of \nbeing able to put more dollars in the system. That is the one \nthing that I was wrestling with in terms of your position.\n    Mr. Lewis."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    Mrs. Maloney. May I respond very briefly?\n    The Chairman. Very briefly.\n    Mrs. Maloney. I wasn't calling for more dollars in the \nsystem. I was calling, as you know, for a limit on spending and \na diversification of the contributors to that limit.\n    The Chairman. And I understand that. People who contribute \nless--people who contribute less individually get to contribute \nmore collectively, under your system. Isn't that true?\n    Mrs. Maloney. No, they would be limited to a third, a \nthird, a third. A third for individuals, a third for----\n    The Chairman. No, but each PAC. I thought your citizen PAC \nwould contribute twice as much, $1,000, versus the large donor \nPACs, $500. That is incorrect?\n    Mrs. Maloney. Well, I would drop to $500. I would drop to \n$100, $100 in individual----\n    The Chairman. We are not yet writing limits. We will \nnegotiate the amount later.\n    Mrs. Maloney. And $100--I don't even have a bill in yet. I \nwas just throwing out ideas. But I would fall to $100 in \nindividual, $100 in small PAC, and $100 in big PAC. So my main \npoint that I am trying to make is money is money, whether it \ncomes from a large corporation, a union or a housekeeper who \nonly makes $500 a week.\n    The Chairman. I understand. But your original proposal, the \nproposal you presented in your testimony, was a differential in \nthe total amount a Political Action Committee could contribute \nbased upon the size of the contribution of the individuals in \nthe political action Committee. And my reaction to that was why \nquantitatively different amounts of money of individuals allows \na quantitative difference? You have moved away from that a \nlittle bit.\n    My follow-up question would have been, it seems to me that \nyou are basically favoring a particular type of PAC \nhistorically, and that would have been a union-based PAC versus \na nonunion-based PAC. But the statement that you just made in \nterms of the amount of money is not as critical moves away from \nthat qualitative difference.\n    Mrs. Maloney. My main point is money is money; and I would \nsupport, just to make it very clear, a limit of $100 in \nindividual, $100 in a large PAC; and I think it would be a good \nidea to create a smaller PAC for small contributions, $100 from \na small PAC. But my main thing is we want to limit the \ninfluence of money, and by limiting it we can have a different \nmix. And, again, I think that we should challenge Buckley v. \nValeo, go to the Supreme Court and have a fallback position if \nwe don't win in the Supreme Court.\n    The Chairman. I understand that. But then the follow-up \nquestion would be if you are going to limit to such a small \namount individual contributions, would my contribution to a PAC \ncount toward the total that an individual could give? In other \nwords, if I gave individually I could give, under your scenario \nnow, $100. But if I gave to 10 different PACs $100, which would \nbe the amount that I could give, or $25, the cumulative amount \nof giving to PACs would be greater than the amount that an \nindividual could give.\n    So would you limit the contribution to PACs in that concept \nof yours to the total amount that could be given by an \nindividual? In "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","other words, through PACs, could an individual give more to a candidate \nthan they could individually?\n    Mrs. Maloney. I think we should limit it to an individual \ncontribution, whether you give to a PAC or your own individual \ncontribution.\n    The Chairman. Then the contribution to the PACs ought to be \nequal to the maximum contribution that an individual could \ngive. Otherwise, if you give to a PAC, you are giving less than \nyou could have given if you gave individually. That is the \npoint I am trying to raise. When you try----\n    Mrs. Maloney. That is a----\n    The Chairman. Let me make the final statement, okay, so \nthat I can move on to Mr. Lewis.\n    When you began shifting numbers around to try to create a \nqualitative difference in terms of a giving situation, as we \nhave seen from legislation that has come up since the early \n1970s, you create unanticipated consequences that you have to \ndeal with. And although I will enjoy talking with you in terms \nof the mix and match of the size of contributions individually \nto PACs and to others, I will continue to come back at you with \nthe consequences either qualitatively or quantitatively of the \nway in which we change the numbers. But I look forward to \ndiscussion.\n    The Chairman. I would tell the gentlewoman that I would \nlike to ask the gentleman from Georgia some questions.\n    In your comments, Mr. Lewis, I think you bump up against \nthe Court decision as well. Because, frankly, as you may know, \nin the early 1970s, Congress limited the amount that \nindividuals could contribute; and the Court declared that \nunconstitutional; and, frankly, a number of us also think we \ncould pursue that statutorily with the new Court. I am just \nwondering if you believe that the individual limit has a \nconstitutional basis to it, or would you be willing to explore \nlimiting individuals statutorily?\n    I know your bill doesn't, but I wonder if you have any \ndiscomfort level from a constitutional point of view about \ntelling someone that they would be restricted on how much they \ncould contribute of their own money to their own election.\n    Mr. Lewis. Well, I have some concern in that it may be a \nviolation of people's rights to participate, a whole question \nof freedom of speech, to tell a person you can only use a \ncertain amount of your own money. It is something that I would \nlike to explore.\n    The Chairman. The problem, of course, is that when we talk \nabout freedom of speech, it is whether you do it with your own \nlungs or a megaphone; and, unfortunately, dollars are the \ndetermination, in part, of whether it is your own lungs or a \nmegaphone.\n    I was very appreciative of your focus on the relative value \nof the current limit, both on PACs and individuals, because I \nhave tried to interview people who were involved in the process \nin the early 1970s and what they thought about how much $1,000 \nwas and how much $5,000 was. There were debates that went on \nconcerning what the limit should be, and they came up with what \nthey thought was an appropriate amount of money. It wasn't $325 \nfor individuals, and it wasn't $1,675 for PACs. It was $1,000 \nfor individuals and $5,000 for PACs. I have asked, why didn't \nyou think "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","about indexing the limits? Their answer was, we thought that was a lot \nof money.\n    Mr. Lewis. Well, Mr. Chairman, I guess back in 1974, $1,000 \nfor a lot of people appeared to be a lot of money, and $5,000 \nappeared. But today, in 1995, we move toward 1996, it is \nreally--you can't get that much for $1,000, $325 maybe, and for \n$5,000, $1,600 or a little more.\n    The Chairman. Do you think--and maybe this is really almost \na rhetorical question, because it seems to me that this is the \nattitude of people who want to keep contributions even \nrelatively lower than they are now by dropping the amount that \npeople could contribute--that apparently in the 1970s, $1,000 \nwas kind of a level, a corruptible level, let's say. Above \nthat, you were worried about it. Does it really mean that today \nthe corruptible level is the $325?\n    Mr. Lewis. I am not so sure. I don't think we should \nlimit--we should bring it down. Maybe the level that we have \nmaybe should remain there.\n    Mr. Chairman, I must tell you, I do accept PAC money, and I \ndon't feel beholden to any organization or any PAC that I \nreceive dollars from. And, as my colleague from New York \nsuggested, money is money. You have little people pooling their \nresources. It may be a group of janitors coming together, \nworking in a union, a group of businesspeople. But money is \nmoney.\n    The Chairman. And, of course, the key is to disclose it; \nand that was the first and the basic principle of our current \ncampaign finance.\n    Mr. Lewis. And we must continue to disclose all our \ncontributions.\n    The Chairman. And I would just refer to you, and I will use \nyour testimony as an example, the Wall Street Journal today has \na very interesting editorial. It is titled, The Man Who Ruined \nPolitics, and it has a picture of Fred Wertheimer, and an \neditorial about their view on the way in which campaigns should \nbe run.\n    Mr. Gutierrez, I read your--and we are going to visit over \nlunch a couple times. The idea--when you listen to the \nstructure initially, it sounds, frankly, somewhat Rube Goldberg \nand rather complicated. But when you take a step back and look \nat it fundamentally, basically what you are saying is that if \npeople are so itchy and anxious to participate in the system \nand it is above a fixed level and they are willing to pay a tax \nfor it, then that will help money come into the system, and we \ncan use it.\n    Kind of like a gas guzzler tax. If you want the big car and \nif you want to be seen in the neighborhood, then you've got to \npay for it with a gas guzzler tax. Is that a fair analogy of \nthe way you are looking at where you are going to get some \nmoney with this tax on PACs?\n    Mr. Gutierrez. Well, Mr. Chairman, let me just say that \nthe--and we got this from the Democratic side, from the DCCC, \nthe information. They said that the average candidate received \n$50,000 in PAC contributions and that approximately $30,000 of \nthat $50,000 was above the $1,000 level. So that if we had my \nPACs tax on the basis of 2,593 candidates, at $11,888 per \ncandidate, taxing the overexpenditure, we have got about $30 \nmillion here in a pool."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    Now I think the important thing is that I kind of take a \nmiddle road with this PAC tax. I don't say we are going to get \nrid of them together. I say we use them as a tool and an \ninstrument and kind of rein them in as you suggest. If you want \nto give the big $5,000, you can still give it, but there is a \ntax that helps other people.\n    So I thought, look, it helps us because, remember, under my \nproposal as currently drafted--and I look forward to having \nthose lunches with you; we will make sure that no PAC picks up \nthe tab as we do that--that $200 or less in contributions get \nmaxed by this pool of money. That is not public money, because \nit comes from a tax on PACs. So it is not public money, and it \nwould encourage a candidate--and only the candidates who say I \nwill limit my campaign expenditures to $600,000 get to be in \nthe pool.\n    So I think it helps us do a couple of things. It says, go \nout and raise $200 and less contributions, and you are going to \nget matched by those contributions. And if the candidate spends \na whole bunch of money, as in your imagery that you gave us, if \nyou got that big old Cadillac out there, right, and you got the \nmillion dollar campaign, it gets taxed to help the--maybe the \nguy driving the--I am trying to think of the Saturn, because I \nwant to mention an American car.\n    The Chairman. There you go. And the other thing I like \nabout it is that it shows some creative thinking in terms of \nlooking for sources of money that could be utilized in the \nsystem that doesn't automatically go to the Treasury and \nutilize taxpayer dollars.\n    Mr. Gutierrez. One other suggestion, Mr. Chairman, and you \nknow you were very helpful in getting my proposal for three \nmonths before and for the franking, and if we could like look \nat--I know it doesn't deal specifically, but since I have you \nright here in front of me, if we could get that----\n    The Chairman. You can go out of the box.\n    Mr. Gutierrez. Another suggestion is if we could get that \npermanently as we discuss campaign finance reform so it is part \nof the mix.\n    The Chairman. I tell the gentleman from Washington that he \nis new to politics and new to the House and part of the new \nMajority. One of the things we have done around here is we have \nbroken most of the mold about what people think we would or \nwould not do.\n    As Chairman of this Committee, I am not inclined to create \na system that favors incumbents beyond whatever an inherent \nadvantage to an incumbent might be. There are some inherent \ndisadvantages to being an incumbent, one being you have a \nvoting record. But there are a number of noninherent advantages \nto incumbency currently in the structure, and I think those are \nthe ones you are focusing on. I have no interest in \nperpetuating noninherent advantages to incumbency. So we have \nalready broken some molds that we have done and some packages \nthat we have put together, and I look forward to working with \nyou in that area.\n    Mr. Dickey, you talked about PACs being primarily a \nperceptive problem rather than a realistic problem. PAC \nproponents would argue I think to a certain extent that what \nPACs have done is brought people into the system through \neducation and involvement "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","and perhaps even stimulated interest in elections through that \neducation and through the shared contributions they might make.\n    Do you have any feeling about whether, if you didn't allow \nPACs to participate, the dollars that the individuals now give \nthrough the PAC system would flow into the political system \nwithout PACs, or would there be possibly a diminishing of \nparticipation?\n    Mrs. Maloney's concern is that we want to try to keep those \npeople involved in the system, and if you do away with PACs, do \nyou think the dollars and the individuals involved would move \nto another venue or avenue, or would they perhaps not be \ninvolved?\n    Mr. Dickey. I think they would evaporate; some of them \nwould. Maybe a substantial percentage would evaporate at first, \nbecause most of the people I talk to that give to PACs don't \nfeel they have any access to decision-making at all. They feel \nthat lobbyists have their own agenda, their own politics is \ngoing on and they are outside of the picture and they give to \nthe PACs to keep their jobs or to buy a little peace. I think \nit would be up to us to find those people and get back with \nthem and try to bring them into the system.\n    One other thing, if we are trying to make better decisions \nin government, that is why it is important to go to the \nindividuals and ask them for their support and when you ask \nthem for their support and they say oh, no, I wouldn't dare \nsupport you because of so and so, and so and so, you are \ngetting an opinion. Or yes, I am going to give this to you \nbecause of your opinion. Individual opinions collectively makes \na stronger rope to carry our government with.\n    The Chairman. I guess my response would be why aren't PACs \nindividual connections delivered collectively, but we will \npursue that.\n    Mr. Gilchrest, when you talk about 100 percent of your \ncontributions coming from people who live in the district, what \nrole do you envision or believe political parties should play \nin that scenario? Would it be the political party helping you \nto structure those individual contributions, or would it be the \npolitical party could be involved through in-kind contribution, \nor would you prefer political parties not be involved, and \ncould that be why you focus on individuals only.\n    Mr. Gilchrest. We have, in my case, chosen not to take any \nparty money, national party, State party. I do think, and I \nwant to agree with Jay and some of the others, that it really \ndoes--we can't put aside the individual potential for creating \nand stimulating initiative on the part of the voters to \nparticipate in the political system. That is, in my mind, \ninfinitely more important than all the dollars you could \ncollect.\n    If people feel that they are attached to a candidate or a \nrepresentative then they are going to come out. And it is the \nresponsibility of the candidate and the elected official to do \nthat. I have no qualms with putting that aside.\n    If the State political party, Democrat or Republican, \nwanted to participate through the existing laws right now, no \nmore, but through existing laws to contribute to campaigns, I \nwould accept that. I think I would also accept on the national \nlevel the Democrat or the Republican Party through existing \nlaws as far as what they contribute to an individual candidate."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    One other comment. As far as the $1,000 contribution, I \nwouldn't change what individuals can give as well. And I \nrealize $1,000 doesn't go as far as it used to go.\n    The Chairman. We are going to have a hearing on the role of \npolitical parties. Some of us think that political parties are \nunique institutions in the system. They are the only ones who \nrecruit candidates and attempt to get them elected and also \nprogram public policy. I think all of those happen to be \nimportant functions and they are the only institutions that \nperform all three of them. Others are involved in other aspects \nof it----\n    Mr. Gilchrest. Although, Mr. Chairman, I wasn't recruited \nnor drafted. I sort of dropped out of the sky on the poor \nRepublican.\n    The Chairman. I understand that, and the gentleman has a \nfascinating story. And I think our job is not to pass \nlegislation on unique individual instances, but look at the \nlarger collective.\n    In terms of the question that Mr. Fazio posed about if in \nfact you favor smaller dollar amounts in the system, what about \nthe time spent on raising those smaller dollar amounts, as he \ncalled it, ``dialing for dollars?'' I think there is a \ndifference in terms of where you get dollars; not just how \nmuch.\n    I think one of the concerns is that in the current system \nyou get more dollars faster staying away from your district \nmost often than you do by coming to your district. You can go \nto large urban centers where dollars are given in concentrated \nevents.\n    Mr. Gilchrest talked about 100 percent, which I think has \nsome constitutional problems; Mrs. Maloney talked about 75 \npercent. I think we have to go back to the criteria that \nBuckley v. Valeo established, I think is a useful one as we go \nthrough this pursuit, and that is does it assist us in dealing \nwith either corruption or the appearance of corruption in the \nway in which we focus on the parameters of givers and giving.\n    It seems to me that if we focus in terms of creating some \nkind of a system that focuses more on individuals who could \nparticipate in the process; that is in district, that the time \nspent interacting with people in the district wouldn't \nnecessarily be seen as time wasted by most people, because \nafter all, you are interacting with those people who you are \nsupposed to represent.\n    The fact you tend to represent people outside your district \nas well, constituents are the determiners of whether or not you \nreturn to office by virtue of being able to vote for you.\n    Mr. Dickey. Mr. Chairman, I want to draw an analogy to the \nWal-Mart system that has been so successful in merchandising. \nThere was a definite turn of events, as I am told, when they \nwent to their associates and said you give us your ideas. You \nare the ones who are actually, the rubber is hitting the road \nwith you, we are here in an ivory tower, our ideas don't seem \nto work. What happened was Wal-Mart started saving money, they \nhad innovations, they got an enormous number of ideas and \nsupport and structure from that experience.\n    I don't want to bore this panel with this point, but I want \nto say that we are trying to get better decisions, we are \ntrying to create a better working government. Why in the world \nare we trying to ignore the very people who come in contact \nwith the mistakes and they can see ideas better if we set up a \nsystem where we are going "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","to them and asking them for their money, whatever it might be, we are \ngoing to get that strength of suggestions and creativity from \nthem by the very system of raising money.\n    Then we say the time we spend raising money is making our \nwhole government better, and we turn this thing around so that \nwe are on the flip side, rather than saying it takes so much \ntime to raise money, which is your point; that if we get to the \nbottom of it and bring it up, we will be a lot better off.\n    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for his observation.\n    Thank you.\n    Mr. Lewis. The impression should not be left that money \nfrom Political Action Committees is somehow outside, that it is \nforeign, that it is not connected to the local district or to \nthat State or to that indigenous community. When you get money \nfrom a political action Committee, they may be based in \nWashington or New York or California. It is that recommendation \nof the people in that district, that city or State or county, \nand many of those people have contributed, participated in that \npool. So we shouldn't look at PACs as something that is foreign \nor something that is strange or weird about it. I think we have \nan obligation to say these people have a right to pool in \nresources to have the greatest impact.\n    The Chairman. They currently are legally allowed to do so.\n    I want to thank the panel and the Members for indulging the \nChairman in trying to get to some basic concerns.\n    The gentleman from Ohio might want to inquire."
"ney","Mr. Ney","hoyer","Mr. Hoyer","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    I have a quick question. I am sorry I arrived late. I had \nsomething else I was required to be at.\n    Everybody has a story to tell. I defeated a former Chairman \nof this Committee against some incredible odds 15 years ago in \nthe Statehouse, and I had mixed opinions at that time about the \ngroups helping him and the groups helping me. He had a lot of \nPAC money and I had some PAC money, but I thought his were \nappropriate PACs and I thought mine were.\n    I think if you start to pick, I like this PAC but not that \nPAC, I have had campaigns since then; I have had labor money, \nsmall business PACs, whatever the issue is, and in the last \ncampaign I had more individual money. I think that is to each \ntheir own and how they view the system.\n    I don't think that if you say PACs, and the PAC came from \nWashington and if a farmer contributes or a labor union \ncontributes and money comes to Washington and they support you, \nit is still your local people, your local farmer, your local \nlabor person, your local businessperson. I think some of the \nPAC has been sent to a hyper-level here over the airwaves and \nhas been made worse than it is. I think it is how you approach, \ndo you call and say I want contributions. I think that type of \nthing is wrong.\n    Having said that, my real concern, and I would aim the \nquestions to the people who want to ban PACs, but ask the \npanelists, my concern for the future of politics if we set \ncampaign limits, which I have no problem to set limits, what \nabout the millionaires? This week we have heard so many \nmillionaire Members of Congress say let's stop the paychecks. I \nwould be willing to do that if "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","ney","Mr. Ney","they would stop their trust funds and all their money that they make on \nthe outside that is legal or inherited.\n    Sometimes it is easy to stand there and say let's stop the \npaychecks of the Members, or let's limit things, but what about \nthe millionaires. I have heard today from panelists money is \nmoney. My concern is that we have limits on the groups that can \ngive, we have limits on the individuals and that is fine, but \nwhat about the millionaires who can dump in as much money as \nthey want. So the people who want to ban PACs, where do you \nstand on the millionaires?\n    Mr. White. Let me address that, although as I said, I am \nnot, I haven't decided that I necessarily would want to ban \nPACs. I think we need to leave that to a group that is not \nnecessarily going to be biased the way we are because we have \nall been in the system. We talked a bit about the Supreme \nCourt, how it might change some of its rulings in the Buckley \nv. Valeo case.\n    I think we have to remember, one of the problems with the \ncampaign finance system we have now is that half of the system \nenacted in 1974 was ruled unconstitutional. I think it is \nincumbent upon us to think about the constitutionality of \nthings we do.\n    My view as a lawyer is it is unconstitutional to restrict \nwhat an individual can spend, and frankly, I think it is \nprobably also unconstitutional to restrict what an individual \ncan give. I think one of the things I would like to have a \ncommission look at is maybe whether maybe we should take all \nlimits off but just require full disclosure. I think that would \nbe one approach that maybe a commission with some academic \nempowerment and academic contributions to might be able to come \nup with a proposal like that better than we can.\n    One idea about the concept of spending limits, really when \nyou get down to it just about any limit on any kind of campaign \nfinance in any direction is always going to disfavor the \nchallenger, in my view, because you already have the incumbents \nthere with the advantages that incumbency has, and of course \nthe disadvantages, too.\n    For example, the $600,000 number that people talk about, it \njust so happens that if you look at the academic studies, \n$600,000 was the threshold point at which a challenger in 1994 \nstarted to become viable. So if you limit it at $600,000, you \nare basically already making it difficult for a challenger who \nisn't well-known to get beyond the threshold to where they can \nbe well-known.\n    We talk a lot about limiting campaign contributions to your \nown district. Well, you know, my Aunt Wanda lives in Indiana, \nso if I started my campaign solely from people in the district, \nI wouldn't have been able to get to the point where I could \nattract other contributions.\n    So I just think we have to look very carefully at all these \nlimitations, including the limitation on millionaires.\n    Mr. Dickey. I am not in favor of banning PACs, just PAC \ncontributions. The question of a millionaire if it favors the \nmillionaire, I am against that. In fact, then they could come \nin and control a race just by their own resources. I think that \nis a valid point."

"","","ney","Mr. Ney","    Mr. Lewis. Well, you know I support political action \nCommittees and I have reservations about limiting the amount of \nmoney that an individual can put into his or her own campaign.\n    Mr. Gilchrest. Mr. Ney, you talked about diversity, let \neach person do their own. I think we need biological diversity \nin our legislation to protect the environment.\n    Two, I came here to contribute my perspective and I realize \nall of us need to contribute a perspective to unlock this \nproblem. I would not mind a little bit of diversity depending \non what one district needs, another is different. But \ndiversity, to allow flexibility in a campaign finance reform \nbill I think would be the best way to go.\n    My last comment is about Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart might be good \nfor Arkansas, but Wal-Mart has used their dollars instead of \ncreating fine little communities and little stores, they have \npushed their way into communities that don't want them. I hope \nWal-Mart stays in Arkansas and they are prosperous, but they \nhave pushed their way around the country and into my district, \nand I think have gone too far. Campaign finance reform \nflexibility I think is the way to go, Mr. Chairman."
"ney","Mr. Ney","ney","Mr. Ney","    Let me make it clear, and I am not opposed to \nmillionaires, you ought to have people here of all backgrounds. \nThat is what makes a great Congress. I am just concerned that \nthey can buy elections if allowed unlimited amounts of money. \nSo I have no personal problem with millionaires. Maybe I would \nlike to be one. I won't be.\n    The Chairman. We are going to have a hearing on the \nindividual contributions, not just the amount, but the question \nof millionaires and the rest.\n    Ms. Dunn. Mr. Chairman, I don't want to start a second \nround of questions, but I tend to agree with those of you on \nthe panel who believe that people should have the right to \ncontribute through PACs. I also would say that equalizing what \nPACs can contribute with what an individual can give might be \nthe right way to go, but I think we are dealing with some very \nserious public perceptions.\n    I always take the deliberative approach. Let's strip away \nthe emotionalism and get to the real problem and the real \nanswer to the problem. I am not sure we can solve the whole \nproblem here, but it is true that the public perceives that we \nare sitting in Washington, D.C. picking up the phone and \ncalling PACs to get $5,000 donations at one whack instead of \ngetting home to talk to the individuals that we represent in \nthe Congress. That is a big problem.\n    We have got to figure out how to handle that. That is a \nproblem that may be solved by equalizing PACs, but I think it \nhas to be integrated program. The result that I would like to \nsee is one that would make the situation competitive. A lot of \ntimes, again, another public perception, and also a reality, is \nthat PACs give to a candidate, usually the incumbent, because \nof the almost guarantee that the incumbent will be reelected.\n    At one point a couple of years ago the reelection rate was \n94 percent. So a PAC is going to be very risk-taking oriented. \nIf they are going to give to a challenger, to an incumbent who \nwill be there to deal negatively, PACs may proceed with the \nissues that PACs are interested in."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","ney","Mr. Ney","    These are public perceptions and we have to figure out how \nto solve them. The answer is to make the field more \ncompetitive, make the incumbency less of a guarantee for \nreelection so that PACs can be truly a democratic \nrepresentation of a group of folks who want to give money to \nthe candidate who espouses an agenda that they approve of.\n    The Chairman. I thank the, gentlewoman.\n    I thank the panel once again.\n    As the next panel comes up, as an editorial comment, I \nwould refer you once again to ``The Man Who Ruined Politics'' \nin the Wall Street Journal, Fred Wertheimer, Common Cause.\n    In my personal opinion, this is one of the primary reasons \nthat the public perceives us the way they do and the distance \nbetween perception and reality.\n    Our second panel is a group of individuals who are \npartially from academia and through real world involvement have \nas a part of their activities the involvement with the question \nof political action Committees. Edward Crane is President of \nCATO; Steve Stockmeyer, is Executive Vice President of the \nNational Association of Business PACs; Joel Gora, Dean of the \nBrooklyn Law School, representing the American Civil Liberties \nUnion; Ken Parmelee, Vice President Government Affairs, Rural \nLetter Carriers Association; Steve Driesler, Vice President \nGovernment Affairs, National Association of Realtors.\n    I understand you all have pressing time engagements. I \nwould love to interact with you all afternoon, but if you have \nto leave, I understand you do.

"","","ney","Mr. Ney","    Mr. Crane. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    I congratulate you and the Speaker on your principled stand \non an issue that is not as popular as it should be at this \npoint in time. I appreciate the opportunity to address this \nCommittee.\n    I have a few brief points to make. First, when we talk \nabout PACs and their impact on the political process, we are \ntalking, in my view, about a nonproblem. It is true the media \ndon't like PACs but they tend to oppose any political force \nthat can bypass their filter. And it is true that certain \nMembers of Congress like to demagogue the issue when they go \nback to their district on white horses "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","ney","Mr. Ney","and say I voted to clean up the system, I voted against PACs, as though \nthat means something.\n    Mr. Chairman, the average PAC gives less than $1,000 to \nHouse candidates and less than $2,000 to Senate candidates. The \nimplication of those demagogues is that their colleagues will \nroll over and play dead or stand on their heads or do whatever \nthey are asked to for these modest contributions. There is \nabsolutely no evidence that that is the case.\n    In the debate over PACs rhetoric and reality are two \ndifferent things. PACs are a nonproblem. There is no evidence \nthat they do anything other than enhance the Democratic \nprocess, and in my view, it is insulting to Members of Congress \nto suggest otherwise.\n    Second, a Cato Institute study by Brad Smith cited in the \nWall Street Journal article the Chairman mentioned and earlier \nin the week by David Broder of the Washington Post, cites \nempirical research showing that the top three factors \ninfluencing the way a Congressman votes have nothing at all to \ndo with money. The first factor that influences votes is \nideology. Most Members get into politics because they have \nstrong views about various political issues, and that ideology \nstays with them through their careers.\n    The second factor is party agenda. We have a two-party \nsystem in America and the leadership constructs certain voting \nstrategies that affect the way Members vote.\n    The third is voter sentiment back home. Members are very \ninterested in what people back home in their districts think \nabout many issues. So those are the major factors that affect \nthe way Members vote and that has nothing to do with money.\n    That also brings up an ancillary point, because whatever \ninfluence PACs do have is more likely----\n    The Chairman. On the ancillary point, can you please hold \nit, because we have less than 10 minutes to get over and vote?\n    I was hoping I could get your testimony in before we have \nto go vote.\n    The Committee stands in temporary recess."

"","","ney","Mr. Ney","    The Chairman. The Committee will reconvene.\n    When we were last in session Mr. Crane was making an \nancillary point.\n    Mr. Crane. The point dealt with the reason why Members vote \nas they vote, and my point was that it had little to do with \nmoney, mostly with ideology, with party agenda and with voter \nsentiment, which brought up an ancillary point because whatever \ninfluence PACs do have is more likely to be a function of their \nability to mobilize their supporters than their ability to cut \na check for up to $5,000. That is why groups ranging from the \nChristian Coalition to the NRA to the labor unions to the NFIB \nget the attention that they do; because they deserve it.\n    They represent millions of Americans who happen to feel \nstrongly about certain issues. What could be wrong with that?\n    There is also the reality of PAC spending. There is plenty \nof competition for the attention of Members on any major issue \nand that competition often comes from PACs on the other side of \nthe issue. Furthermore, Members are free to reject PAC \ncontributions any "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","ney","Mr. Ney","time they want to and those contributions are, in any case, fully \ndisclosed.\n    If the case for restricting or eliminating PACs is \nultimately driven by a desire to get money out of politics, \nthen that case is based on a faulty assumption. As the Speaker \nsaid the other day, we are spending too little money on \npolitical campaigns, not too much.\n    For obvious reasons, it is in the electoral interest of \nincumbents to restrict spending and quiet the campaign. \nIncumbents invariably start the campaign with a huge advantage \nin name recognition; the less vibrant the campaign, the better \ntheir chances for reelection.\n    As Brad Smith's study makes clear, the more money spent in \na campaign, the better informed are the voters. Further, each \nadditional dollar has more benefit for the challenger than for \nthe incumbent.\n    So, Mr. Chairman, we can very well see what Congress was up \nto when it passed the 1974 Federal Election Campaign Act. \nPeople forget that part of that act that was struck down by the \nSupreme Court involved $70,000 spending limits for House races, \n$100,000 spending limits for Senate races, or 8 cents per \nvoter. What kind of disdain for the political process and \ncontempt for the American voter is involved with saying we will \nallow spending on campaigns up to 8 cents per voter?\n    Mr. Chairman, America spends more money today on yogurt \nthan on presidential campaigns, about $3.00 per eligible voter \non average in congressional races. How can $3.00 get Common \nCause so apoplectic? Brad Smith estimates we spend in every \ntwo-year election cycle somewhere between $7.50 and $10 per \neligible voter on all election campaigns, from dogcatcher to \nState legislature, to Congress, to the Presidency. So those who \nsuggest we are spending too much on campaigns are either \nignorant of the facts or pursuing some other agenda.\n    Finally, I would address the constitutional question of \nbanning PACs. The Chairman may be aware of Congressman J.S. \nHayworth's efforts to create a Constitutional Caucus in the \nHouse. There are now, as I understand it, approximately 100 \nMembers of that caucus, the purpose of which is to take \nseriously a Congressman's oath of office to uphold the \nConstitution.\n    We tend to think that oath is only taken by Supreme Court \nJustices and the President, but a Congressman is not supposed \nto vote for a piece of legislation that he or she feels is \nunconstitutional and should way the constitutionality of any \nissue before Congress before voting on it.\n    I would urge Members to consider the First Amendment before \nvoting on any legislation dealing with limiting or restricting \nPACs. Let me read briefly from the First Amendment. This is a \nshort amendment, as you know.\n    ``Congress shall make no law respecting establishment of \nreligion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or a bridging \nthe freedom of speech or the press or the right of the people \nto peaceably assemble and to petition the government for a \nredress of grievances.''\n    Mr. Chairman, free speech, the right of assembly and the \nright to petition Congress are sometimes interdependent. PACs \nare a excellent example of that fact."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","ney","Mr. Ney","    As the Supreme Court said in Buckley v. Valeo, dollars are \nnot stuffed into ballot boxes. The mediating factor that turns \nmoney into votes is speech. Advocacy cannot be proscribed \nbecause it is effective. It is estimated that some 12 million \nAmericans contribute about $12 a month to PACs each year. I \nthink that is a good thing. It is not a problem.\n    I would respectfully suggest that Congress lift \ncontribution limits for individuals and leave PACs alone. That \nwould be real reform in the interest of healthy and vibrant \ndemocracy.\n    Thank you very much.\n    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","ney","Mr. Ney","    Mr. Stockmeyer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon. \nThank you for this opportunity to testify.\n    This is the sixth time my group has been involved in \ntestimony before Congress on this issue but it is the only time \nthat two days of hearings have been devoted to PACs, with the \ndiversity and balance that has been brought to this. And we \nappreciate that very much, and we think you are doing a real \npublic service by examining this issue fully.\n    Authorized fully in the 1976 amendments to the Federal \nElection Campaign Act, PACs today are the virtual embodiment of \nAmerican pluralism and among the finest examples of Americans \nexercising their right to participate in the Nation's political \nprocess.\n    Currently, over 4,000 PACs represent almost as many \ndifferent interests, covering the total spectrum of citizen, \neconomic issue and philosophical spectrum. PACs have educated, \nmotivated and stimulated a rough estimated 12 million Americans \nin the political process voluntarily, and many of them for the \nvery first time.\n    In the last 20 years, PACs have become the premier way for \nAmericans of average means to band together and support the \nelection of candidates that they believe have their best \ninterests at heart. Through PACs like-minded citizens can have \nmore impact, be more involved in campaigns than they could \nacting alone. And far more than mere fund-raising and \ndispensing operations, PACs promote greater citizen \nparticipation in all elements of government through \npublications, seminars, vote drives and the like.\n    What is more, PACs are one of the few reforms of the 1970s, \nif not the only reform which has worked as intended and worked \nvery well. The PAC mechanism took what was under the table \nbefore and without limit brought it into the sunshine under \ntight limits and regulation.\n    Since their creation, there have been no significant abuses \nattributable to PACs. The sanctioning of PACs thus helped clean \nup a major part of the old discredited system of campaign \nfinance and continues to do so to this very day.\n    Because of all these positive achievements, we submit PACs \nare a very healthy part of the current system and should be \nconsidered a model reform which could be applied to other parts \nof the system. As long as we have private funding of campaigns, \nsomething that is certainly more desirable than taxpayer \nfunding and will always be guaranteed by the Constitution there \nnever will be a cleaner or better form of involvement than \npolitical action Committees.\n    Unfortunately, however, PACs have become the whipping boy \nof the campaign finance debate. For 20 years professional \nreform groups have engaged in McCarthy-like attacks on PACs and \nthis narrow view has been repeated by an unquestioning media. A \nrecent study showed that 98.4 percent of media coverage of PACs \nsince 1980 is negative, a higher negative percentage than those \nfor Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVay or retired Los Angeles \npolice detective Mark Fuhrman. These unprovoked attacks have \ncreated a false impression of corruption through innuendo, \nguilt by association and constant repetition."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","ney","Mr. Ney","    As the most fully disclosed part of the campaign system, \nPACs are obviously and easy targets for this kind of attack. \nThese attempts to smear PACs and the recipients of their \nsupport I believe are a part of a larger strategy to discredit \nall forms of private financing in order to build a case for \nforcing taxpayers to foot the bill.\n    We are concerned that these tactics have been so successful \nin creating a political imperative, although I believe a phony \none, that Members of the House have felt it necessary to \nintroduce a record number of anti-PAC bills this year. We would \nurge that this Committee pause before getting caught up in this \nhysteria to consider the positive role of PACs and the very \nnegative consequences of these proposals.\n    Campaign finance has always been uniquely plagued by \nunintended consequences. And here are some of the things that \nwould happen if we ban PACs or significantly reduce them: Broad \ncitizen participation in funding campaigns would be reduced and \nthe vital role that PACs have played to encourage involvement \nbeyond funding would be lost.\n    Number two, candidates would have to spend even more time \nraising funds than they do today, just the reverse of what \npeople would like to accomplish.\n    Three, an even greater advantage for and reliance on \nwealthy individuals would develop, and small minority groups \nwould be shut down, leading to domination by the larger more \nwell-heeled interests.\n    Four, campaign money would be less accountable as interests \nare forced to channel their support in largely undisclosed and \nunlimited ways. Voter communication and education would also \nsuffer.\n    We think we should also consider the constitutional grounds \nwhich others will go into about the illegality under the \nConstitution of bank PACs. If it is the appearance of influence \npeddling that Congress seeks to correct, there are any number \nof remedial approaches the Committee should consider shy of \ntrampling on the rights of average Americans to associate for \npolitical expression.\n    Finally, we submit that there is almost nothing about the \nappearance problems of the current system that could not be \nsolved by the conduct of the Members of Congress themselves. \nThere is nothing that forces our representatives to raise more \nthan they need for their campaigns, to raise funds all year-\nround, or to solicit or accept funds from sources with business \nbefore their Committees.\n    If voluntary restraint is not sufficient, then the House \nshould pass mandatory restraints as a part of its ethics rules, \nas you are doing on gifts today. If the appearance problems are \nas severe as some suggest, then each Member needs to be part of \nthe solution by examining and restricting demand.\n    NABPAC believes there is a historic opportunity here to \npass some constructive reforms, whether it is through the \nimmediate work of this Committee or the broader agenda \nsuggested by the Speaker in his Blue Ribbon Commission."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","ney","Mr. Ney","    NABPAC supports both efforts. We think the challenge is \nrestoring public confidence and increasing participation in the \nsystem while very definitely protecting precious constitutional \nguarantees.\n    The Chairman. Thank you very much, Mr. Stockmeyer."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","ney","Mr. Ney","<DOC>\n                     STATEMENT OF JOEL GORA"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","ney","Mr. Ney","    Mr. Gora. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n    I am Joel Gora, Associate Dean and Professor of Law at \nBrooklyn Law School, and I am privileged to appear before you \ntoday on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union. I do \nbear some small responsibility for the fact we are all here \nthis afternoon and I couldn't be more proud, because Buckley v. \nValeo is a landmark of political freedom. The only problem is, \nthe Court didn't go quite far enough.\n    In that case the lawyers for the plaintiffs contended that \nthe campaign reforms of 1974 were anything but, that they were \nbad constitutional law because they cut to the core of the \nFirst Amendment, and they were bad political reform because \nthey would magnify the power of incumbency, increase dependence \non monied interests and stifle political opportunity. And I am \nafraid we were right.\n    In Buckley the Court ruled that any government restriction \nof political funding is a regulation of political speech \nsubject to the strictest scrutiny. The Court further ruled that \nlimitations on expenditures flatly violate the First Amendment.\n    Nothing can justify the government telling the people how \nmuch they can spend to promote their candidacies or their \ncauses; nothing. But the Court upheld contribution limits of \n$1,000 for individuals but $5,000 for political Committees \nbased upon the concern with corruption, and that ruling has \ninsured the two decades of frustration and unfairness that have \nensued.\n    With no limits on spending or on wealthy candidates, with \nindependent Committees free to speak on politics, with issue \ngroups and the media free to speak on politics without limit, \nand with less well-funded candidates hampered in their ability \nto raise money from family and friends, the stage was set for \nthe two factors that have dominated politics for the last 20 \nyears, the advantages of incumbency and the dependency on PACs.\n    The ACLU has long suggested that the way to solve these \nproblems is to expand political participation by providing \npublic financing for all legally qualified candidates and not \nto restrict contributions and expenditures which help groups \nand individuals communicate their messages.\n    And that brings me to PACs. PACs, of course, have become a \npolitical dirty word, but PACs reflect the broad spectrum of \ngroups that enrich our political life. Proposals to restrict or \nrepeal PAC activity, I think are both unconstitutional and \nunwise.\n    You have heard from Mr. Crane and Mr. Stockmeyer about the \nbroad overview of the role of PACs, but I think nothing was \nmore eloquent than Congressman Lewis' testimony this morning \nwhen he indicated the two things about PACs that the ACLU has \ntried to say: Number one, they do embody political speech and \nassociation; and number two, they are particularly important, \nmany of them, to sparking new candidacies from divergent \nmembers of our "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","ney","Mr. Ney","community, new and different voices and not the ones that are \ntraditionally heard.\n    So efforts to limit or ban PAC contributions, to restrict \nthe amount of money that candidates can spend based on PAC \ncontributions, to ban out-of-State PAC contributions all \nviolate these principles of political freedom, of First \nAmendment rights and of political reform.\n    There is a way out of this morass that the campaign reforms \nof two decades ago have caused. The way is the path that the \nFramers of the First Amendment charted for us a long time ago. \nThe First Amendment answer to bad or corrupt or excessive or \noverinflated speech is more speech, publicly funded, privately \nfunded, more speech, rather than enforced silence coerced by \nlaw.\n    And the elements of this time-honored approach under the \nFirst Amendment are clear: Number one, raise individual \ncontributions. Let Aunt Wanda write an even bigger check to \nRepresentative White. That alone would reduce the reliance on \nPACs and increase political freedom. Give a modest tax credit \nfor political contributions. I think that was once in our law. \nI took it a time or two, and it was a pleasure to contribute \nand get a tax credit at the same time.\n    Third, public and effective disclosure of large \ncontributions leads to the democratic remedy for special \ninterests. Let the people decide who is too cozy with those \nspecial interests.\n    And finally, provide subsidies and benefits, perhaps the \nfree frank, reduced mail rates, but do it on an evenhanded \nbasis, not just for established candidates, not just for \nRepublicans and Democrats.\n    I am intrigued by the idea of a bipartisan Blue Ribbon \nCommission that will look into these difficult issues. I notice \nyou are supposed to have eight Republicans and eight Democrats. \nWhere is the Socialist Workers Party representative, let alone \nthe Libertarian Party, or all of the other third and \nindependent parties that enrich political life in America and \nwho have been sources for the new ideas that we have come to \naccept as commonplace.\n    Remember that leveling the playing field means that \nchallengers will have a better chance to defeat incumbents. No \none is born an incumbent. One of the collateral benefits of \nmaking it easier to raise money is that candidates will be able \nto spend less time raising money and more time raising issues.\n    The problem is the strategies I have outlined which have \none thing in common, expanding political opportunity without \nlimiting it, have really never been tried. What we said in the \nSupreme Court in Buckley 20 years ago was, allow unlimited \nexpenditures, unlimited contributions and have full disclosure \nso that the people can determine who is spending too much and \nwho is giving too much. That approach was not permitted by the \nresult in the Buckley case but it is the approach that is most \nconsistent with the one part of the Constitution that speaks \nspecifically to the issue of "

break,break,break,break,break
"","","ney","Mr. Ney","    Mr. Driesler. My name is Steve Driesler. I am senior Vice \nPresident of Government Affairs for the National Association of \nRealtors. I am here on behalf of the 750,000 Realtors \nnationwide who reside in literally every State, every \ncongressional district, every town, village and hamlet of this \ngreat country.\n    As part of my duties, I help administer the Realtors \nPolitical Action Committee, which is one of the largest and \nmost successful political action Committees in the country.\n    And I am here today to talk about citizenship and what PACs \ndo, and what our PAC in particular does to enhance and expand \ncitizens and citizenship and opportunity to participate in this \ngreat political system of ours.\n    I have heard the testimony today and you hear political \npundits and observers decry the lack of citizen involvement, \nthe lack of political participation. I think all of us were \ntaught from our very earliest days in Civics 101 that political \nactivity, political involvement is a highest responsibility of \na citizen and yet by almost any measure the level of political \ninvolvement in this country is at historical all-time lows.\n    Compared to most other industrial nations in the world, we \nrank low in all indices, such as voting participation, simply \ngoing to the polls on election day to help determine who is \ngoing to lead us at a local, State or national level. We have a \ncitizenship that is woefully inadequately informed about their \npublic officials and about the great issues of the day.\n    Fewer than a third of most citizens can name their Members \nof Congress, much less tell you how they vote on key issues \nthat affect them, their business, their personal lives. We \ndecry the lack of involvement of volunteers that come to work \nin political campaigns. We talk about that campaigns have \nbecome too much focused on personalities and not enough focused \non discussion of issues.\n    We have heard even here today people talking about the \nperception of undue influence that large contributors have in \nthe political system of the so-called ``fat cats'' who can give \nof their own wealth either to finance their own campaigns or to \nsupport other candidates.\n    Let me tell you how the Realtors Political Action Committee \nhelps address and eliminate many of these problems that are \naffecting us today. Let's talk about citizen involvement.\n    Every year, our PAC involves over 140,000 Realtors \nnationwide in getting them to write a check; a small check. Our \naverage contribution during the last election cycle was $26.76 \ncents, less than $28 per member--not fat cats, not big \ncontributors--less than $28 per member.\n    We have a special program called ``Opportunity Race \nPrograms'' designed to get our members actively involved in \ncandidates on behalf of candidates of their choice. We do this \nby informing them how these candidates stand on the key issues \nof the day of importance to realtors and homeowners and private \nproperty rights."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","ney","Mr. Ney","    In the last election cycle in 1994, these opportunity races \ninvolved over 22 percent of our membership, approximately \n150,000 members in 66 congressional districts, got these people \ninvolved in political campaigns that they would not have \notherwise, in most instances, been involved in had it not been \nfor our PAC involvement.\n    Recently, our PAC has shifted substantial amounts of its \nresources to what we call Issues Advocacy Campaigns and away \nfrom direct contributions. What is an issue advocacy campaign?\n    When we have an issue that is of concern to our members, be \nit at State, local or Federal level, we spend those dollars \nraised through the RPAC fund-raising mechanism to educate not \nonly our members but to educate the general public, to educate \npolicymakers, on our views.\n    For example, an issue that is now being hotly debated on \nthe campaign trails and that is the overhaul of the Nation's \nTax Code and what that might mean in terms of elimination of \nmortgage interest deduction, State and local property tax \ndeduction, what that can mean to homeowners, the value of their \nhouse, the affordability of housing, the housing opportunities \nin America.\n    The national RPAC trustees have spent over $350,000 this \nyear on that issue alone. They just recently, last week, at \ntheir national trustees' meeting voted to spend another \n$300,000 to carry this campaign forward through the 1996 \ncongressional and presidential campaigns.\n    All of this goes to raise voter awareness of key issues, it \ngoes to involve our members politically in campaigns. We have a \ncampaign to get out there to help encourage our members to run \nfor Congress, to run for State legislature, to run for school \nboard and to get other Realtors involved in helping these \npeople. All this helps increase citizenship, political \ninvolvement in this country.\n    I want to conclude by responding to one question you asked \nthe earlier panel, Mr. Chairman. If PACs were to go away \ntomorrow, would we still see that level of involvement? Would \nwe still see that $3.15 million that RPAC raises and \ncollectively spends in an election cycle?\n    Would we still see that in the system? No.\n    We have tried getting our members involved in direct giving \nand we have not been able to get the level of success that we \nhave been able to do to get them to write the $25, $26 check to \ntheir PAC.\n    So by restricting PACs, you are going to restrict citizen \ninvolvement in this country, and I don't think that is a good \nthing for the American political system.\n    The Chairman.

break,break,break,break,break
"","","ney","Mr. Ney","    Mr. Parmelee. Chairman Thomas, Congressman Fazio, good \nafternoon. My name is Ken Parmelee, I am the Vice President of \nthe National Rural Letter Carriers' Association, an 87,000 \nmember postal union that has maintained a political action \nCommittee for a number of years.\n    Unfortunately, today the news media and the public, \nincluding our membership, is very critical of PACs because it \nis perceived that we represent special interests. There is a \nperception that large individual contributors are cleaner or \nbetter than PAC contributions.\n    This I believe is a false premise. Individual large \ncontributors have special interests, too. I believe it was the \ncartoon strip POGO which said: We have found the enemy and he \nis us.\n    In fact, virtually every American has some kind of a \nspecial interest, and if you take large contributors, they may \nnot be as readily identifiable as money coming from a political \naction Committee, and that is because PACs have a principal \nentity which registers with the Clerk of the House and spells \nout what our legislative interests are.\n    But we at the Rural Letter Carriers believe that our \ncontributors become stakeholders in the election process. In \nthe case of Rural Letter Carriers, the average rural letter \ncarrier earns approximately $36,000 a year and we live \ngeographically all across the United States, except in the \nmajor cities.\n    Approximately, 12,000 of our members give an average of \n$23.00 a year to their PAC. Last year, about $1,000 of them \ngave as much as $100 and only 12 of them gave over $200. Our \nPAC is truly a pool of small donations from our members.\n    Rural letter carriers live in about 23,000 zip codes across \nthe United States. That is just about half the zip codes in the \ncountry; 8,000 zip codes are represented by contributions to \nour political action Committee. On the other hand, if we take--\nand I don't have current election figures, but I have them from \n1990--the top 10 zip codes in the United States gave 5 percent \nof all the individual contributions to Members of Congress and \nthe top 100 zip codes gave 21 percent of all the contributions, \nand one Manhattan zip code gave more individual contributions \nto campaigns than from each of 24 States.\n    So it is our belief that if you want to involve citizens in \nthis process and keep them involved in the process, you will \nnot ban PACs but keep us around, because as the other witnesses \nhave said, we get our members to participate in the process and \nour members live everywhere and they vote for you all and they \nget involved in your campaigns, and that is exactly what we \nwant them to do.\n    We don't think PACs are a problem. The perception of money \nis a problem; we all recognize that. That was the heart of the \n1974 reforms; the perception of money. But then I suspect the \nperception of money has been a problem since the beginning of \nthe republic.\n    We at the Rural Letter Carriers like the Speaker's \nproposal. I have not had a chance to study it in detail, but we \nthink the appointment of a commission of wise men and women to \nstudy the "

"fazio","Mr. Fazio","ney","Mr. Ney","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Since this is a panel of PAC partisans, let me see if I can \nask you to look at some of the issues that might amount to PAC \nreform within the community of PACs. I apologize I didn't hear \nall of the panels make all of their remarks.\n    We have in particularly the two groups represented to the \nleft of the audience very broad based organizations. We know, \nhowever, there are PACs that don't have mass membership \norganizations behind them or many contributors. Is there a way \nthat we could win the structure of reform of PACs, engender \nmore participation, more democracy with a small ``d,'' if that \nis a question about how contributions are made?\n    Are there ways we could take some of the rough edges off \nthe PAC attack by showing more clearly that these are \norganizations that represent thousands of people and not a \nhandful of people who have found another way to amplify what is \nprobably already for them a loud voice in the political process \nby making personal contributions as well?\n    I would be interested in your thoughts as it relates to the \noriginal purpose of PACs as it was created in the image of the \nClark McGregors of the world, who were looking to come up with \nan alternative to mass membership labor PACs, bringing white \ncollar workers or corporate middle management and senior \nmanagement people together in a political process, much like \nthese two organizations certainly have perpetuated.\n    Mr. Stockmeyer. The law as it stands today, in order to \nbecome a multi-candidate Committee, you have to have 50 people \ncontributing to your organization. So you start with that base. \nSome expansion on that, PAC probably it is not a bad idea to \nlook at. I think it is, however, a myth that there are a lot of \nPACs out there that only have a small number of people in them \nthat give major amounts of money to the PAC and then in turn to \ncandidates. I don't know any of those.\n    Our surveys of the corporate community shows that there are \n800 people on average per corporate PAC and their average \ncontributions are slightly less than $200 a year to the PAC. \nThere may be a handful of those, but I don't think it is a \nparticular problem.\n    But the idea that you should perhaps reward those that are \nbetter at stimulating people and getting them involved in \ncampaigns is not a bad concept. I am not sure how you might \nimplement that. I think it would have to be broad gradation.\n    Some of the proposals in early Congresses talked about fat \ncat PACs, which I don't think there are many of, and skinny cat \nPACs, that just weren't not based on evidence, but they \nprotected certain groups and penalized others. If you get down \nthat road, I think it is a slippery slope."

"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","tion by the average person and the more than average person. That is \ntheir genius. I think the major problem, assuming that the \nstructure of the law were to remain essentially unchanged, is a \nmatter of political education.\n    Mr. Driesler. The one comment that I would have is that \nwhile almost I think any standard of a skinny PAC or broad \nlevels of participation or low average dollar contribution, a \nRealtor PAC would fall into that framework, so I could sit \nthere and be very self-righteous and say, yes, yes, limit those \nPACs and we can go ahead and do our business the way we are \ndoing it now.\n    But prior to going with the National Association of \nRealtors, I was with another real estate trade association here \nin town. I also oversaw their PAC. They did not by the nature \nof the membership have as broad a base. They tended to \nrepresent companies as opposed to individuals and we had a much \nhigher dollar contribution. We had a much smaller number of \npeople contributing. We also had a much smaller overall total \ndollar amount in which to give.\n    I think it would be unfair to say that that PAC is somehow \nor other tainted or not viable, because I tend to agree with \nthe statement that participation, the problem of participation \nis solved by getting more people involved and that includes \npeople who are able to write $1,000, or even sometimes \nmultithousand-dollar checks to a PAC, as long as there is full \ndisclosure, which we would, as to where those contributions are \ncoming to and who those contributions are going to, I think \nthat is the real problem that needs to be addressed and solved \nby disclosure, which is exactly what the PAC reform of 1974 \ndid."
"fazio","Mr. Fazio","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Thank you.\n    The Chairman. I think I will use Mr. Crane as a foil since \nhe is not here.\n    In part of his testimony he indicated what contempt the \nlegislators earlier must have had for the process by virtue of \nthe structure that they created. I was going to engage him in \ndiscussing the fact that everybody who has been elected has \ncome through the process doesn't necessarily make them \ncontemptuous. They may be ignorant or naive about the \nconsequences of the decisions they made.\n    What we tried to remind people in the first hearing was \nthat we had a spurt of laws basically in the early 1970s, one \ncourt case, and then a series of decisions from a commission \nthat was created out of those laws, with virtually no changes \nsince then; a lot of stops and starts and attempts, but no \nfundamental reexamination.\n    What we are trying to do at this time, notwithstanding the \npressure to move product, which many of us believe to be \nimperfect in a number of ways, is to carry out a more \nfundamental examination of what went on in the 1970s, so that \nwe don't create those, as Mr. Stockmeyer said, unintended \nconsequences.\n    When you began looking at the way in which individual \ncontributions relate to individuals who are part of \npartnerships which get counted if they contribute to the \npartnership, back toward the individual contribution, but that \nif they had made it through a PAC, it doesn't count toward the \nindividual contribution, it creates a rather mine field of when \nand how and through which structure "

"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","you contribute. I don't think it was through contempt. I just don't \nthink folks understood what they were doing.\n    Mr. Driesler, you outlined the activity of the Realtors \nPAC, and I said earlier that I thought political parties were \nrelatively unique institutions in that they carried on a series \nof activities that no other institution carried on, and I \ntalked about recruiting candidates for office and making sure \nthose candidates get elected and to program public policy.\n    In your outline of your PAC, talking about your issues \nthrust and recruiting candidates and helping to finance them \nsounds a lot like a political party. I was sitting here trying \nto go over my definition, and I said, wait a minute; there are \nseveral Members of Congress who were in fact realtors when they \nran for office, and several of them have indicated to me, \nnotwithstanding the fact that they were realtors, the realtors \ndid not contribute to their election, but to their opponents, \nwho happened to be incumbents.\n    I just use that for this segue. I still believe my \ndefinition is valid because I haven't seen too many situations \nwhere the Democrats help a Republican get elected or a \nRepublican helps a Democrat, or any other party structure."
"fazio","Mr. Fazio","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Only indirectly.\n    The Chairman. That goes back not to contempt, but ignorance \nand naivete. I have a real concern about the belief that many \npeople think political parties are super-PACs or PACs are mini-\nparties. I believe that neither is either.\n    Mr. Stockmeyer, when you went through your analysis of what \nwould happen in the system if we followed the wishes of some of \nour colleagues and did away with PACs, and you indicated there \nwould be fewer dollars, there would be more time spent trying \nto raise dollars, more reliance on the wealthy, less \naccountable in terms of the structure, education would suffer \nstructure, and my desire to respond to you at that time was \nonly if you keep the current structure, because what you have \ndone is shut down political parties which used to perform all \nof those functions. If you released political parties, it \nwouldn't necessarily produce the result that you have.\n    I guess what it does is caution us that if we are going to \nmake a change in one area, we had better understand it is going \nto have an influence in another.\n    I will make one more statement.\n    Mr. Gora, the appeal is always fundamentally exciting when \nsomeone tells me the First Amendment says, ``Congress shall \nmake no law.'' Yes, but Justice Holmes said you can't shout \nfire in a crowded theater if there is no fire. So from that \nabsolute position of the First Amendment, which is sometimes \ndifficult to defend, I don't know that I absolutely support \nsomebody's ability, not necessarily based upon any achievement \nthat occurred in their lifetime other than an accident of \nbirth, to be able to go into the political arena and blow out \nanybody else's ability to participate. There I am wrestling \nwith the question of yes, but, yes but, as we move through it.\n    Now, your point in Buckley, I think is more reinforced \ntoday about disclosure being the fundamental sunshine in the \nsystem, because technology allows us to make disclosure a real-\ntime part of "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","the campaigns more today than ever before. We just passed a bipartisan, \nwith no objection, reform in the statutes to allow the FEC to \nbegin electronic filing, and I think in a short time we will \nhave a real time campaign participation on the question of \ndisclosure.\n    But notwithstanding that, I still bump up against Justice \nHolmes' argument of not being able to shout fire in a crowded \ntheater when there is no fire.\n    Mr. Gora. You are correct; the First Amendment has not been \ninterpreted as absolutely protecting all utterances, written or \nspoken. On the other hand, where political speech is concerned, \nthe Court has given the First Amendment its most stringent \napplication. And so the words of the First Amendment are a \nspecial caution that of the various kinds of laws that threaten \nthe First Amendment right of expression, of communication, the \nones that we are to be most concerned with are those that \nemanate from Congress, and particularly those that form the \nrules of the political road.\n    Mr. Stockmeyer. Mr. Thomas, if I could comment on your \nquestion of what happened in the 1970s and about political \nparties.\n    I was around when the 1974 Act was passed, and shortly \nafter it took effect found myself trying to manage the National \nRepublican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm of House \nRepublicans under the new law. I found at that time most \neverybody, least of all incumbents, had no idea of what was in \nthat 1974 Act and were astounded when they came to us in the \n1976 election and said where is my big amount of money that I \nused to get from my campaign Committee. I am sorry; we can't \ngive it to you because the law treats us as no more than a \nsuper-PAC. That is unacceptable I think to the two-party system \nin this country or any number of party system, for that matter.\n    The party Committees are not special interests. The party \nCommittees are there for a broad range of purposes. Obviously, \nI am biased on this point, but I think the whole system would \nbe better off if the parties were stronger, were able to do \nmore.\n    I would take all their limits off, subject them to full \ndisclosure, and I think the system would be a lot better off if \nwe did that. I don't think that would stop PACs from trying to \ndo what they can do in their little narrow corners of the world \nor broad corners, but they should be encouraged as well.\n    But in many ways the parties have supplanted the law, the \npresidential campaigns are not as vigorous as they should be. \nThe 1974 Act is a failure and we really ought to examine it and \nconsider taking some of it off, not putting more of it on.\n    Why would we take a failed law and do more of it? It is \nbeyond me that we should move in the same direction that the \n1974 Act did.\n    The Chairman. Would I be pushing it if I referred to an \narticle in the Wall Street Journal today entitled ``The Man Who \nRuined Politics,'' which is an article about Fred Wertheimer \nand Common Cause and their view of a destroy-the-field-to-save-\nit-approach to campaign financing.\n    Does anyone want to respond to that general question; \nbecause otherwise I would go to the PACs and say this. \nNotwithstanding the statements that you have made, one of the \ncriticisms which I "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","think has a degree of concern, if it is valid, is the broader argument \nof what we have here, our diverse educational and informational \nstructures that allow us to bring more people into politics and \nallow for participation in politics through pooled dollars has \nlargely not been achieved. Rather, basically what we have in \nmost PACs are centralized check collecting agencies that are \nprimarily interested in influencing the system vis-a-vis \nassisting incumbents to remain in office.\n    I put this fairly harshly, and I guess the way I would ask \neach of you to respond is by asking have you found that your \nattempts to educate and inform folk satisfied you in terms of \nfulfilling the goals that you had about getting them involved \nin the system, or has it been as frustrating as to most other \nfolk trying to get your average person involved? Does the hook \nof participation either in the professional letter carriers or \nrealtors and the tie to the PAC which is part of their at least \nwork-a-day world--has that been a lever that you have found you \ncould use to get people more interested in the system?\n    Mr. Driesler. The answer is absolutely yes. Let me give you \nexamples of the two gentlemen who are sitting here today.\n    In your district, Mr. Thomas, we have 1,581 Realtors. We \nget 500 plus of those who donate to the PAC every year, a 31 \npercent participation rate. In Mr. Fazio's district, he has \nover 5,500 Realtors in his district; 2,300 plus donate to the \nPAC, over a 43 percent participation."
"fazio","Mr. Fazio","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    I just came out for in-district fund-raising.\n    Mr. Driesler. One of the things that we are most proud of \nis that our decision making is from the ground up. And you \ngentlemen both know because you have gone through the process, \nthe national PAC trustees don't ever originate a request. They \nrespond to, approve, deny, amend a request that originates in \nyour home congressional districts in your home State.\n    You have gone to those candidate interviews. They look at \nyour voting record and they choose to support you because you \nhave been right on issues that are important to those realtors \nback in those home congressional districts and home States. \nThey may choose, and in many instances have chosen, that even \nif a realtor runs that they not support them, not just because \nthey are a realtor, but because more fundamentally we believe \nthat it is important to get realtors involved, but we think it \nis important to support those people who believe in private \nproperty rights, who believe in homeownership opportunities, \nwho believe in the type of issues that you gentlemen espouse, \nand to make sure that people like you remain in Congress if you \nare there, and if you are not in Congress, to do everything we \ncan to get you there.\n    Our PAC was the fifth largest donor to challengers in open \nseats during this last election cycle. We habitually run about \nthat level. We put a lot of our resources into open seats and \ninto challenger seats. But yes, we do give a lot to incumbents, \nbut individuals give proportionately the same amount to \nincumbents as PACs do, because you are dealing with a known \nquantity, and as one person alluded to in the earlier panel, \nyou are dealing with an odds that heretofore have said 98 \npercent of you get reelected. Those odds have come down \nslightly in the last two election cycles, but it is "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","still 90-plus percent, which is a pretty good bet in any horse race. \nBut still, fundamentally, notwithstanding that, we look \nprimarily at issues, at voting records and what the realtors \nback home tell us who they want us to support and that makes \nthe determination.\n    The Chairman. The point I tried to make about comparing the \nrealtors to political parties was to point out that even if you \nemulate most of what a political party does, you can't do it \nbecause PACs are not mutually exclusive operations like \npolitical parties. Political parties are in fact unique \ninstitutions, and my definition survived even your expanded \nrole for PACs.\n    Mr. Driesler. And we would support expanded roles for \npolitical parties. We have been major donors to political \nparties in the belief that it is important to have a viable \ntwo-party system.\n    Mr. Parmelee. Mr. Chairman, in part, the reason that PACs, \nas individual as you so well pointed out before, end up \nsupporting so many incumbents is you develop a voting record. \nYou develop a history with the organization of how you deal \nwith that organization, and therefore the organizations tend to \ngo more towards incumbents.\n    But in open seats, we encourage our State leadership to \ninterview the candidates and to actually get involved, give \nthem a questionnaire and see where they stand on issues that \nare vital to us. And we also feel that those people who do give \nmoney to PACs really become stakeholders and really do care \nabout voting, frankly, more than our other members do.\n    Mr. Driesler. Let me add, we have over 200,000 of our \nmembers who have at some time given to the PAC. When we have an \nissue before Congress, we will typically send out a call to \naction. No doubt you have been recipients of some of those \ncalls and letters.\n    We have tracked the amount, the percentage response from \nthose who have given to the PAC versus those who have not, and \nit is like three and four times the level of people who are \nwilling to pick up the phone or get out their pen and pencil \nand write a Member of Congress or call them or send them a \ntelegram from people who have that stake hold because they have \ngiven to the PAC. We think that is an important correlation.\n    Now, it is what comes first; the chicken or the egg, and \nthat is hard to answer, but there is a clear correlation with \ntheir willingness to participate in other levels, including \nvoting, including working in the opportunity races, \nvolunteering their time, to the fact that they have given a \ndollar or $2.00 or $5.00 or whatever to the PAC versus that \nperson who has not given a nickel.\n    Mr. Stockmeyer. Mr. Chairman, let me add on this incumbency \npoint, the seeming bias of PACs toward incumbents, I think it \nis sort of a bum rap because almost every form of political \ngiving tends to favor incumbents. But one chart you might \nconsider having for another hearing is to measure the years \nwhere there is political volatility and opportunity and you \nwill find then the PAC percentages that go to nonincumbents \nincreases.\n    PACs are very heavily involved where there are marginal \nraces. Some PACs are on one side and some are on the other. But \nthey are in there. But that shouldn't--it is difficult for us \nto accept the idea that people would challenge our right to \ncome together, but it is even more abhorrent I think \nconstitutionally that anyone would "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","question how these people decided to express themselves politically \nthrough their fund-raising. I think that that is a fundamental \npoint that we forget. If a PAC organizes and decides to give \nall its money to incumbents, so what? That is their right.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Fazio."
"fazio","Mr. Fazio","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    I just wanted to comment, I am aware that the \ntwo PACs at the table do give to parties. Many don't and I \nthink that is up to each individual PAC to determine. But in \nthe last Congress one of the issues that slowed down the \nultimate resolution of the conference on campaign finance \nreform was with the elimination of soft money for the two \nparties, certainly the national Committees and the House \nCommittees.\n    It was the suggestion of some, including this Member, that \nwe be able to take more money from PACs to make up for--only a \nsmall amount, I am sure, of the shortfall that would have \noccurred with those party Committees. Even though we had only \nsuggested a modest increase in what PACs could give, and even \nthough those PACs would have been vastly reduced in their \nability to give to Members given the other aspects of the bill \nthat reduced the total amount of PACs that Members could take \ndollars from, we were unable to get support from any of the \noutside support groups for campaign finance reform for the \nconcept of giving more money to the parties. So they have not \nonly a concern about PACs generically, they have a concern \nabout giving more money from PACs to the parties, which is I \nthink one of the reasons why every time we attempt to legislate \nin this area we end up weakening the parties even more. I would \nhave hoped for more flexibility, but it didn't exist in the \nlast cycle.\n    Mr. Gora. If I might amplify on that point, one of the \npoints we have always tried to make as both a political science \nand a constitutional law point was that if you restrict \npeople's ability to use their resources to communicate their \nmessage in one way, they will try to do it in another way, and \nthat is perfectly understandable. But then you will have as \nskewed and imbalanced a system as you thought you were trying \nto create. That is the law of unintended consequences that we \nare talking about. That is why good political science and good \nconstitutional law come together in a way that says the right \nof candidates and PACs and issue groups and lobby groups and \nmedia groups are all the same right under the first amendment, \nto speak, to communicate, to use their resources essentially \nwithout limitation.\n    The Chairman. One comment on that, and I would like you to \nreact to it. It is in part taking off from what Mr. Fazio has \nsaid. I think there is some concern, and I would like some \nconstitutional reaction or rational political reaction to the \nargument about the movement of money in politics horizontally \nor vertically. One way money moves is vertically, the idea that \nif an individual contributes to a PAC, then the PAC is supposed \nto contribute to a candidate running for office. Also, if an \nindividual contributes to a party, then the party can \ncontribute to the candidates of that party, this is vertical \nmovement of money.\n    There is a concern about horizontal movement of money from \nindividuals to PACs and from PACs to parties, and then from \nparties to candidates, or from individuals or PACs to other \ncandidates who "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","are usually incumbents who then have leadership PACs of their own which \nthen contribute to other candidates running for office. There \nis some concern that the horizontal movement of money within \nthe system short circuits both individuals, PACs and political \nparties in the system.\n    Any reaction to that? Some people watching on television \nmight want to know what in the world is he talking about? I \nthink you folks do, and as we talk about it more, then people \nmight understand.\n    Mr. Driesler. The National Association of Realtors a number \nof years ago--we have been around this racetrack, too, on \ncampaign finance reform--are on record as having favored and \ncalled for the abolition of leadership PACs. Our national PAC \ntrustees a couple of years ago said, let's put our money where \nour mouth is, and we have voluntarily suspended giving money to \nleadership PACs for the very reasons you just so well \narticulated.\n    The political party issue has been a little bit difficult \nfor us; I will be honest with you. There are many within our \nassociation who feel that if we give to a party they may in \nfact give then to candidates that our Realtors wouldn't \nsupport, in fact may be opposing, and that that is somehow a \nnot wise use of the money. On the other hand, there are those \nwho feel that parties are important, that they serve a vital \ninterest of recruiting candidates, of helping get the message \nout, getting people involved, so we have been somewhat mixed.\n    We have reduced our level of party giving but we have not \neliminated it completely I guess in an effort to try to strike \na balance between those who feel we should be giving all our \nmoney either to candidates or to issues or to direct \ninvolvement as opposed to the horizontal transfer versus fill \nsome legitimate and valid need to support the major political \nparties.\n    The Chairman. Let me say that if you were looking at it in \nthe negative, the argument would be that people wouldn't want \nto move money horizontally because they would lose the \ninfluence, and the whole purpose of giving money is to \ninfluence, and why would you give money to somebody else to let \nthem influence when it is your money.\n    I think the positive and legitimate way is accountability, \nthe concern about being able to disclose and have disclosure \nmeans something in terms of where the money originated and \nwhere it went. I do believe and I do agree with the gentleman \nfrom California that when individuals or PACs contribute to \npolitical parties there is a way to structure for \naccountability and for disclosure that would be different from \nthe horizontal movement of money in the leadership PACs or \nother noninstitutional structured giving.\n    Thank you very much for your participation. We may be back \nto you; obviously we will for ideas, and this may lead to \nadditional hearings and we very much appreciate your input.\n    We have just heard from representatives of PACs and I \nthought it appropriate that in a discussion about PACs that \nalthough it is always valuable to hear from people who \nrepresent PACs, that we might ought to also have a panel of \npeople who are members of PACs and who are themselves \nparticipants in PACs.

"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Ms. Baylin. Chairman Thomas, Ranking Member Fazio, \nrespected Committee members, I am Adrienne Baylin. I am an \nemployee of Baltimore Gas & Electric Company. I come before you \ntoday as a supporter of political action Committees.\n    PACs are important to me as an individual. Our PAC has \nenabled me to make my contributions count. By recognizing \ncommon goals and interests, BGE employees and retirees have \nbanded together to voice our views to legislators, both to our \nMaryland delegation and on a national scale.\n    As an individual, I would not have supported candidates \nthroughout the United States. Small political contributions by \nan individual seem insignificant compared to the cost of a \npolitical campaign. By pooling resources, BGE PAC gives me a \nvoice while supporting the political process.\n    Contributing to a PAC is a very personal issue. The welfare \nof business itself is important to me. A less than favorable \nbusiness climate jeopardizes my livelihood. In the current \neconomic climate of cost cutting and downsizing, more and more \nbusinesses disappear. I want our PAC to support business \ninterests to broaden Maryland's economic base.\n    I have come to look forward to BGE PAC newsletters. Through \npublications and discussions, PACs have a definite impact on \nneutralizing voter apathy and informing each member. PAC \nmembers tend to get involved. This results in better \ngovernment.\n    Not all PAC issues conform to party values. My ideals tend \nto cross party lines. PACs are nonpartisan entities. They \nallocate funds based on voting record and an individual's view \nof issues. I feel this gives me the ability to support the best \nchoice for political office. As a PAC, we have argued support \nfor a candidate that expressed our collective viewpoint. PACs \nsupport the common goals, setting aside the interests of the \nindividuals for the benefit of the many, and that benefits all."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Mr. Kavanaugh. Thank you, Chairman and members of the \nCommittee. Thank you for inviting me here today.\n    I am John Kavanaugh and I am testifying on behalf of the \nNational Restaurant Association, the leading organization for \nthe U.S. food service industry. Our industry is made up of \nnearly 740,000 food service units throughout the United States.\n    I own Kavanaugh's Esquire Club in Madison, Wisconsin. We \nhave been in business for nearly 50 years. I grew up working in \nthe restaurant for my father. That started in 1947 and I bought \nthe restaurant from him in 1981. My son, now 23, is now working \nfor me, and I hope some day that he will own the restaurant, \ntoo.\n    Kavanaugh's Esquire Club sometimes is asked questions, what \nkind of business we are, because some people think that we are \nmaybe a private club. The Kavanaugh Esquire is a steak and \nseafood restaurant that serves lunch and dinner, seven days a \nweek. Our customers tend to be regulars, everyone from local \nresidents to a local Oscar Mayer meat packing plant, as well as \nmany politicians, State and local, that come to the restaurant \nto meet and eat.\n    When the phrase ``campaign finance'' hits the headlines, \npeople think that political corruption, high-stake campaign \ncontributions, and big ticket fund-raisers are appropriate. \nThey don't think of people like me. I am here today because I \nwould like to put another face on it, one that I think is truer \nto life even if it is not good for the headlines.\n    I am a regular contributor to the National Restaurant \nAssociation Political Action Committee and for the past two \nyears I have served as a PAC trustee, which means I have gotten \nmore involved in both fund-raising and deciding where to spend \nour money. It has given me a real feel for the way a good PAC \ndoes business and I am proud that we do it that way.\n    Our PAC is a significant PAC. Last election cycle, \nrestaurant owners contributed over $700,000 to the \nassociation's PAC. Nearly 60 percent of them contributed less \nthan a hundred dollars. These are not shadowy figures with deep \npockets, but they are people like me who have literally \ninvested their lives work in their restaurant and who want to \ncome together as an industry to impact on national politics.\n    We can be as different from each other as the Esquire Club \nis from McDonalds, but we share a lot of same concerns. We \nbelieve in a strong free enterprise system and getting rid of \nregulations that don't make sense, and keeping our taxes low so \nthat our capital can go back into our businesses. That is why \nthis PAC spends its money extremely diligently. Put simply, we \nsupport our supporters and we oppose those who oppose us."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Based on recommendations from local restaurateurs, we scour \nthe country early and often for promising challengers, both \nincumbents and nonincumbents. Last year, 45 percent of our \ncontributions went to challengers and not incumbents. That is a \nhigher proportion than the average PAC. In fact, it is a higher \nproportion than the general public contracts to nonincumbents. \nWe did that because we were dead serious about standing up for \nan industry that accounts for 9 million jobs and $290 billion \nin annual sales.\n    I tell you all this because we have nothing to hide at our \nPAC. It is a clean way of doing business, and like I said, I am \nproud of it. I don't kid myself that a donation to my PAC is \nnot going to make or break an election. It makes me part of the \ndemocratic process, so it is the easiest way for me to \nparticipate in the process on behalf of my industry that is my \nlivelihood.\n    I am at my restaurant six and a half days a week, usually \nworking 12-hour days. My main goal is keeping my customers \nhappy and keeping them coming back to see me. But because I \nknow Congress' decisions in Washington affect the way I operate \nmy restaurant in Madison, Wisconsin, I want to be involved at \nthe national level, too, and the PAC gives me a way to do this.\n    People say that PACs cut the average citizen out of the \nelectoral process. I am here to say the exact opposite. \nLiterally thousands of restaurant operators have been brought \ninto the electoral process by the National Restaurant \nAssociation Political Action Committee. As you know, the names \nof anyone contributing over $200 are available as a matter of \npublic record. We are happy to provide the names of all others, \ntoo. I can hardly think of a more open and responsible way to \nencourage participation in the democratic process.\n    The Chairman. Thank you."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Ms. Dietz. Good afternoon. I am Nancy Dietz, a seventh \ngrade math teacher at West Frederick Middle School in \nFrederick, Maryland. I have come to speak to you today because \nI believe that you should maintain my right to participate in \nthe political action Committee of the National Education \nAssociation.\n    As a teacher, my influence is not great. I do not often get \nthe opportunity to speak with Members of Congress. But it is \nimportant that you hear my message. That message is that you \nmust see to it that every child in the United States has an \nopportunity to learn. That opportunity often depends on you. \nYou make decisions that affect schools and teachers and \nchildren, and your decisions are a result of a political \nprocess that affects us all.\n    How can I take part in that process? How can I join the \ndebate? You do not often hear my voice, but you hear me because \nI can join with others like me to raise a collective voice in \nsupport of education. You hear the message of the NEA.\n    In my community of Frederick, Maryland, during the last \nelection over $40,000 was raised in six weeks in support of \ncandidates sympathetic to the interests of builders and other \nlocal businesses. It took the teachers of Frederick four years \nto raise $7,000 to support education. The teachers had $7,000 \nto carry the message of support for public education to the \nvoters.\n    Guess who won? At the national level, it is those big \ncorporations with great big blue chip names who raise money to \npay for advertisements and mailings. They have money, they have \na voice, and they are heard. Teachers don't have that kind of \nmoney. Teachers don't have that kind of money, but isn't it \nimportant that we have a voice? Isn't it only fair that my \ninterests be represented in the political process along with \nthose of large corporations? Through my individual \ncontributions to my local, State, and national PACs, I have \ninfluence. I am included. Please protect my right to be heard.\n    Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak to you."

Let me say briefly, I think it would be an \namendment that you would accept to your testimony that every \ntime you said ``corporation,'' you would say ``individuals in a \ncorporation,'' since clearly it is illegal for corporations to \nparticipate in Federal elections. It was the individuals in the \ncorporations.\n    Ms. Dietz. That was my intent.\n    The Chairman. Right.\n    Mr. Kincaid, how long have you been a firefighter?\n    Mr. Kincaid. Almost 17 years.\n    The Chairman. Thank you. Please proceed."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","<DOC>\n                   STATEMENT OF KEVIN KINCAID"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Mr. Kincaid. Mr. Chairman, Congressman Fazio, my name is \nKevin Kincaid, and I have been an active fire fighter/paramedic \nfor almost 17 years. I am currently a captain with the Fairfax \nCounty Fire and Rescue Department. I appear before you today to \nexplain why I participate in FIREPAC, the Fire Fighters' \nPolitical Action Committee, and to tell you why I believe that \nPACs are beneficial to the Nation's emergency response \npersonnel.\n    The decisions made by the United States Congress have an \nenormous impact on my life and the lives of all fire fighters. \nWhether the issue is assuring that the protective gear I wear \ninto a fire meets basic safety requirements or assuring that my \npension is secure, the votes cast by Members of Congress \ndirectly impact my ability to do my job and protect the public \nsafety.\n    I believe that I have a right to support candidates for \noffice who support fire fighters. Contributing to the fire \nfighters PAC is a way that I do that. All money raised by our \nPAC comes from voluntary contributions made by the Nation's \nprofessional fire fighters. The typical donation is around $25. \nI view political action Committees as a way for the average \nAmerican to participate in our Nation's political process. The \nunfortunate reality is that wealthy people always have and \nalways will be able to influence elections with their money.\n    PACs are the mechanism for fire fighters and other middle-\nincome Americans to attempt to level the playing field.\n    Mr. Chairman, I don't know too many fire fighters who are \nin a position to sit down and write a check for $1,000. In \nfact, I don't know any fire fighters who can do that. But by \npooling the small contributions of fire fighters across the \ncountry, the fire fighters' PAC is able to assist candidates \nwho are willing to stand up for us and we were able to offset \nsome of the financial advantages of candidates backed by those \nwho oppose us.\n    It is a simple question of fairness. Upper-income people \ncan raise $5,000 for a candidate who represents their interests \nby asking five friends to donate $1,000 each, but to raise \n$5,000 for a candidate who represents our interests, we must \nask at least 200 fire fighters to donate $25 each to our PAC.\n    I firmly believe that banning PACs would unable the \nwealthiest Americans and large corporations to dominate the \npolitical process. Candidates who stand up for working \nAmericans would simply not be able to compete. In short, PACs \nare the way that the voices of typical Americans get heard by \nour Nation's policymakers."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Large donations--whether from an individual or a PAC--come \nwith an unstated message attached. When the fire fighters' PAC \ncontributes to a candidate, it is understood that the support \nis being provided because the candidate supports fire fighter \nissues. I want my donations to carry a message and the fire \nfighters' PAC makes that possible.\n    In recent years there has been a great deal of rhetoric \nabout the detriments of PACs on our political system. I hear \nthese comments on radio and read about them in newspaper \ncolumns, and I even hear them echoed around the fire stations. \nI would like to share my thoughts with you on why I find these \narguments misguided.\n    First, some people argue that PAC contributions are little \nmore than bribes. Members of Congress, the argument goes, vote \nfor legislation contrary to the public interest simply because \ntheir vote will be rewarded with a campaign contribution. Aside \nfrom being insulting to Members of Congress, this argument \nmisunderstands the relationship between voting and PAC \ndonations.\n    Members of Congress do not support fire fighter issues \nbecause they receive support from the fire fighters PAC. \nMembers of Congress receive support from us because they \nsupport fire fighter issues.\n    It will come as no surprise to the members of this \nCommittee that the fire fighters' PAC has been a strong \nsupporter of Representative Curt Weldon, Mr. Fire Service in \nthe United States Congress, but our support did not influence \nhis views of fire fighters. Curt Weldon was the champion of \nfire fighters long before coming to Congress. The only thing \nthat the fire fighters' PAC contributions did was help this \nchampion of fire fighters win a seat in Congress.\n    A second argument used against PACs is that they comprise \nsome sort of secret cabal, a mysterious group of people behind \nclosed doors to manipulate the political process for their own \nselfish needs.\n    In reality, PACs are the most open and heavily regulated \nentities in existence. Every PAC donation expenditure is \nreported to the Federal Election Commission and available for \npublic review, and the methods PACs use to raise money are \nrestricted by Federal law and closely regulated.\n    I find it significant that despite the negative perception \nof PACs, campaign finance scandals in recent years almost never \ninvolve PACs. The Keating Five controversy, for example, dealt \nwith contributions from individuals. The truth is, PACs are the \ncleanest, most accountable, and most open aspects of campaign \nfinance ever developed, and banning PACs would surely make \ncampaign finance less ethical than it is today.\n    Finally, the argument has been made that PACs are \ndetrimental because they advance special interests. Mr. \nChairman, allow me to tell you a few things about my job.\n    Fire fighting is the Nation's most dangerous profession. \nEvery day fire fighters put their lives on the line to protect \nthe lives and property of our fellow Americans. We are a very \nspecial group of people, and we have legitimate legislative \ninterests. If that makes me a special interest, so be it."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    I am glad that there is a PAC out there that supports me \nand one that I can support with my voluntary contributions.\n    I don't doubt that there are problems with the way that \ncampaigns in this country are financed. It seems to me that too \nmuch money is spent campaigning, and there may be a way to \nreduce the overall influence of money on the political process. \nBut whatever problems exist, PACs are not one of them.\n    As this Committee considers this issue, I leave you with a \nplea on behalf of myself and my fellow firefighters. Please \ndon't take away our ability to participate in the political \nprocess, and please don't destroy my political action \nCommittee.\n    Thank you.\n    The Chairman. Thank you."

"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    The Chairman. All of you expressed the desire and \ninvolvement in pooling your funds for some kind of a combined \nimpact through your PAC. Can you give me instances, either \nbecause of your ability to contribute some time or your \ninclination to be involved in any kind of educational or \ninformational activity surrounding your PAC, or have you only \nbeen able to limit your participation in terms of dollars and \ncents in the PAC?\n    Ms. Dietz. Educating the public in terms of issues?\n    The Chairman. If you have a PAC, and you are part of that \nPAC, your testimony primarily focused on the contributions that \nare important to you through that PAC.\n    Have any of you been able to contribute time or been \ninvolved in any kind of educational or informational activity \nfocused by your PAC or initiated by your PAC to assist in more \nthan just putting dollars into the political system?\n    Ms. Dietz. On a local level, during the last election, I \norganized the volunteers through my PAC to drop literature, to \nmake phone calls. We developed a list of candidates to deliver \nat polls that supported educational issues. Is that what you \nmean?\n    The Chairman. Did you get people involved that hadn't been \ninvolved in the political process before?\n    Ms. Dietz. Yes. Teachers, you mean? Yes.\n    The Chairman. Were they contributors to the PAC prior to \nbeing involved?\n    Ms. Dietz. I can't answer that for sure. It is my sense \nthat not all of them were because our contributions were lower \nthe year before. We had a lot more participation--mostly \nbecause of the leadership, the people who were directing what \nwas going on, and because we had the PAC drive. We also had a \nlot of other activities----\n    The Chairman. So it is your impression after the \nparticipation that there is a higher participation in political \ngiving through the PAC than before?\n    Ms. Dietz. I guess the PAC drive is one way we go to our \nmembers and say, you can contribute this way. Some of them \nchoose not to. Some contribute time as a result of that \nrequest. Some say, I would rather not give money, but I would \nmake phone calls. So yes, it does stimulate that kind of \nactivity, and that is what we look for.\n    Mr. Kincaid. The fire fighters make a great deal of effort \non a local and a national level to educate our members on \npolitical education. We hold legislative conferences in \ndifferent arenas to bring new members in and educate them in \nthe political process and the fire fighters' needs.\n    Mr. Kavanaugh. In Wisconsin, I belong to the Wisconsin \nRestaurant Association, and in a lot of States, the National \nRestaurant Association is taking affiliations of the State \nassociations to become one unit. Wisconsin is one of the last \nStates to join as a member of both automatically. But in \nWisconsin at all our monthly meetings, and we have 17 chapters \naround the State, we have political forums and we bring in \ncandidates, whether national or local candidates, to bring up \nissues and we do mailings out of political questions that bring \nall the members, which in Wisconsin is 6,000 members to the \nState association, so that they are aware of all the political \nthings that are happening. So they are becoming more politi"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","cally active and that is what you want. You don't want just their \nmoney. You want their vote and their support.\n    Ms. Baylin. I think any political action Committee that \nputs out any literature automatically starts discussions \namongst coworkers, friends, family, because there are issues \nthat come out, interesting articles that come up, things that \nwarrant discussion, and I think this tends to get people more \ninvolved and starts to spread involvement at a grass-roots \nlevel.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Fazio."
"fazio","Mr. Fazio","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Mr. Chairman, if you would permit me, given the \nfact that we have a vote on, I have three questions. I will \nread them slowly. I would be interested in your responding to \nany of them that move you.\n    First of all, how do you feel about the process of \nselecting the candidates you contribute to? Do you feel you are \ninvolved? Do you feel you have input? What do you do to solicit \nthe grass-roots of your PAC, in other words, to be involved in \nthe process of actually deciding who you are going to support? \nHow do you sell your, and let's stipulate to this, increasingly \ncynical colleagues about the value of participating when in \nfact with corporate downsizing and everything else that is \nhappening in society, teachers being laid off, firemen being \nlaid off, restaurants going belly up, people are increasingly \nreluctant to give, given the impression that they have little \nhope that it will mean anything?\n    And lastly, how do you feel about a law that would limit \nyour giving simply to your Congressman, one Congressman, not \nyour State delegation, not anyone beyond the boundaries of your \nState? How do you feel personally, given your current political \nparticipation, about a law that would restrict your reach to \nyour own district or your State in terms of your political \nparticipation?\n    I would be happy to hear from any of you on one or more \nsubjects.\n    Ms. Baylin. I am very concerned about the last question, \nrestricting your contribution to an individual that was within \nyour district or State. It is just the fact that we are so \ndiverse as a country. Things that happen in California affect \nMaryland. Things that happen in the north of the country affect \nthe south of the country. I don't think we can limit ourselves \nany longer to that narrow field. I think we have to realize \nthat what happens in Congress, what happens in the United \nStates affects all of us. I think we have to be national in \nscope."
"fazio","Mr. Fazio","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Anyone else?\n    Mr. Kavanaugh. One of the things, the process where we look \nat candidates, the candidates are interviewed by the PAC and we \nkeep a real detailed voting record on how they vote on our \nissues, and at the PAC trustee Committee meetings each \ncandidate is discussed on his voting record, and the candidates \nare, if there is a political contribution that is considered \nfor them, people in their district certainly have the major \ninput on whether they are going to receive funding or not. It \nis not just at a national level. The level of the local person \nis really important on whether they should be considered for \nfunding. So I think that is important.\n    Ms. Dietz. And on the issue of the process, in my county \nthe political action interview team interviews all the \ncandidates and then "
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","makes a recommendation, and the positions of each of the candidates are \nprinted and disseminated throughout the membership, and then \nthere is an every member vote. It is a little different \ndepending on which level of race it concerns. But every member \nis given the information on all the candidates, and often that \nis the only time that they get information on all the \ncandidates in one publication."
"fazio","Mr. Fazio","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    You know your local candidates better, perhaps, \nbut do you feel you have had some say in the selection of State \nand Federal candidates through people who represent you?\n    Ms. Dietz. Well, I think it is natural for you to be more \ninformed the closer it is to home, and I feel that that is \ntrue, but I have also been able to enter into the debate on \nState candidates, and we send a representative to the Committee \nthat endorses or makes a recommendation on the congressional \nrace as well. Then that comes back to the county for \nendorsement or not. So that it is in the districts across \ndifferent counties."
"fazio","Mr. Fazio","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    So it is a shared responsibility?\n    Ms. Dietz. Yes. On the issue of how do you get people to \nbuy into that process, ask them. I find a lot of hope out \nthere. I don't think that people are hopeless and depressed \nabout the system. I ask them, would you like to donate to the \nPAC, and most say yes. Depending on how much homework we have \ndone and gotten a lot of information out on how the political \nprocess is affecting them, they are willing to donate. It is \nnot difficult to get people to buy in. You just have to tell \nthem how and ask them.\n    Mr. Kincaid. I think the fire fighters, we have seen over \ntime that collectively we are much stronger and our voice is \nmuch louder and we can get our issues heard. Our members see \nthat very clearly now.\n    We have a process also where we screen all our candidates \nlocally on the different levels, and everybody has an \nopportunity to participate in that, everybody that would like \nto. They are all screened on fire fighter issues. We steer \nclear of issues that are not fire fighter issues. It is kept to \nbe a very open process for us.\n    As far as supporting candidates outside of our own \ndistrict, fire fighter issues are nationwide, and our issues, \nas long as our issues are nationwide and as long as our issues \naffect fire fighters all over, we would always want the \nopportunity to assist anywhere where we can have somebody \nassist fire fighter issues."
"fazio","Mr. Fazio","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. A follow-on, have you ever been involved in \nan attempt to determine which candidate should receive a \ncontribution from your political action Committee? Have you \never been involved in the process and the candidate that you \nwanted to receive the money didn't? What was your reaction to \nthat?\n    Ms. Dietz. I was disappointed. But it happens. People are \nelected that I don't choose. I lose elections. I don't always \nget my way, but I feel if I have been able to come to the table \nand say my piece and had an opportunity to be included in the \nprocess, I am comfortable with that decision if I feel that it \nis broad based and based on the wishes of the association.\n    The Chairman. So you are comfortable if the decision is \nfrom the grass-roots up in a kind of triangular structure."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","fazio","Mr. Fazio","    What would your reaction be if you thought it was a \ndecision from the top notwithstanding the structure of the PAC; \nthat is, if a lot of people wanted them but the leadership \ndidn't, and it was always a decision of people at the top? \nWould you tend to participate in that kind of a structure? In \nother words, we want your money but not your opinion.\n    Ms. Dietz. That is not my experience. I probably wouldn't \nparticipate in that, but that is not my experience.\n    The Chairman. My assumption then is, that since you are all \ninvolved in participating, giving money and your time, that you \nbelieve that what you are involved in is a useful process.\n    Ms. Dietz. Definitely.\n    The Chairman. I want to thank you on behalf of the \nCommittee for giving up time out of your busy days to help us \ntrying to shape perhaps new rules and regulations for \ncandidates running for office.
