"smith","Senator Smith","","","    Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We \napologize for the delay in convening this hearing of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee. Too many duties early in the \nmorning before this one today.\n    I am pleased to have with me my colleague, Richard Lugar of \nIndiana, and our witnesses today. This morning we are here to \nexamine the situation in Kosovo. It is almost exactly a year to \nthe day since the war ended. We welcome on our first panel \nAmbassador James Pardew, Principal Deputy Special Advisor for \nKosovo and Dayton Implementation at the State Department.\n    We will then welcome Ambassador Morton Abramowitz, a member \nof the board of directors at the International Crisis Group, \nDr. Paul Williams, assistant professor of Law and International \nRelations at American University, and Janusz Bugajski, the \ndirector of East European Studies at the Center for Strategic \nand International Studies.\n    I appreciate the willingness of all our witnesses to share \nwith us their thoughts on what has occurred in Kosovo over the \ncourse of the past year, and I look forward to hearing their \nviews on how the United States should go about winning the \npeace.\n    With the withdrawal of the Yugoslav military forces from \nKosovo last June and the end of the NATO air strikes, the \nUnited Nations set up an interim administration and NATO \ndeployed tens of thousands of troops in the region for \npeacekeeping duties.\n    The goal of these missions was to establish a secure \nenvironment so that self-governing institutions could be formed \nand could function effectively. Certainly much has been \naccomplished since that time. Over 1 million ethnic Albanians \nwere able to return to their homes in Kosovo and begin the \nprocess of rebuilding their lives.\n    With the assistance of the international community, no one \nfroze or starved this past winter. Elections are being planned \nfor this fall, allowing the residents of Kosovo to choose their \npolitical leaders in a fair and open process. If serious \nproblems persist in Kosovo, it may make it impossible for the \nUnited Nations and NATO to accomplish its stated goals. Of \nthese, the most significant are the inherent contradictions \nbetween the statements of the international community, which \ncall for substantial autonomy and self-government in Kosovo \nwithin the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the wishes of \nnearly all ethnic Albanians for independence.\n    I wonder if the current policy of the alliance, that is, \nintentional ambiguity about the future status of Kosovo, \nwhether this is the most effective way to proceed. \nAdditionally, KFOR has been unable to prevent ethnic violence \nagainst Kosovar Serbs and other minorities, leading tens of \nthousands of them to flee Kosovo. Those that remain have \nboycotted interim structures established by the United Nations \ndesigned to bring Serbs and Albanians together for purposes of \ngoverning.\n    The tensions are especially high in the northern areas of \nKosovo, where most ethnic Serbs are living, and I fear that \nradical elements controlled by Belgrade will persist in \nundermining any chance of a peaceful resolution of those \ntensions. Incursions by ethnic Albanian militias into southern \nSerbia is also a serious cause for concern. Although they \nstated they will give up their effort to unify this area with \nKosovo, I fear that their ambitions have not been fully \nabandoned.\n    When the American soldiers intervene to prevent these \nincursions, there is a danger that they could be seen as the \nenemy by all sides. The slow pace at which the United Nations \nestablished its presence in Kosovo and its continued lethargic \nefforts at fully implementing its mandate has led to other \ndifficulties as well.\n    Judicial reform has barely begun, allowing various criminal \nelements free rein to operate. Indigenous administrative \nstructures are not operational. The international police is \nwoefully understaffed, and local police will not be able to \nfulfill these functions for quite sometime.\n    I supported the NATO air strikes in Kosovo and I support \ndoing what is necessary to win the peace as well. Difficult \ndecisions will have to be made regarding what kind of Kosovo we \nwant to see emerge. Postponing these decisions may be \ndetrimental to the long-term interests of the United States and \nour allies in the Balkans.\n    Again, I welcome our witnesses, and will turn to my \ncolleague for his opening statement."

break,break,break,break
"","","smith","Senator Smith","    Ambassador Pardew. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am very \npleased today to update the committee on the situation in \nKosovo 1 year after the NATO air campaign and intensive \ndiplomacy brought the conflict there to a halt. I will briefly \nsummarize my more formal testimony, which I would like to \nsubmit for the record."
"smith","Senator Smith","smith","Senator Smith","    Without objection.\n    Ambassador Pardew. My presentation will highlight the \naccomplishments to date in Kosovo, identify the challenges--\nmany of them mentioned in your statement--facing the \ninternational community, and outline the course of action for \nthe next several months as we see it.\n    Next Saturday is the 1-year anniversary of the adoption of \nSecretary General to establish an international security \npresence and interim civil administration in Kosovo. This \nresolution is the foundation for the international effort in \nKosovo, and will remain in effect until it is withdrawn by the \nunanimous vote of the Security Council. With the passage of \nUNSCR 1244, NATO forces already deployed in Macedonia and \nAlbania moved quickly into Kosovo as the nucleus of the \ninternational security force, or KFOR.\n    The international civil administration organization--the \nstanding capability except for a humanitarian effort. The \nconditions facing the international organization in June 1999 \nwere daunting. Thousands of Kosovars were killed or missing, \nmore than 1 million ethnic Albanians had been expelled from \ntheir home, Kosovo had no government, its economy was \ndevastated, an insurgent force, the Kosovo Liberation Army \nat the end of the conflict.\n    Kosovo was devoid of laws and judicial institutions. There \nwere no police, no judicial system, no prisons. Press \nfacilities and equipment had been destroyed. Community service \norganizations, schools and clinics were damaged, looted, and \ndestroyed.\n    Much has been accomplished in the past 365 days. We have \nstopped the killing by Serb security forces. We have returned 1 \nmillion refugees and displaced persons to their home areas, and \nwe got them through the winter. Services are available to some \ndegree in most areas. Schools are open. Basic health services \nare available, and the civil administration staff is being \npaid.\n    The international community has begun Kosovo's transition \nto a market economy with a hard currency monetary system, and a \nnew central bank. KFOR has overseen the demilitarization and \ndisarmament of the KLA and created a civilian-oriented Kosovo \nprosecutors, and trials are occurring in all districts.\n    The international community has deployed over 3,000 police \nof the 3,500 authorized, and more than half of the special \npolice have been deployed. Nearly 800 new recruits have \ngraduated from the OSCE police school, and we hope to have \n4,000 trained by early 2001.\n    Although recent violence has set back the Kosovar Serb \nparticipation in the interim administrative process, we are \nhopeful that the local Serbs will continue to participate in \nactivities that affect their future. Today, 193 in-country \nvoter registration sites are open, and almost 500,000 Kosovars \nhave registered for voter registration and personal \ndocumentation. We have 7 daily newspapers, 39 radio stations, \nand 5 broadcast outlets operational.\n    Mr. Chairman, as you mentioned, securing the peace and \npromoting democracy in Kosovo has been no easy task. Allow me \nto summarize some of the major challenges we face. I want to \nuse this forum this morning to highlight one current issue, the \nrecent vicious attacks on Serbs in Kosovo. We condemn these \nextremist attacks in the strongest possible terms.\n    Vigilante attacks against minority citizens violate the \nprinciples of democracy and tolerance which we hold so dear, \nand divert attention and limited resources away from assistance \nto law-abiding people of Kosovo. We are urging local Kosovar \nAlbanian leaders and the people to work with the UNMIK and KFOR \nto stop these attacks.\n    Other challenges include the U.N. staffing procedure. The \nUnited Nations must improve its capability to deploy and \norganize staff for civil administrative structures. With over \n60 percent of its authorized strength, municipalities are not \nadequately governed, and key managerial positions have gone \nunfilled.\n    In mid-May, the U.S. Government began an initiative with \nthe United Nations and the European Union to resolve these \nstaffing shortfalls. The United Nations in New York is \ndelegating hiring authority to the field and assigning \npersonnel specialists to UNMIK to speed up the hiring process. \nThe criminal justice system in Kosovo remains inadequate. This \nspring, the United States conducted a comprehensive judicial \nassessment and organized a quick start program for local \ncourts.\n    OSCE is strengthening judicial training, and as an interim \nmeasure the Special Representative to the Secretary General \nplans to place international judges in Kosovo district courts \nto handle sensitive cases.\n    Mitrovica and southern Serbia continue to be potential \nflashpoints. KFOR and UNMIK have developed a set of measures to \naddress the issue in Mitrovica. The United Nations has \nappointed a strong regional administrator in Bill Nash, an \nAmerican. KFOR has established control zones of confidence, and \ninternational judges and prosecutors have been appointed there \nto deal with the criminal issues.\n    UNMIK is engaging an international consortium in the mining \nprogram in the area to begin preliminary work on the mines. \nAnother challenge is demobilized members of the KLA, including \nthose who have joined the Kosovo Protection Corps. Some of them \nhave acted inappropriately. KFOR retains high standards for \nparticipation in the KPC organization, and we support a zero \ntolerance policy regarding illicit activities by members of the \nKPC. So far, KFOR has initiated 95 individual investigations, \nexpelled four and suspended nine members of the KPC for \nmisbehavior.\n    Finally, the continued retention of power by the Milosevic \nregime in Belgrade obstructs progress in Kosovo, as it does \nelsewhere in the region. The sooner the Milosevic regime is \nreplaced by a democratic alternative, the sooner the region can \nbegin to heal.\n    The recent crackdown on independent media and students \nshows that the regime is fearful, brittle, and in a downward \nspiral. We continue to oppose those individuals and actions \nthat reinforce Milosevic, and we support those who promote \ndemocratic alternatives. Our focus for the next several months \nwill be on establishing democracy in Kosovo, but defining the \nterm in the UNSCR 1244 substantial autonomy in the interim \nperiod.\n    The first step is to overcome the practical challenges that \nI have discussed previously. The second step is to establish \nthe provisional institutions for democratic self-government \nunder the international supervision of UNMIK, including \nmunicipal elections to be held in October.\n    The issue of final status of Kosovo was set aside for now \nas we promote democracy, autonomy, and economic development. We \nhave been clear and consistent that Europe must shoulder the \nlion's share of the resource burden in Kosovo. Our European \nallies accept this responsibility. Under normal conditions, the \nU.S. fields about 5,500 of the 45,000 troops in Kosovo plus 800 \nsupport troops in Macedonia, thus our contribution to KFOR \nremains at about 14 percent of the total KFOR deployment.\n    In other areas in the general category of revitalization \nand reconstruction for Kosovo, the total contribution for \ncalendar year 2000 for all donors is about $1.1 billion. At \n$168 million, the U.S. contribution for 2000 for Kosovo's \nrevitalization and reconstruction is about 14.6 percent.\n    We understand and agree with the Senate's concerns about \nadequate burden-sharing in Kosovo, and we are vigilant in \nensuring that our European allies honor their commitments. At \nthe same time, the United States needs to fulfill its \nobligation as a party in Europe.\n    Mr. Chairman, for months now several ideas have been \nproposed in the Congress that limits U.S. participation in \nKosovo, or links our participation to levels of resource \nsupport provided by Europe. The message from the Congress on \nburden-sharing has been received loud and clear on both sides \nof the Atlantic.\n    We continue to believe that legislation which limits the \nflexibility of this administration and the next one is \nunnecessary and unwise. Arbitrary percentages on ceilings on \nour participation risk reciprocal actions in the future, limits \nour policy actions, and degrades our leadership in the key \nsecurity institutions.\n    The engagement of the United States in Europe and our \nallies in Kosovo has been a success, but much work remains. We \nstopped the killing, restored regional stability, and are \nbeginning to reinvigorate society and bring democracy to \nKosovo. Our continuing engagement in Kosovo relates directly to \nour national security interest.\n    Two days ago, we had another anniversary, the anniversary \nof the D-day landing, and that anniversary reminds us of our \nsecurity linkage to Europe. Our security is served by our \nleadership and participation in European security institutions \nlike NATO and the OSCE. We cannot expect these institutions to \nsupport our interest if we do not participate in important \nEuropean security issues.\n    Second, we know from history that a stable Europe is vital \nto American security, and that Europe is not stable if its \nsoutheastern corner is in turmoil. In the past 5 years, the \nUnited States and our allies have successfully contained and \nthen subdued conflicts in Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo as the \nformer Yugoslavia broke apart, but the area's stability remains \nat risk from the Milosevic regime and the fragile states \nrecovering from the conflict.\n    The international security and civil administration \npresence is critical not only to creating a secure environment \nin Kosovo, but for sustaining the peace and establishing the \nconditions for long-term stability in the region. The costs of \nour engagement have not been excessive, Mr. Chairman, and we \nmust remain engaged with our allies.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this opportunity to update the \ncommittee."

"","","jr.","Hon. James W. Pardew, Jr.","    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to be here today to update the committee \non the situation in Kosovo one year after the NATO air campaign \nexpelled Milosevic's security forces from the area. Today, I wish to \nreview the current situation in Kosovo, highlight the accomplishments \nto date, and identify the greatest challenges we face. I will conclude \nwith some points on the key objectives in Kosovo over the next several \nmonths.\n    First, let me go back slightly more than one year to pay tribute to \nthe men and women of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission (KDOM) and \nOSCE's Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM). These unarmed international \npeacekeepers and diplomats, including a significant number of U.S. \nForeign Service personnel, risked their lives daily on the ground in \nKosovo seeking to avoid war in the autumn and winter of 1998. On March \n20, 1999, these peacekeepers were forced to withdraw, as the Milosevic \nethnic cleansing program against the Albanian majority in Kosovo became \nincreasingly brutal and made peacekeeping ineffective. Three days after \nthey withdrew, NATO began the air campaign against the FRY that, in \ncombination with an intensive diplomatic effort on many fronts, \nexpelled Milosevic's security forces from Kosovo."

"","","jr.","Hon. James W. Pardew, Jr.","    Almost exactly one year ago, a rapid series of events established \nthe conditions for the international security force and the interim \ncivil administration organization operating in Kosovo today. On June 3 \nof last year, Belgrade accepted the G-8 conditions to pull its security \nforces from Kosovo and agreed to negotiate with NATO a Military \nTechnical Agreement (MTA) spelling out the conditions for that \nwithdrawal. On June 10, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution \n1244, authorizing the Secretary General to establish an international \nsecurity presence and an interim civilian administration to restore \norder and governance to Kosovo. NATO suspended the air campaign the \nnext day once the MTA was signed and the withdrawal of Serbian security \nforces had begun in earnest.\n    Already deployed on the perimeter of the conflict to assist the \nhumanitarian relief efforts in Macedonia and Albania, NATO forces moved \nquickly into Kosovo on June 12 as the nucleus of the international \nKosovo Force (KFOR). The international civil administration \norganization, the U.N.

break,break,break,break
"","","jr.","Hon. James W. Pardew, Jr.","    As expected, securing the peace and promoting democracy in Kosovo \nis no easy task. Allow me to summarize some of the most significant \nchallenges we face today.\n    The U.N. must improve its capability to deploy and organize staff \nfor its civil administrative structures. While UNMIK has begun to \naddress the problems caused by Belgrade's actions, it has not fully \nestablished its authority over civil administration. With only 60% of \nits authorized civil administration staff deployed, it has not been \nable to adequately govern many municipalities. Additionally, some key \nmanagerial positions have gone unfilled. The United Nations' system of \npersonnel recruitment and appointment has slowed significantly the \ncivilian implementation process in Kosovo.\n    The Department of State is making a concerted effort to focus \ninternational attention on UNMIK's staffing problems. In mid-May, a \nU.S. government team began coordinating with the U.N. and EU on a plan \nto remedy civil administration staffing shortfalls. The EU is also \nsupporting an initiative with the aim of soliciting qualified personnel \nfrom its member nations for vacant positions in the EU pillar. In \naddition, the U.N. in New York is delegating hiring authority to the \nfield and assigning personnel specialists to UNMIK to speed the hiring \nprocess. These measures are a welcome beginning to much-needed reform.\n    The criminal justice system in Kosovo remains inadequate. Courtroom \nfacilities must be improved and the trial monitoring structure should \nbe strengthened. In some instances, local judges have been unable to \neffectively try cases and the number of supplemental international \njudges is not enough to compensate. More civilian prison space is \nrequired. This spring the United States conducted a comprehensive \njudicial assessment and organized a ``quick start'' program to deliver \nmuch needed electrical generators and office equipment as early as this \nmonth to local courts. We are also working with the OSCE to strengthen \nits judicial training capacity. As an interim measure, until local \njudges are sufficiently trained in democratic law and secure enough to \nconsider adjudicating a full docket, the SRSG plans to place \ninternational judges in all Kosovo district courts to handle sensitive \ncases.\n    Another weak spot in the criminal justice system is the lack of \nsufficient detention facilities and experienced personnel to run them. \nUNMIK has trained about 260 corrections officers, and an additional 60 \nare currently in training. More needs to be done to fulfill the \nrequirement for 600 officers to operate the prison system. A prison in \nIstok that can hold 520 inmates re-opened on June 1 and will expand \nsignificantly the system's current incarceration capacity. We are \nworking with our allies to shore up the system in the interim, and \nprovide the resources necessary to create and sustain a functioning \npenal system.\n    The municipal elections, which will be held this fall, will further \nfocus the involvement of local leaders in municipal administrative \nstructures by providing a public mandate to guide their participation. \nOrganization for the elections is well underway.\n    The Serbs who remain in Kosovo feel insecure and are reluctant \npartners in steps to establish democracy in Kosovo. The OSCE and UNMIK \nare engaging with the Serb community to stress the importance of civil \nregistration, but thus far few Serbs are registering. We are also \nworking on a pilot project to return Serbs to Kosovo, and are \ninvestigating possibilities for enhanced assistance to existing Serb \ncommunities.\n    Mitrovica and southern Serbia continue to be potential flashpoints. \nEthnic Albanian insurgents in the Presevo region had pledged to reject \nthe use of violence and seek a political solution, but we know that \ntheir insurgency continues. We continue to warn extremists on both \nsides of the border that provocation and violence will not be \ntolerated. Additionally, KFOR and UNMIK are monitoring the situation \ncarefully.\n    KFOR and UNMIK have developed a set of measures to address the \nissue of Mitrovica. The U.N. has appointed a strong administrator for \nthe region, American retired General William Nash. KFOR and UNMIK have \nreturned more than 140 displaced Albanians to homes north of the Ibar \nRiver and KFOR-controlled ``Zones of Confidence'' have been established \nin problem areas around two bridges and one neighborhood. Two \ninternational judges and an international prosecutor have been \nappointed in Mitrovica. Additionally, UNMIK is engaging an \ninternational mining consortium to begin preliminary work in elements \nof the Trepce mining complex, previously the largest economic \nenterprise in Kosovo.\n    The violence toward minorities and the atmosphere of intolerance in \nKosovo is of serious concern. The overall reduction in violence over \nthe past year is heartening and is a tribute to KFOR and UNMIK police \nefforts. However, recent violence against Serbs and Roma, the isolation \nof those communities and the appearance of provocative ``vigilante \njournalism'' undermines the international effort in Kosovo and sets \nback the process of creating a tolerant democratic society there. We \nbelieve that those who aspire to lead in Kosovo should denounce these \ndevelopments as UNMIK and KFOR take measures to improve security for \nminorities.\n    We are keenly aware of the possibility that demobilized members of \nthe former KLA, including those who have joined the KPC, may act \ninappropriately. KFOR retains high standards for participation in the \norganization and enforces a zero tolerance policy regarding illicit \nactivities by members of the KPC. In March, KFOR and UNMIK put into \nforce the KPC Disciplinary Code (DC), which constitutes the formal \nmechanism for enforcement of the rules for compliance and disciplinary \naction against offenders. The DC applies to all KPC members and \nprovides the legal basis for the commander of the KPC to take \ndisciplinary action against non-compliant members. UNMIK and KFOF also \nrecently signed the Compliance Enforcement Framework Document, which \nassigns responsibility for investigating criminal actions to UNMIK, \nadministrative discipline to KPC, and compliance violations to KFOR. \nThus far, KFOR has initiated 95 individual investigations, expelled 4, \nand suspended 9 KPC members.\n    One regional challenge is critical to Kosovo. The continued \nretention of power by the Milosevic regime in Belgrade obstructs \nprogress in Kosovo as it does elsewhere in the region. The Milosevic \nfactor confuses engagement with Kosovar Serbs and prevents any serious \ndiscussion of long-term options with the Kosovar Albanians. The sooner \nthe Milosevic regime is replaced by democratic alternatives, the sooner \nthe region can begin to heal. The recent crackdown on independent media \nand students shows that the regime is fearful, brittle, and in a \ndownward spiral. While no one can predict when a change in Belgrade \nwill occur, we continue to oppose those individuals and actions which \nreinforce Milosevic, and we support those which promote democratic \nalternatives."

"","","jr.","Hon. James W. Pardew, Jr.","    We have been clear and consistent that Europe must shoulder the \nlion's share of the resource burden in Kosovo. Our NATO Allies, \npartners and other countries do contribute the large majority of KFOR's \nforces. Under normal conditions, the U.S. fields about 5,500 of the \n45,000 troops in Kosovo, plus 800 support troops in Macedonia. Thus, \nthe U.S. contribution stays close to 14% of the total KFOR deployment. \nIn the general category of revitalization and reconstruction for \nKosovo, the total contribution for CY2000 from all donors is about $1.1 \nbillion. At $168 million, the U.S. contribution for 2000 for Kosovo's \nrevitalization and reconstruction is about 14.6%. We understand and \nagree with the Senate's concerns about adequate burdensharing in \nKosovo, and are vigilant in ensuring that our European allies honor \ntheir commitments.

"smith","Senator Smith","jr.","Hon. James W. Pardew, Jr.","    Mr. Ambassador, from the beginning of our \ninvolvement in Kosovo I have supported the administration both \nin the decision to engage and in defending it recently on a \nmove in the Senate to withdraw.\n    But I have also said from the beginning that I do not \nbelieve our objective is realistic. The objective of the \ninternational community is autonomy within Yugoslavia for \nKosovo. The problem I have is that nobody on the ground seems \nto want that. The Serbs want Kosovo on their terms, and the \nAlbanians want independence of the Serbs. Can you allay my \nongoing skepticism of the achievability of our stated goal?\n    Ambassador Pardew. Mr. Chairman, the difficulty in \ndiscussing long-term status of Kosovo is compounded by the \nMilosevic problem in Belgrade. It is impossible to have a \nmeaningful discussion with Kosovars over the long-term status \nwith Milosevic in power in Belgrade, and so close to the tragic \nevents that have occurred in Kosovo."
"smith","Senator Smith","smith","Senator Smith","    Does it substantially abate if Milosevic is \ngone? Do you think the Albanians will want to be----\n    Ambassador Pardew. Not immediately, I do not, but we \ncontinue to believe that some appropriate relationship with \nSerbia yet to be defined is better than independence.\n    We have not supported independence, but we do insist that \nthe final status of Kosovo must be acceptable to the people of \nKosovo. Right now, we have set that issue aside while we work \nto achieve democratic institutions, a market economy, and to \nbring Western democratic values to the area. It is just \nimpossible at this point in time, sir, to have a serious \ndiscussion with them on the status question."
"smith","Senator Smith","smith","Senator Smith","    But the consequence of sticking to this \nhybrid end game is, we are there for an indeterminate amount of \ntime, nation-building on our terms and not their terms. Am I \nwrong in that fear?\n    Ambassador Pardew. We certainly cannot put a timeframe on \nour presence there. Again, we believe that the area is \nimportant, regional stability is important, and we have to take \nthe necessary measures to ensure regional stability. However, \nwe learned from Bosnia not to set specific time lines on when \nwe can leave.\n    I can only say our focus right now is on defining what \nsubstantial autonomy means in this interim period. We are doing \neverything we can to give them effective governance under the \nUNMIK structure for this interim period and set aside the long-\nterm status."
"smith","Senator Smith","smith","Senator Smith","    What I think you have implied, in order for \nthat ever to be achievable we have got to get rid of Mr. \nMilosevic. What is being done on that score?\n    Ambassador Pardew. We are working with our allies in Europe \nin a range of measures to undermine the Milosevic regime and to \npromote those forces that support democracy. We are pursuing a \nnumber of initiatives. We are supporting independent media in \nthe FRY. We are working with the Serb opposition. We are \npromoting the democracy in Bosnia and in Montenegro and in \nKosovo and in the surrounding area. We have a very serious \nsanctions regime which we are tightening with our European \nallies right now.\n    So there are a whole range of very serious measures we are \nusing, but ultimately, Mr. Chairman, whether Milosevic goes or \nstays is an issue for Serbs. The Serbian people have to decide \nwhen he goes. We hope that that will happen sooner rather than \nlater."

What role are they taking on \nthe ground?\n    Ambassador Pardew. This whole Serbian issue and the breakup \nof Yugoslavia has been a very difficult problem for the \nRussians. They have their own domestic political factors to \nconsider, and quite frankly, their actions have sometimes been \ninconsistent. For example, Foreign Minister Ivanov apologized \npublicly for the visit to Moscow by the person under indictment \nby the War Crimes Tribunal.\n    In other cases the Russians have been extremely helpful. \nThey were helpful in the negotiation of the end of the air \ncampaign. We are working with them expectively in the contact \ngroup, so the relationship with Russia over Kosovo has varied \nfrom time to time.\n    Their forces, if I could go on, have been responsible \nmembers of the alliance in Kosovo and have, in fact, acted \nprofessionally. So in many ways Russia has been a plus, but \nthere have been those instances in which they have made things \na little more difficult for us, and they have made mistakes \nwhich they have openly admitted."
"smith","Senator Smith","smith","Senator Smith","    Senator Lugar."
"lugar","Senator Lugar","smith","Senator Smith","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ambassador Pardew, \nyou have described, I think accurately and very thoughtfully, \nthe status of our forces in Kosovo, and the job they have to \ndo, and that is a very difficult one. Chairman Smith has \nsurveyed the larger picture and your role as advisor to the \nPresident and Secretary for democracy in the Balkans. You have \ntaken a larger view even as you try to help bring democracy to \n2 million people in Kosovo.\n    I would just underline the thought that the debate that we \nhad the other day on the Byrd-Warner amendment was especially \nimportant because it drew the Senate's attention for the first \ntime to the responsibilities of the United States in Europe. We \nall understand that role in a way, and Chairman Smith's \nunderlining of the D-day anniversary is significant. You have \ntalked about this as well.\n    We are in Europe because we want to be there and because \nEuropeans want us to be there. The German Foreign Minister and \nthe French Foreign Minister have come through here, have met \nwith us and have emphasized that our presence in Europe has \nmade all the difference in terms of peace in Europe for the \npast 60-years--all because the United States is there, and we \nare there in a very large way as a leader of NATO.\n    Now, the thing that was upsetting about the debate the \nother day was that, because of the irritation of many Members \nof the Senate who reflect the public as a whole, we might cut \nand run under very dubious circumstances. They feel this way \nout of irritation or weariness, over a lack of foresight in \nKosovo, a lack of comprehensive plans now, or the lack of an \nend game plan.\n    For each of us who have been involved in these discussions, \nwhether it be the White House or the State Department, there \nwas not a consensus in the Senate or the House as to what had \noccurred. The votes were always very problematic, and on \noccasion, as you recall, even after we had been involved in \nbombing for several weeks, there was a tie vote in the House on \nwhether we should be bombing at all.\n    So, in a way democracy works, and we finally confronted in \nthis very close vote the fact that we have a responsibility, \nand it is a very tough one, but it is an ongoing \nresponsibility.\n    This was a close call, and the administration understands \nthat, and, in fairness, Secretary Cohen and Secretary Albright \nand perhaps yourself and others were very busy, as you needed \nto be, to explain how drastic circumstances might be.\n    Now, having said that, I am concerned that there does not \nappear to be in our administration, quite apart from NATO or \nthe United Nations, an overall strategy. There are pieces of \nthis, and sometimes persons like yourself are able to be an \ninterlocutor and relate them.\n    For instance, the Southeast European Assistance Plan is \nextremely important. It is important for those in that area, \nfor the United States, for NATO, Bulgaria, Romania and other \ncountries because the problems in Serbia have isolated them in \nterms of trade and development even as they wish to become a \npart of NATO and wish to become affiliated with us. There has \nbeen almost no debate here and very little word about our \nparticipation, although it is a European situation primarily.\n    Likewise how are Albania and Macedonia to be supported \ngiven Serbia in the middle of all this, quite apart from the \nKosovo situation or from Montenegro? From time to time we edge \nup to what we should be doing in Montenegro.\n    Not all of it is covert, but it sometimes takes on that \nflavor. After all, Kosovo is a part of Serbia and, therefore, \nit is unseemly to get into too much discussion about the whole \nplace which might be stabilized this summer, and we may have a \nbig NATO problem again for which we're not very well prepared.\n    And I don't see, as the chairman has pointed out, an end \ngame at all with regard to Kosovo. Now, you have to answer \nthese questions diplomatically because our European friends are \nvery sensitive on the issue of independence and autonomy, and \ntherefore public testimony by you or anybody else is likely to \nbe difficult.\n    But the fact is that, as I rephrase the steps of how we got \ninvolved to begin with, we were involved at Rambouillet.\n    We felt a responsibility to make that conference credible. \nWhoever made the estimate that the bombing raids would change \nthe opinion of Milosevic may or may not have been correct. \nWhether we were prepared for that war is beside the point, \nbecause it is over, but the fact is there are lots of questions \nabout Rambouillet, our negotiating position, and how we came \ninto such a war to begin with, and all the ramifications that \nfollow it.\n    Now, I think at some point either your administration or \nthe next one has to put in context what is going to happen, and \nwe have to take leadership in the United States and in NATO to \nmake it happen.\n    As it stands, it seems to me we are mostly reactive and \ndefensive. Some say that 15 percent of the people there doing \npeacekeeping seems like a fair share, but we are skeptical \nwhether the Europeans are doing their share. It is a very small \narea anyway and very tough for any of these people to make a \ndifference in southeastern Europe, its economy, and lack of \noverall strategy.\n    What can you inform us about any overall strategic plan, or \na way in which the administration might explain or take \nleadership in bringing some plan so that you then come to the \nCongress and say this is the way it is. It may be expensive, \nbut these are things we have got to do, and they involve all \nthese countries, and they involve money and investment and the \nrest.\n    This is preferable to a piecemeal approach to Kosovo \nappearing, in ways suggesting that we might do something more \nor we might not, or defending the amount that we are doing. I \nthink ultimately you would have to admit this is an interim \nstop-gap affair or a finger in the dike, and hope that some \ngood things might happen, like Milosevic leaving, or other \ncountries stepping to the fore.\n    Can you give us any grand idea about all of this?\n    Ambassador Pardew. I do not know how grand it will be \nSenator, but I will give it my best shot.\n    First of all, I think we appear sometimes to be reactive, \nbecause we are in some ways responding to events we do not \ncontrol. I mean, we simply cannot predict what Milosevic is \ngoing to do tactically. This all started in the early nineties \nas Yugoslavia came apart, and we were faced with confrontations \nbetween these new countries. Bosnia was a particular difficult \nexample.\n    We tried long ago to deter Milosevic from taking action in \nKosovo but we were not successful, and we do not know for sure \nwhat he might do next. But you are exactly right in that it is \nvery difficult to deal with regional issues because of Serbia's \ncurrent leadership, its location and the size of its \npopulation.\n    I would say that our strategy is governed by our interest \nin regional stability. We wish to take a regional approach to \nproblems, not just a piece by piece approach.\n    Part of the regional strategy is the Stability Pact and \nwhat we are trying to do to integrate countries of the region \ninto the European economic system and the European political \ninstitutions. We seek to bring these countries into NATO, OSCE, \nEU, and other regional institutions, and to have them work \ntogether toward common economic structures and goals. The \nStability Pact is a large part of that effort.\n    Another element of our strategy is the replacement of the \nregime in Serbia, because such a change is so critical to the \nregion, and our goal of building democracies in these \ncountries. We have made great headway in Croatia. We have not \nhad as much success in Bosnia as we would have liked, but \nthings have gotten better there. We are working very hard in \nKosovo to improve the situation. Overall, I would characterize \nour strategy as based on regional stability and regional \ncooperation. Then you go into the individual countries and what \nwe are doing there."

"","","smith","Senator Smith","  STATEMENT OF HON."
break,break,break,break
"","","smith","Senator Smith","    Ambassador Abramowitz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I very much \nappreciate the chance to discuss Kosovo with you. Let me just \nsay that there have been very powerful voices on this committee \nover the past decade saying some very important things, and it \nis an honor for me to be with some of them here today. Thank \nyou very much.\n    Kosovo is a subject of great political and moral \nimportance. For all the ills of Western policy in the Balkans \nthe past year, the useless rhetoric--past decade, I should \nsay--the useless rhetoric, the evasions of reality, the half-\nway measures, in the end Kosovo represented an extraordinary \nallied motivation effort and accomplishment.\n    Kosovo, of course, is not over. It remains a poor, \ndisorganized society with a long-term security problem. It is \nessential for the people of Kosovo, peace in the Balkans, and \nto the cohesion and the values of the alliance that our efforts \nto create a stable and reasonable democratic Kosovo be \nsuccessful. That will require continuing personnel, military \nand civilian resources of sizable magnitude, determination, and \nsome political imagination.\n    There is no easy exit strategy, that wonderful phrase which \nis often used to lead democratic countries to less decisive \naction or no action at all, and ultimately produces greater \ncost and greater suffering. How long Western forces have to \nstay, and the magnitude of the resources needed, will be \nheavily dependant by what we and our allies do in Kosovo in a \nwider regional setting.\n    I thought it might be useful to raise at least five \nimportant questions about our efforts in Kosovo, and I will try \nto be brief. The first and most obvious is where are we, and \nwhat has been accomplished?\n    Mr. Chairman, you have already answered that very well. \nYour description at the beginning of the session I think was \ndead on, and I am not going to repeat essentially what you had \nsaid. I would like to just close that part with a little \nparagraph which I have written which says, it seems inevitable \nthat after a war the resources and attention of concerned \nnations to post-war reconstruction fall far behind what is \nneeded, indeed, in some cases imperiling the results of the \nwar.\n    The U.N. administration has been burdened with a deficiency \nof all sorts of resources, as well as a mandate to keep Kosovo \nas part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which flies in \nthe face of reality. However valiant their effort, it is clear \nthat UNMIK has neither the resources, time, nor ability to \nreshape Kosovo society, but UNMIK, with the help of KFOR, can \nestablish a reasonably secure political environment, encourage \nresponsible political parties, promote movement or democratic \npractices, and institute an elective process.\n    My second question is, do Serbs still have a place in \nKosovo? In Kosovo our ideals collide with popular fears and \nprofound antagonisms. It is not a situation that can be changed \novernight. Serbs have been leaving Kosovo for the past 20 \nyears, as Albanian predominance in the province increased. The \noutcome of the war sped further departures. Probably half of \npre-war Kosovo's 200,000 Serbs, not all of whom were long-term \nresidents, fled partially because of Albanian violence or \nprovocation, but in part because they also feared to live under \nAlbanian rule, or lost their jobs when Serbian administration \nceased.\n    Despite their inhospitable reception in Serbia, and the \npresence of KFOR in Kosovo, it is uncertain whether many Kosovo \nSerbs want to return to Kosovo without jobs to go to, which \nhave largely been taken over by Albanians, and without the \nrestoration of Serbian authority. The latter is not likely for \na long time to come, if ever. To encourage Serbs remaining in \nKosovo to stay and those in Serbia to return is no easy task, \nand from the perspective of many Albanians in Kosovo the fewer \nSerbs in Kosovo the better, and the less likely in the future \nthat Serbia would attempt to take back the area.\n    The issue of Serb returns is a tricky one, in part because \nBelgrade is deeply involved in the Serb presence in Kosovo. \nMany Serbs also came late to Kosovo, as part of Belgrade's \napparatus. In part, this issue of returns is also intimately \nrelated to the establishment of a serious Kosovo entity, one \nwith a real court system, a better rule of law, and adequate \npolicing, in short, a functioning society where there is \nsecurity and predictability.\n    That does not yet exist in Kosovo, and encouraging Serbs to \nreturn at this point is questionable, since they will almost \ncertainly end up in enclaves controlled by Belgrade, but while \na stable environment is necessary, it is probably not \nsufficient. Getting Serbs to return will also require \ncontinuing Western pressure, lots of material support and \nmilitary and police protection for some uncertain time to come.\n    This means: No. 1, that Serbs must somehow be assured \nsecurity, democratic rights, power-sharing in their \ncommunities, and political participation outside their \ncommunities, however difficult that will be in Albanian areas.\n    No. 2, that Serbs in Kosovo will have to accept that they \nwill have to live in a single Kosovo not ruled by Belgrade. \nRight now, that does not seem to be the case for a large number \nof them.\n    No. 3, that Albanian violence must be controlled, and \nAlbanian leaders need to understand that they will ultimately \nhave to accept the return of those Serbs wishing to return to \nKosovo and make that work as well as possible if they are to \nsustain the international community support for majority rule \nin Kosovo.\n    Given the difficulties and uncertainties involved, one \npractical strategy does not answer the problem, but one \npractical strategy might be to focus initial returns on the \nmuch smaller number of displaced Roma gypsies, who invariably \nget the short end of the stick. If their returns can be \nsuccessfully managed, it could offer some confidence to move \nahead with a program to return Serbs to Kosovo.\n    My third question, one that you have alluded to and Senator \nLugar has alluded to, is the uncertainty of the future status \nof Kosovo inhibiting the political and economic development of \nKosovo. The answer to this is almost certainly yes, although it \nis hard to quantify.\n    Economic and political decisions are made because the only \ninternational mandate is U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244, \nwhich says that Kosovo's part of the Federal Republic of \ncontribute to delay in creating meaningful institutions which \nare run by the people of Kosovo. There seems to be a continuing \nstruggle between UNMIK and Pristina and the United Nations in \nNew York over the implementation of a mandate and the structure \nand timing of self rule.\n    Russia and China are against any change in the \ninternational status of Kosovo. The allies continue to fear \nthat a too rapid movement toward Kosovo self-rule and any \nenunciation of Kosovo independence as a goal will imperil the \nviability of Macedonia and stir up a major international \ndispute.\n    They all apparently believe that the issue of Kosovo's \nstatus could be better dealt with once Milosevic leaves the \nscene. That is, there is a greater possibility of keeping \nKosovo and Serbia together in some way if Serbia has a more \ndemocratic government, or conversely, that a more democratic \ngovernment in Serbia is more likely to accept the succession of \nKosovo, or at least a republic status for Kosovo in the FRY.\n    One problem with this approach is that no one is smart \nenough to figure out when Milosevic will lose power. However \nsignificant the weaknesses of his regime, his departure could \nbe delayed a long time. We have seen that with Castro, we have \nseen that with Saddam Hussein. It could be delayed a long time, \ncreating tension and instability in Kosovo should power and \nresponsibility continue to be denied the Albanians.\n    Moreover, it is not at all clear that a post-Milosevic \nGovernment will have the desire or the political backing to \naccept a change in Kosovo's status. One could reasonably argue \nthat it is better for the international community and the Serb \nopposition to change Kosovo's status while Milosevic is in \ncharge.\n    Another problem is our use of so-called Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia, the FRY. I think we all know why the term was used \nin 1244 and not Serbia. The sad fact is, the FRY is the family \nenterprise of Mr. Milosevic that serves to give his rule some \nlegal patina. Every republic has gotten out, and the last \nremaining one, Montenegro, also wants out, much to our \ndiscomfiture.\n    Resurrection of the FRY is a highly dubious enterprise even \nin a post-Milosevic period. It is, however, at this time not \npossible politically in the international community, whether it \nis desirable or not, easier now rather than later, to change \nthe status of court in Kosovo by the international community, \nand that, I believe, is producing a drift in Kosovo and in \nallied determination.\n    The people in Kosovo still do not know what local elections \nwhich are to be held in the autumn mean, and there seems to be, \nat least among some allies, a sense that Kosovo is really part \nof Serbia. It is important for the United States to make its \nviews crystal clear to the people of Kosovo and to the world at \nlarge that while the status of Kosovo still has to be \ndetermined, Serbian rule will not return to Kosovo and \nindependence is a possible goal once certain conditions about \nthe nature of independent Kosovo are met, including a \ndemonstrated commitment to minority rights, and an adherence to \ninternationally recognized borders.\n    Credible elections will also be needed to establish the \nlegitimacy of Kosovo Governments, and the growing \nresponsibility of those voted into office. In short, we either \nstart to set the rules for a transition to what may be Kosovo \nindependence, or we allow ourselves to be hostage to events in \nKosovo and the region.\n    My fourth question: How do Serbia and Kosovo live with each \nother in the long run? If Western forces are to ever be \nwithdrawn from Kosovo, clearly Serbia and Kosovo must be able \nto work out some sort of stable relationship. Whether this will \nbe possible, and when, I am not smart enough to predict.\n    The history of the two communities has obviously been a \nviolent one, but even if that objective is difficult to attain, \nit is important not to lose sight of it. I think we can say at \nleast a few things about the longer term. First, the \nrelationship cannot improve while Milosevic remains in power. \nHe is still trying to preserve the potentiality for Serb rule \nin Kosovo, and to undermine UNMIK authority. We cannot do \nbusiness with him, and a different type of Serbia will be \nneeded.\n    Second, even if a Serbian Abe Lincoln took charge and \noffered malice toward none, not one Albanian would support any \nserious political tie to Belgrade. Nevertheless, the Albanian \nleaders of Kosovo must realize that, while independence is \ntheir goal, they will have to coexist with next door ultimately \na much stronger Serbia. They must examine the government that \nsucceeds Milosevic in that light, and how they might proceed \nconstructively with its leaders. They must also recognize that \na continuing Western military presence in Kosovo could be \nchallenged by the domestic considerations and domestic politics \nin allied nations.\n    Third, and this is, I think, in the end ultimately the most \nimportant thing, much will depend on Europe and what it does in \nKosovo, in Serbia when it is free of Milosevic, and in the \nbroad Balkan region. The prospects for stability and ultimate \nreconciliation in the Balkans depend in great part both on \neconomic growth in all the countries, but also on their \nrespective relationships with Europe.\n    It will be only possible to remove Western troops when both \nKosovo and Serbia are bound to European institutions in some \nserious fashion. Whether Europe can rise to the occasion and \nproduce a long term integrative process remains to be seen. \nEurope has plenty of things on its mind. But I believe that the \nEU increasingly recognizes that connection, and Mr. Solana and \nMr. Patten have added enormous energy and urgency to the EU \neffort.\n    Finally, what is the role of the United States in shaping \nthe future of Kosovo? The United States was the heart of the \nalliance war effort, but long term, however, it is the EU, as I \nnoted above, which has a central role in ultimately stabilizing \nthe former Yugoslavia, but it can take a long while to get to \nthe long term, and the United States remains essential for \nsecurity and for political purposes.\n    The United States supplies only 15 percent of KFOR, but the \ncontinued presence of a significant American force is needed to \nprovide the assurance to the Kosovo Albanians that Serb forces \nwill not simply be able one day to walk in and resume control. \nThe presence of American forces conveys a similar type message \nto any Serbian Government. Certainly, until more progress is \nmade in creating new, self-sustaining political institutions in \nKosovo, and we see the impact of a post-Milosevic Government in \nBelgrade, serious American forces will be required.\n    While the bulk of the military presence will have to come \nfrom European countries, I think it would be a mistake to \nsimply consider the division of forces a burden-sharing \nproblem. The nature and role of American forces are also \nimportant, whether U.S. military efforts are narrowly confined \nor significantly robust, and determined to get the job done.\n    I note that Kosovo Serbs have complained a few days ago \nthat British forces do a better job of providing protection to \nSerbs than American ones. That may be unfair. I do not know. \nBut I think the way our forces are being used in Kosovo is \nworth serious review.\n    There is, moreover, an important political purpose served \nby the continuing presence of U.S. forces in Kosovo, namely, a \nstronger voice in determining allied strategy in the Balkans, \nwhere we have a major investment in interests and values to \nprotect.\n    The United States, to its credit, is an important catalytic \ngovernment, particularly in the Balkans. It needs to remain \ninvolved in working to avoid backsliding so that we do not fall \ninto repeating our past experience in Kosovo, and that we do \nwhat is necessary to ensure that the alliance maintains a \nsufficiently strong posture in Kosovo and indeed the whole of \nthe former Yugoslavia, so that we will be successful, rather \nthan doing just enough to fail or create uncertainty and \nfurther instability, and in this regard I must express some \nconcern as to our involvement in the nonmilitary aspects of the \nKosovo problem.\n    An Albanian friend has commented that the United States has \nwon the war and seems to have disappeared from Kosovo. In \nhelping make things happen in Kosovo, in the vital tasks, \nparticularly building a civil society, the U.S. Government \nseems to me to be largely absent. I am sure you will get a \ncatalogue, and we have already heard a catalogue of all the \nU.S. Government is doing in Kosovo if you ask the question, but \nI believe it is another subject worth seriously looking at.\n    Let me close by saying that in western Europe in the 1940's \nour exit strategy in peace and war was to be successful. If you \nneed an exit strategy for Kosovo, I suggest that is still a \nfitting one."

"","","abramowitz","Hon. Morton I. Abramowitz","    Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee:\n    I appreciate the invitation to discuss Kosovo with you. It is a \nsubject of great political and moral importance. For all the ills of \nWestern policy in the Balkans the past decade--the useless rhetoric, \nthe evasions of reality, the half-way measures--in the end Kosovo \nrepresented an extraordinary allied motivation, effort, and \naccomplishment. The saga is, of course, not over; Kosovo remains a poor \ndisorganized society with a long-term security problem. It is essential \nto the people of Kosovo, to peace in the Balkans, and to the cohesion \nand values of the alliance that our efforts to create a stable and \nreasonable democratic Kosovo be successful. That will require \ncontinuing personnel--military and civilian--resources of sizable \nmagnitude, determination, and some political imagination. There is no \neasy exit strategy, that wonderful Washington phrase which often is \nused to lead democratic countries to less decisive action or no action \nat all and ultimately produces greater cost and suffering. How long \nWestern forces have to stay and the magnitude of the resources needed, \nwill be influenced by what we and our allies do in Kosovo and its wider \nregional setting.\n    I thought it might be most useful to raise at least five important \nquestions surrounding our efforts in Kosovo that need to be aired, and \nto give my answers.

"","","abramowitz","Hon. Morton I. Abramowitz","2. Do Serbs still have a place in Kosovo?"
break,break,break,break
"","","abramowitz","Hon. Morton I. Abramowitz","    In Kosovo our ideals collide with popular fears and profound \nantagonisms. It is not a situation that can be changed overnight.\n    Serbs have been leaving Kosovo for the past twenty years as \nAlbanian predominance in the province increased. The outcome of the war \nsped further departures. Probably half of pre-war Kosovo's two hundred \nthousand Serbs (not all long term residents) fled, partly because of \nAlbanian violence or provocation but in part also because they feared \nto live under Albanian rule or had lost their jobs when Serbian \nadministration ceased.\n    Despite their inhospitable reception in Serbia and the presence of \nKFOR in Kosovo, it is questionable whether many Kosovo Serbs want to \nreturn to Kosovo without jobs to go to (which have largely been taken \nover by Albanians) and without the restoration of Serbian authority. \nThe latter is not likely for a long time to come, if ever. To encourage \nSerbs remaining in Kosovo to stay and those in Serbia to return is no \neasy task. From the perspective of many Albanians the fewer Serbs in \nKosovo the better, and the less likely in the future that Serbia would \nattempt to take back the area.\n    This issue of Serb returns is a tricky one in part because Belgrade \nis deeply involved in the Serb presence in Kosovo. Many Serbs also came \nlate to Kosovo as part of Belgrade's apparatus. In part this issue of \nreturns is also intimately related to the establishment of a serious \nKosovo entity: one with a real court system, a better rule of law, and \nadequate policing--in short a functioning society where there is \nsecurity and predictability. That does not yet exist in Kosovo and \nencouraging Serbs to return at this point is questionable since they \nwill almost certainly end up in enclaves controlled by Belgrade. But \nwhile a stable environment is necessary it is probably not sufficient. \nGetting Serbs to return will also require continuing Western pressure, \nlots of material support, and military and police protection for some \ntime to come. This means:"
break,break,break,break
"","","abramowitz","Hon. Morton I. Abramowitz","  <bullet> that Serbs must somehow be assured security, democratic \n        rights, power sharing in their communities, and political \n        participation outside their communities, however difficult that \n        will be in Albanian areas;"
break,break,break,break
"","","abramowitz","Hon. Morton I. Abramowitz","  <bullet> that Serbs in Kosovo will have to accept that they will have \n        to live in a single Kosovo not ruled by Belgrade. Right now \n        that does not seem to be the case for at least a large number \n        of them; and"
break,break,break,break
"","","abramowitz","Hon. Morton I.

break,break,break,break
"","","abramowitz","Hon. Morton I. Abramowitz","3. Is the uncertainty of the future status of Kosovo inhibiting the \n        political and economic development of the country?"
break,break,break,break
"","","abramowitz","Hon. Morton I. Abramowitz","    The answer to this is almost certainly yes, although it is hard to \nquantify. Economic and political decisions are delayed because the only \ninternational mandate is U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244, which \nsays that Kosovo is part of the FRY and that is used in many quarters \nto contribute to the delay in creating meaningful institutions run by \nthe people of Kosovo. There seems to be a continuing struggle between \nUNMIK in Pristina and the U.N. in New York over the implementation of \nthe mandate and the structure and timing of self-rule.\n    Russia and China are dead set against any change in the \ninternational status of Kosovo. The allies are divided but most \ncontinue to fear that too rapid movement toward Kosovo self-rule and \nany enunciation of Kosovo independence as a goal will imperil the \nviability of Macedonia (although any declaration of Montenegro \nindependence from the FRY would throw even greater doubt on allied \nperspectives of the Kosovo issue) and stir up an international dispute. \nThey all apparently believe that the issue of Kosovo's status could be \nbetter dealt with once Milosevic leaves the scene, that is, there is a \ngreater prospect of keeping Kosovo and Serbia together in some way if \nSerbia has a more democratic government, or conversely, that a more \ndemocratic Serbian government is more likely to accept the secession of \nKosovo or at least a republic status for Kosovo in the FRY.\n    One problem with this approach is that no one is smart enough to \nfigure out when Milosevic will lose power. However significant the \nweaknesses of his regime, his departure could be delayed a long time, \ncreating tension and instability in Kosovo should power and \nresponsibility continue to be denied the Albanians. Moreover, it is not \nat all clear that a post-Milosevic government will have the desire or \nthe political backing to accept a change in Kosovo's status. One could \nreasonably argue that is better for the international community and the \nSerbian opposition to change Kosovo's status while Milosevic is in \ncharge.\n    Another problem is our use of the so-called Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia--the FRY. Everyone knows why that term was used in 1244 and \nnot Serbia. The sad fact is that the FRY is a family enterprise of Mr. \nMilosevic that serves to give his rule some legal patina. Every \nrepublic has gotten out, and the last remaining one--Montenegro--also \nwants out, much to allied discomfiture. The U.S. does not recognize the \nFRY, although we appear to have stopped saying that. Resurrection of \nthe FRY is a highly dubious enterprise even in a post-Milosevic period.\n    It is, however, at this time not possible politically--desirable or \nnot, easier now rather than later--to change the status accorded Kosovo \nby the international community. And that, I believe, is producing a \ndrift in Kosovo and in Allied determination. The people of Kosovo still \ndoes not know what local elections--which are to be held in the \nautumn--mean; and there seems to be, at least among some allies, a \nsense that Kosovo is really just a part of Serbia. It is important for \nthe U.S. to make its views crystal clear to the people of Kosovo and to \nthe world at large: that while the status of Kosovo still has to be \ndetermined, Serbian rule will not return to Kosovo and independence is \na permissible goal once certain conditions about the nature of an \nindependent Kosovo state are met, including a demonstrated commitment \nto minority rights and the adherence to internationally recognized \nborders. Credible elections will also be needed to establish the \nlegitimacy of Kosovo governments and the growing responsibility of \nthose voted into office. In short, we either start to set the rules for \na transition to what may be Kosovo independence or we allow ourselves \nto be hostage to events in Kosovo and the region."

break,break,break,break
"","","abramowitz","Hon. Morton I. Abramowitz","    If Western forces are ever to be withdrawn from Kosovo, clearly \nSerbia and Kosovo must be able to work out some sort of stable \nrelationship. Whether this will be possible and when is, of course, \nhard to predict. The history of the two communities has been a violent \none. Even if attainment of that objective is difficult, it is important \nnot to lose sight of it.\n    We can say a few things about the longer term. First, the \nrelationship can not improve while Milosevic remains in power. He is \nstill trying to preserve the potentiality for Serb rule in Kosovo and \nto undermine UNMIK authority. Business can not be done with him. A \ndifferent type of Serbia will be needed.\n    Second, even if a Serbian Abe Lincoln took charge and offered \nmalice toward none, not one Albanian would support any serious \npolitical tie to Belgrade. Nevertheless, the Albanian leaders of Kosovo \nmust realize, that while independence is their goal, they will still \nhave to coexist with a next-door, much stronger Serbia. They must \nexamine the government that succeeds Milosevic in that light and how \nthey might proceed constructively with its leaders. They also must \nrecognize that a continuing Western military presence in Kosovo could \nbe challenged by domestic considerations in allied nations.\n    Third, much will depend on Europe and what it does in Kosovo, in \nSerbia when it is free of Milosevic, and in the broad Balkan region. \nThe prospects for stability and ultimate reconciliation depend in great \npart both on economic growth in all the countries in the area but also \non their respective relationships with Europe. It will only be possible \nto remove Western troops when both Kosovo and Serbia are bound to \nEuropean institutions in some serious fashion. Whether Europe can rise \nto the occasion and produce a long-term integrative process remains to \nbe seen. Europe has many other things on its mind. But I believe the EU \nincreasingly realizes that connection and Mr. Solana and Mr. Patten \nhave added energy and urgency to EU efforts."

"","","abramowitz","Hon. Morton I. Abramowitz","5. Finally, what is the role of the U.S. in shaping the future of \n        Kosovo?"
break,break,break,break
"","","abramowitz","Hon. Morton I. Abramowitz","    The U.S. was the heart of the Alliance war effort. For the long \nterm, however, it is the EU, as I noted above, which has the central \nrole in ultimately stabilizing the former Yugoslavia. But it can take \nquite a while to get to the long-term and the U.S. remains essential \nfor security and political purposes. The U.S. supplies only 15-20 \npercent of KFOR, but the continued presence of a significant American \nforce is needed to provide the assurance to the Kosovo Albanians that \nSerbian forces will not simply be able one day to walk in and resume \ncontrol. The presence of American forces conveys a similar type message \nto any Serbian government.\n    Certainly until more progress is made in creating new self-\nsustaining political institutions in Kosovo and we see the impact of a \npost-Milosevic government in Belgrade, serious American forces will be \nrequired. While the bulk of the Western military presence will have to \ncome from European countries, it would be a mistake to simply consider \nthis division a burden sharing problem.\n    The nature and role of our forces are also important--whether U.S. \nmilitary efforts are narrowly confined or significantly robust and \ndetermined to get the job done. I note that Kosovo Serbs have \ncomplained a few days ago that British forces do a better job of \nproviding protection to Serbs than American ones. I think the way our \nforces are being used in Kosovo is worth serious review.\n    There is, moreover, an important political purpose served by the \ncontinuing presence of U.S. forces in Kosovo, namely a stronger voice \nin determining Alliance strategy in the Balkans, where we have a major \ninvestment and interests and values to protect. The U.S., to its \ncredit, is an important catalytic element, particularly in the Balkans; \nit needs to remain involved in working to avoid backsliding so that we \ndo not fall into repeating our past experience with Kosovo, and that we \ndo what is necessary to insure that the Alliance maintains a \nsufficiently strong posture in Kosovo, and indeed the whole of the \nformer Yugoslavia, so that we will be successful, rather than doing \njust enough to falter and create uncertainty and further instability.\n    And in this regard I must express some concern as to our \ninvolvement in the non-military aspects of the Kosovo problem. An \nAlbanian friend has commented that the U.S. won the war and seems to \nhave disappeared from Kosovo. In helping make things happen in Kosovo, \nin the vital task of building a civil society the U.S. government seems \nto be largely absent. I am sure you will get a catalogue of all the \nU.S. government is doing in Kosovo if you ask the question, but, I \nbelieve, it is another subject worth seriously looking at in detail.\n    Let me close by saying that in Western Europe in the 1940's our \nexit strategy in war and peace was to be successful. If you need an \nexit strategy for Kosovo I suggest that is also the most fitting one."

"","","smith","Senator Smith"," STATEMENT OF DR."
break,break,break,break
"","","smith","Senator Smith","    Dr. Williams. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is an honor to \nappear before the members of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee to discuss American efforts to build peace in Kosovo \nand throughout the former Yugoslavia.\n    I am particularly grateful to appear before this body, as \nmany of its members have a long and active role in seeking to \nensure a coherent American policy that promotes America's moral \ninterest in human rights and human dignity in the former \nYugoslavia while also protecting America's strategic interest \nin a stable Europe, a democratic Balkan region, and the \npreservation of American military capability and readiness.\n    Before I begin my testimony, I should mention by way of \nbackground that I served as an advisor to the Kosovo Albanian \ndelegation during the Rambouillet/Paris negotiations and to the \nBosnian delegation during the Dayton negotiations, and \npreviously served as a lawyer with the Department of State's \nOffice of Legal Adviser for European Affairs.\n    Let me now turn to a summary of the substance of my written \ntestimony, which I would like to submit for the record. I have \nentitled it, ``Winning the Peace in Kosovo, Time to Formulate a \nStrategy.''\n    To win the peace in Kosovo the United States must \narticulate a clear and attainable objective and develop and \npursue a coherent strategy. To date, the United States has not \narticulated a meaningful objective and has pursued only a \ntactical approach to the crisis in Kosovo and to the broader \ncrisis in the former Yugoslavia. If this vacuum of strategic \npolicy continues, the United States will be unable to extricate \nits military forces from either Bosnia or Kosovo in the \nforeseeable future, and will find itself confronted with \nperpetual conflict and crises, as it has for the past decade in \nthis region.\n    Although some American officials have proclaimed an \nobjective of integrating the Balkan region into the economic \nand democratic structure of Europe, no official has articulated \na clear and realistically attainable objective for Kosovo \nbeyond securing the peace. Rather, they have pursued a policy \nof intentional ambiguity on important matters such as the final \nstatus of Kosovo.\n    Consistent with this policy, the American Government has \npursued only a tactical approach of addressing the consequences \nof the conflict, such as promoting the return of refugees, \nreconstructing homes, drafting legal codes, repairing the \nelectrical grid, and getting children back to school. While \nnecessary first aid, these actions are not sufficient to heal \nthe wounds of the conflict, or to prevent further conflict.\n    Importantly, the American Government has deployed over \n5,000 military personnel to support this Band-Aid approach in \nKosovo. At no time, however, not even during the debate over \nthe Byrd-Warner amendment, has the U.S. Government publicly \narticulated the overall strategy which the deployment of \nAmerican troops is designed to support.\n    This purely tactical approach represents a failure to learn \nthe lessons of the Bosnia conflict, where the absence of a \nstrategic policy has cost the United States billions of dollars \nand tens of thousands of military man-hours. The results of \nthis effort have been that only a fraction of the refugees have \nreturned to their homes, while Serb nationalists still exercise \nsignificant, if not determinative, political influence in the \nRepublic of Srpska which they use to prevent the implementation \nof the Dayton agreement.\n    One reason why the U.S. Government has been unable to move \nbeyond the tactical approach is that since the origination of \nthe conflict American policy has revolved around accommodating \nthe interests of Slobodan Milosevic, and now that he has been \nindicted for crimes against humanity by the Yugoslav War Crimes \nTribunal, he can no longer be relied upon as our partner in \npeace.\n    As a result, rather than now crafting an aggressive \nstrategy to confront Milosevic and deny him the fruits of \nethnic aggression, American diplomats have developed a passive \nshadow strategy of waiting for a democratic transformation in \nSerbia to remove Mr. Milosevic.\n    In formulating a clear and obtainable objective for U.S. \npolicy, it is necessary to assess the costs of losing the \npeace, assess the causes of the conflict, and understand the \nrequirements for further peace-building. The consequence of \nlosing the peace in Kosovo will be a politically radical Kosovo \npopulation, devoid of Serbian or other minorities, which is, de \nfacto if not de jure, partitioned along the Mitrovica fault \nline, leaving the Kosovo Albanian controlled territory to seek \nunification with Albania and/or the Albanian areas of \nMacedonia.\n    Senator Biden. Excuse me, Mr. Chairman. What do you mean by \nlosing? Does your little scenario mean that there are no NATO \nforces any longer in Kosovo?\n    Dr. Williams. It means failing to win the peace, withdrawal \nof NATO forces, and the failure to democratize properly within \nKosovo.\n    Senator Biden. You think that this would result in the \nKosovars in control of Kosovo? Good luck.\n    Dr. Williams. Well, on a good day.\n    Senator Biden. They would last about a day.\n    Dr. Williams. I did not want to be too pessimistic, but I \nwill get to that more pessimistic part in a few moments.\n    The Kosovo crisis is largely the result of the failure to \nwin the peace in Bosnia, the failure to politically confront \nMilosevic before the use of force becomes necessary, and the \nfailure to ensure equal protection of rights and the security \nof Albanian and Serbian ethnic groups.\n    Now, to create the circumstances necessary for winning the \npeace in Kosovo, the United States must immediately undertake a \nprocess for determining the final status in Kosovo. The \napproach of delaying the resolution of Kosovo's final status in \nhopes of a near-term democratic transition in Serbia is flawed, \nas either Mr. Milosevic will be replaced by a strong \nnationalistic force that would pursue a similar or even more \naggressive policy toward Kosovo.\n    And when over time a more democratic force will come to \npower, it will be unlikely to cope with the responsibilities \nand burdens of addressing the Kosovo crisis as well as the \nmultitude of other tasks that will confront them as they try to \npolitically and economically reconstruct Serbia. In fact, Mr. \nMilosevic and not the democratic opposition should be held \npolitically accountable for Serbia's inevitable loss of Kosovo.\n    The second important element is to exercise American \nleadership to coordinate and to constrain the actions of our \nallies, in particular the French, who seem to have embarked \nupon a separate policy of engagement with Kosovo Serbian \npolitical forces based on the principal of maintaining peace \nthrough the accommodation of hard-line local Serbian interests, \nwhich we know are directed from Belgrade. It is also necessary \nfor the United States to take the lead in containing the \ninfluence of Russia.\n    To win the peace in Kosovo, the American objective should \nbe to create an economically and politically self-sufficient \nmulti-ethnic Kosovo capable of defending itself against \npossible further acts of Serbian State-sponsored ethnic \naggression.\n    In return, this entity must protect the rights of minority \npopulations resident on its territory and act responsibly \ntoward its neighbors. The strategy for accomplishing this \nobjective should be for the United States, supported by its \nallies, to manage a process of intermediate sovereignty and \nearned independence for the people of Kosovo.\n    This process would entail arrangements whereby the people \nof Kosovo for a period of 3 to 5 years would be entitled to \nexercise specified sovereign rights while under the continuing \nmandate of Resolution 1244, and undertake certain essential \npolitical commitments. After this period, Kosovo would be \nentitled, subject to an internationally conducted referendum \nwithin Kosovo, to seek recognition from the international \ncommunity.\n    During the interim period, the people of Kosovo would \nexercise, in cooperation with UNMIK, complete legislative, \nexecutive, and judicial control over their internal affairs. \nThe people of Kosovo would also be entitled to begin to conduct \ntheir own international affairs, and to appoint international \nrepresentatives.\n    In exchange for the exercise of these sovereign rights, \nKosovo would be required to implement specific guarantees that \nit would protect the rights of all minority populations within \nits territory, respect the territorial integrity of neighboring \nstates such as Macedonia and Albania, and accept its borders as \nconfirmed by the 1974 Yugoslav constitution. Compliance with \nthese obligations should be measured and assessed by an \nindependent international entity.\n    At the end of this interim period, the criteria for \nrecognition of Kosovo would be based upon an assessment of the \nfulfillment of these commitments. If recognized by the \ninternational community, Kosovo would remain bound by these \ncommitments.\n    Now, as the most recent crisis in Kosovo is but a \ncontinuation of the Yugoslav crisis begun in 1991, it is also \nnecessary to establish objectives and strategies for winning \nthe peace throughout the territory of the former Yugoslavia, \nwhich I go into in more detail in my written testimony. To win \nback the peace in Bosnia it is necessary to acknowledge the \nnature of the Dayton Accords as a flawed peace agreement and \neither renegotiate or evolve these accords in a manner which \ndeconstructs the resulting institutions and attributes of \nMilosevic's efforts to partition Bosnia.\n    To prevent the conflict in Montenegro, it is necessary to \ndemonstrate tangible benefits to democracy on a political path \nseparate from that of Serbia. Montenegro must be provided with \nsecurity guarantees, and Serbia must be confronted with clear \nwarnings of economic and political sanctions in the event it \nsponsors a coup or other covert action in Montenegro. Moreover, \nMontenegro must be engaged in the Kosovo peace-building \nprocess.\n    To win the conflict in Serbia, it is necessary to promote a \ndemocratic transition beyond the current institutionalized \npolitical opposition. This will require a series of \ntransitions. The Yugoslav tribunal's indictment of the top \nleadership should be maximally utilized to delegitimize and \ndiscredit the current nationalist regime, and America should \nlead its allies in isolating Milosevic and his accomplices.\n    America should make clear that Serbia will be barred from \ninternational assistance until Milosevic is not only removed \nfrom power, but also surrendered to The Hague.\n    In conclusion, the lack of a strategic policy for bringing \na lasting peace to Yugoslavia has resulted in hundreds of \nthousands of deaths, the displacement of over a million \nrefugees, the degradation of United States and NATO military \nforces, diplomatic strains within the American-European \nalliance, and a diversion of resources and attention from other \nareas of strategic importance.\n    Unless the United States wishes to create a permanent \npeacekeeping force in the region, it must develop an aggressive \nstrategy for each zone of conflict in the former Yugoslavia. \nFor Kosovo, that policy should be one of intermediate \nsovereignty and earned independence.\n    I thank the members of the committee for this opportunity \nto testify."

To date, the U.S. Government has not articulated a meaningful \nobjective, and has pursued only a tactical approach to the crisis in \nKosovo, and to the broader crisis in the former Yugoslavia.

In return this entity must \nprotect the rights of minority populations resident on its territory \nand act responsibly toward its neighbors. The strategy for \naccomplishing this objective should be for the U.S., supported by its \nallies, to manage a process of intermediate sovereignty and earned \nindependence for the people of Kosovo.\n    As the most recent crisis in Kosovo is but a continuation of the \nYugoslav crisis begun in 1991, it is also necessary to establish \nobjectives and strategies for winning the peace throughout the \nterritory of the former Yugoslavia."

At no time, \nhowever, has the U.S. Government articulated the overall strategy which \nthese tactical efforts, or which the deployment of American troops is \ndesigned to support, or has it demonstrated how the tactical efforts \nand the actions of the military forces are interrelated as part of a \nlarger plan.\n    While necessary to repair and redress the consequences of the \nKosovo conflict, the tactical efforts currently pursued by the U.S. \nGovernment, absent a strategic approach, are insufficient to build the \nfoundation for a lasting peace in Kosovo or the former Yugoslavia. Even \nif the U.S. successfully restores electricity, reconstitutes the police \nforce, redrafts the school curriculum and trains an impartial \njudiciary, the U.S. still will not have resolved the underlying causes \nof the conflict, which emanate from Belgrade and have become deeply \nrooted in the Kosovo political context. To win the peace it is \nnecessary to address the fact that the primary cause of the conflict \nand the continued instability in the region is the use of ethnic \naggression and political oppression by Milosevic's Serbian nationalist \nregime as a means of perpetuating its political power."

break,break,break,break
"","","williams","Dr. Paul R. Williams","    In fact, if pursued in a policy vacuum, even these limited tactical \nobjectives are unlikely to be met. In the case of Bosnia, the absence \nof a strategic approach has meant that despite billions of dollars in \ninternational assistance and tens of thousands of military man-hours \nfew Bosniac refugees have been able to return to their homes in Serb \ncontrolled Republika Srpska; there is only the most minimal freedom of \nmovement across the inter-entity boundary line; Serb nationalists still \nexercise significant if not determinative political influence in the \nRepublika Srpska; the Bosniac-Croat Federation and the Bosnian central \ngovernment are politically gridlocked along ethnic lines; the economy \ncontinues to teeter on the brink of collapse; and the Bosniac political \ncommunity has become polarized.\\6\\\n    More importantly, the rush to pursue tactical objectives on their \nown is likely to undermine the prospects for a meaningful peace, as has \nbeen the case in Bosnia. For instance, in an effort to demonstrate \nmovement toward the tactical objectives of the Dayton Accords the U.S. \nGovernment essentially directed the OSCE to hold elections even though \nthe circumstances all but precluded the possibility of free and fair \nelections. After 104% of the population voted, the OSCE, again under \npressure from the U.S. Government, declared these elections to have \nbeen substantially free and fair.\\7\\ As a result, hard-line Serbian \nrepresentatives took up power in the Republika Srpska institutions and \nthe Serbian section of the Bosnian parliament, and Momcilo Krajisnik \nwas elected as the Serb representative to the Bosnian Presidency. From \nthis vantage point, and. with support in the Bosnian parliament and the \nRepublika Srpska, Mr. Krajisnik continued to pursue the policy of a de \nfacto partition of Bosnia and ethnic segregation which he had \norchestrated during the campaign of ethnic aggression. After completing \nhis term, Mr. Krajisnik was indicted by the Yugoslav Tribunal for \ncrimes of genocide which he had committed prior to being elected to the \nBosnian Presidency.\n    The continued absence of a strategic policy for Bosnia has created \nconditions where even just this last May an Italian military contingent \nassigned to provide security to a convoy of Bosniac women returning to \nvisit graves in Bratunac stood by while Serb protesters stoned the \nBosniac women in their care. Moreover, growing weary of the inability \nof international efforts to secure their return home, increasing \nnumbers of refugees and internally displaced persons are engaging in \nspontaneous returns. Even then, the international community is only \ncapable of providing reconstruction assistance to approximately 10 \npercent of these returnees.\\8\\\nAffirmatively Declining to Formulate or Declare a Strategy\n    As a consequence of the absence of a strategic approach to the \nKosovo crisis, and in light of concerns about the proper use of U.S. \nmilitary forces and the extent of European financial and military \ncommitments, Senators Byrd and Warner recently unsuccessfully sought to \ninsert a provision into the Military Construction Appropriations Act, \n2001. This provision would have terminated funding for the continued \ndeployment of U.S. ground combat troops in Kosovo after July 1, 2001, \nunless the President sought and received congressional authorization to \ncontinue such deployment.\\9\\ A similar measure was adopted by the \nHouse.\n    Notably, during the debate over the Byrd-Warner provision the \nExecutive Branch objected to the withdrawal of American troops on the \ngrounds that a number of negative consequences would occur, including \nstraining our relations with our European allies, undermining the \neffectiveness of NATO and usurping the constitutional authority of the \nExecutive Branch. At no time, however, did the Executive branch offer \nan affirmative public explanation as to what purpose the troops were \nserving in Kosovo, beyond that of ``providing security.'' Notably, the \nExecutive branch failed to articulate the specific policy which \nrequired that the troops be placed in harms way, or to establish a \nstandard by which the success of the mission could be measured and \nAmerican troops withdrawn. In fact, according to a recent International \nCrisis Group report, the primary mission of American forces in Kosovo \nis ``force protection,'' \\10\\ which is to say that the American \nmilitary forces in Kosovo are there to protect the American military \nforces in Kosovo. Such a state of affairs could only occur in a policy \nvacuum."

Moreover, numerous Chinese, Greek, \nNigerian, and Russian officials have met with Milosevic and other \nindicted war criminals in Serbia. These allies and partners in our \npeace effort bolster the interests of such states as Cuba, Iraq, Libya \nand Syria (all of which maintain full diplomatic relations with Serbia) \nin undermining U.S. policy in the Balkan region.\n    Most troubling is the fact that our French allies seem to have \nembarked on a separate policy of engagement with Kosovo Serbian \npolitical forces which is based on the principle of maintaining peace \nthrough the accommodation of hard-line local Serbian interests--which \nare dictated by Milosevic's nationalist regime in Belgrade.\n    Under these circumstances it is imperative that the U.S. assert its \nleadership role in the international efforts to bring lasting peace to \nthe territory of the former Yugoslavia as absent such leadership our \nEuropean allies are incapable of maintaining a united or coherent front \nin the face of either Milosevic or a resurgent Russia.\n    In light of the risks of losing the peace, the geopolitical context \nof the conflict, and the above assessment of the causes of the conflict \nand circumstances necessary for peacebuilding, the American policy \nobjective should be to create an economically and politically self-\nsufficient Kosovo entity capable of defending itself against possible \nfurther acts of Serbian state sponsored ethnic aggression, and which \nprotects the rights of minority populations resident on its territory \nand acts responsibly toward its neighbors.

"","","williams","Dr. Paul R.

The people of Kosovo would also be entitled to begin to conduct \ntheir own international affairs and appoint international \nrepresentatives.\n    In exchange for the exercise of these sovereign rights, Kosovo \nwould be required to implement specific guarantees that it would \nprotect the rights of all minority populations within its territory, \nrespect the territorial integrity of neighboring states such as \nMacedonia and Albania, renounce any intention of political or \nterritorial association with Albania, and accept its borders as \nconfirmed by the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution. Compliance with these \nobligations should be measured and assessed by an independent \ninternational entity. While UNMIK should be consulted as to its \nassessment of Kosovo's compliance its efforts must remain focused on \nthe tactical objectives set out in resolution 1244.\n    At the end of this interim period the criteria for recognition of \nKosovo would include the traditional legal criteria of territory, \npopulation, government and capacity to conduct international relations, \nas well as the additional political criteria of whether it had \nprotected the rights of minority populations within its territory, \nrespected the territorial integrity of Macedonia and Albania, rejected \nany political or territorial association with Albania, and maintained \nthe status of its borders. Once recognized by the international \ncommunity, Kosovo would remain bound by these commitments.\n    This approach to winning the peace in Kosovo is based on principles \nof international law, which provide that all self-identified groups \nwith a coherent identity and connection to a defined territory are \nentitled to collectively determine their political destiny in a \ndemocratic fashion, and to be free from systematic persecution. In \ncases where self-identified groups were effectively denied their right \nto democratic self-government, and are consequently subjected to gross \nviolations of their human rights, as has been the case with Kosovo, \nthey are entitled to seek their own international status in order to \nensure the protection of those rights.\n    The case for intermediate sovereignty is further supported by: (1) \nthe legal and factual similarity between Kosovo and the other Republics \nof the former Yugoslavia that were deemed by the international \ncommunity to be entitled to international recognition; (2) the legal \nprecedent of earned recognition established by the international \ncommunity in recognizing Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and \nMacedonia; (3) the fact that Yugoslavia has dissolved, and the \ninternational community has rejected Serbia/Montenegro's claim to \ncontinue its international legal personality; (4) the historic fact \nthat Kosovo, while legitimately part of Yugoslavia, has never been \nlegitimately incorporated into Serbia; (5) the fact that the people of \nKosovo have been subjected to ethnic aggression; and (6) recent \nprecedent set by the Northern Ireland Peace Agreement and others."

break,break,break,break
"","","williams","Dr. Paul R. Williams","    To win the peace in Kosovo it is necessary to recognize that the \nrecent crisis in Kosovo is but a continuation of the Yugoslav crisis \nwhich began in 1991. As such, it is necessary to link the peace efforts \nin Kosovo to those in the other former Yugoslav Republics, and in \nparticular to establish objectives and strategies for winning the peace \nthroughout the territory of the former Yugoslavia.\n    To secure the peace in Croatia, it is necessary to continue to work \nwith the new government and the Yugoslav Tribunal to ensure the \nindictment and transfer to the Hague of all high level officials \nresponsible for war crimes against Serb and Bosniac populations. It is \nfurther necessary to provide the new Croatian government with the \npolitical support, and when necessary political pressure, to severe the \npolitical and financial links between Croatia and Bosnian Croat \npolitical forces which continue to harbor an interest in a partitioned \nBosnia.\n    To win back the peace in Bosnia it is necessary to acknowledge the \nnature of the Dayton accords as a flawed peace resulting from America's \nfailure to seriously confront Slobodan Milosevic or to truncate and \nroll back political gains, achieved through ethnic aggression. This \neffort must involve a three phase process. First, the U.S. Government \nmust discontinue its policy of moral equivalence and equal blame among \nthe parties, which undermines its efforts to constructively engage \nBosniac and certain Croat forces in the peacebuilding process. Second, \nthe U.S. Government must acknowledge the Dayton agreement was never \nmeant to be static, but rather that it was designed and intended to \nevolve with changing political circumstances. And third, the U.S. \nGovernment must seek to evolve the Dayton agreement in a manner which \ndeconstructs the resulting institutions and attributes of Milosevic's \nefforts to partition Bosnia along ethnic lines, including the gradual \nerasure of the inter-entity boundary line, the removal of the \ninstitutionalized ethnic veto, and the dissolution of most of the \nRepublika Srpska political institutions--which are regularly used to \norganize actions which undermine or inhibit the reintegration of \nBosnia.\n    To prevent conflict in Montenegro it is necessary to demonstrate \ntangible benefits to democracy and a political path separate from that \nof Serbia.\\20\\ Montenegro must be provided security guarantees and \nSerbia must be confronted with clear warnings of economic and political \nsanctions in the event it sponsors a coup or other covert action in \nMontenegro.\\21\\ Moreover, Montenegro must be engaged in the Kosovo \npeacebuilding process.\n    To secure the peace in Macedonia it is necessary to ensure \ncontinued economic growth and the resolution of outstanding political \ndisputes with Greece. Most important is the need to further integrate \nthe Macedonian Albanian population into Macedonia's political and \neconomic infrastructure.\n    To win the conflict in Serbia and silence the engine of aggression \nin the former Yugoslavia it is necessary to promote a democratic \ntransition beyond the current institutionalized political opposition. \nThis will require a series of transitions, with the first likely \nincluding members of the current opposition, but with subsequent \ngovernments including more genuinely moderate elements that accurately \nreflect the views of the oppressed and silenced mainstream population \ncommitted to a regionally responsible Serbia--such as the ones \ncurrently driving the Otpor student movement. The Yugoslav Tribunal's \nindictment of the top leadership should be maximally utilized to \ndelegitimze and discredit the current nationalist regime, and America "

break,break,break,break
"","","smith","Senator Smith","    Mr. Bugajski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for \ninviting me today to speak on Kosovo, past, present, and \nfuture. It is an honor to be here. I would simply summarize my \nwritten statement, which is deliberately concise to begin with, \nand so I am going to be very brief.\n    Let me just say that since the liberation and occupation of \nKosovo by NATO forces in June 1999, a year ago, both \nconstructive and negative developments have been evident on the \nterritory as a result of both internal factors and external \nfactors.\n    Let me just point out some of the positives that we \nmentioned already, but I think it is worth underscoring. On the \nsecurity side, Kosovo has witnessed the expulsion of repressive \nSerb security forces, and the successful return of over 1 \nmillion Kosovar Albanian refugees. NATO, despite some of the \nsecurity concerns vis-a-vis the minority groups, is effectively \nsafeguarding the territory from Yugoslav or Serbian military \nreintervention.\n    Second, on the reconstruction side, some basic \nreconstruction work has been accomplished, especially in \nproviding shelter, food, medical aid, and other services to the \ndestitute. Some initiatives have begun in encouraging \ndevelopment of small businesses and in identifying key \ninfrastructural projects over the coming years. Efforts are \nalso underway to rebuild the educational system, the health \ncare system, the energy network, and public administration.\n    This is all to the good. However, what I would like to \nfocus on are the shortcomings, and I think there are four major \nshortcomings with the U.N. mandate and with our operation \nthere. First, I would call it political paralysis. There is \ncurrently no legitimate Kosovar Albanian authority, and this \ncontributes to paralyzing and polarizing the development of \npolitical institutions. The creation of a Kosovar Advisory \nCouncil under the supervision of U.N. Special Representative \nBernard Kouchner has not filled the political vacuum.\n    Second, criminality and corruption threaten the security of \nresidents. They perpetuate the climate of revenge against \nminority Serbs and undermine the emergence of a democratic \nsystem. In addition, Milosevic's special security forces and \nparamilitaries sometimes in plain clothes continue to operate \nin Kosovo, deliberately provoking violence to discredit \ninternational institutions, to undermine the longevity of the \nNATO mission, and to discount any realistic possibility of \nKosovar self-government.\n    Third, international failures. I would say Kosovo has \nwitnessed a number of institutional shortcomings by \ninternational agencies. For example, lack of serious \nreconstruction resources, insufficient number of international \npolice officers, turf battles between international \norganizations, and the creation of deliberative councils \nwithout any ultimate authority or decisionmaking power.\n    There have also been persistent delays in training and \ndeploying an indigenous police force and establishing a \ncredible and professional judiciary system that could enforce \nlaw and order on the territory.\n    Fourth, and I think the most important failing, and it has \nbeen mentioned already, but again is worth underscoring, is the \nlack of final legal status for Kosovo as an independent state. \nWestern leaders still believe that postponing the decision on \nKosovo's status will allow for democratic changes to take place \ninside Serbia and enable some new relationship to emerge \nbetween Serbia and Kosovo.\n    In the interim, and regardless of whether such a rosy \nscenario actually materializes, NATO may be faced with \nescalating anger amongst the Albanian community if the United \nNations insists on preserving Kosovo within Serbia. As we know, \nthe vast majority of Albanians support statehood, irrespective \nof any possible leadership changes, or regime changes in \nBelgrade.\n    For the indefinite future, Kosovo it looks will remain an \ninternational ward without any inspiring vision for its future \nstatus, but such a scenario has raised, I believe, serious \nquestions about the self-determination of Kosovo's population \nand the instabilities that could be generated by any planned \nreintegration into Serbia.\n    Indeed, I would say a valid argument can be made that in \norder to avoid future destabilization or permanent dependency \non outside agencies self-determination and independence for \nKosovo should be the primary objective of international \nleaders.\n    Such a step could have several positive ramifications. \nFirst, it would restore Kosovar confidence in the international \ncommunity and help preclude potential radicalization of \nAlbanian politics as long-term ambiguity on the status question \ncan undermine the democrats and favor the demagogues.\n    Most policymakers unfortunately still adhere to the \nconventional wisdom that an independent Kosovo would \ndestabilize the Balkans. In reality, it seems to me it is the \nforcible maintenance of Yugoslavia in which we are now ready \naccomplices that continues to generate instability.\n    Second, protection. Acceptance of future independence can \nundercut the threat of a new Serbian takeover by delegitimizing \nBelgrade's incessant provocations on the territory. \nAdditionally, criteria and timetables for a democratic \nindependent state will give both the internationalists and the \nlocals a concrete goal to which political, institutional, and \neconomic reconstruction can be directed.\n    And third, Kosovo's statehood can also help resolve the \nwider Albanian question in the Balkans. I believe instead of \nprovoking calls for a greater Albania which we keep hearing, \nsuch a step could actually pacify the more radical Albanian \ndemands, allow Europe to increase its positive influences by \ndealing with Kosovo as a country in its own right, and \ndelegitimize any potential threat to Macedonian or Montenegran \nterritory.\n    Over the coming year I believe the international community \nneeds to focus attention on two overriding questions in Kosovo, \npolitical legitimacy and international dependency. First, \npolitical legitimacy. In line with the resolution of its status \nquestion, Kosovo will need a new indigenous constitution that \ncan help concentrate political energy, give credence to \nlegality, and provide a more solid basis for democratic \ndevelopment.\n    All major political players in Kosovo evidently support \nsuch an approach, as it would create the foundations of \nstatehood. The organs of government, including the \nconstitutional assembly, would then acquire the confidence of \nthe public and the commitment of all major political leaders.\n    Second, international dependence. A dependency relationship \nhas emerged between the Kosovars and international \ninstitutions. That may become more difficult to overcome the \nlonger the current stalemate exists. Moreover, I believe such a \nrelationship could seriously threaten the development of \nindigenous institutions and democratic procedures.\n    To counter such a phenomenon, a comprehensive election \nprocess for both local and national elections is essential \nthrough a campaign of voter registration, political party \ndevelopment, and civic education, and here I think the United \nStates can play a major role. This could help establish \nstructure, legitimacy, and authority for elected Kosovar \nleaders. Local and central Kosovar authorities must then obtain \nthe authority and resources to govern, and not simply to \nconsult with international agencies.\n    Above all, I believe there needs to be clarity as to the \npowers of the proposed local and central government, its \nrelationship with the interim U.N. authorities, and its \nindependence from the Serbian and/or Yugoslav regime.\n    Thank you very much. That concludes my summary."

break,break,break,break
"","","bugajski","Janusz Bugajski","  <bullet> Criminality: The problem of criminalization and the lack of \n        the rule of law has become widespread in Kosova. Corruption and \n        crime threaten the security of residents, perpetuate a climate \n        of revenge against minority Serbs, and undermine the emergence \n        of a democratic system. Such a phenomenon also serves those who \n        argue that the Kosovars are not prepared for self-government or \n        statehood. In addition, Serbian special forces and \n        paramilitaries continued to operate in Kosova, deliberately \n        provoking violence to discredit international institutions, to \n        undermine the longevity of the NATO mission, and to discount \n        any realistic possibility of Kosovar self-government."
break,break,break,break
"","","bugajski","Janusz Bugajski","  <bullet> International Failings: Kosova has witnessed a number of \n        institutional shortcomings by international agencies. This has \n        been visible in a lack of serious reconstruction resources, an \n        insufficient number of international police officers, turf \n        battles between international organizations, the undercutting \n        of embryonic Albanian local authorities, and the creation of \n        deliberative councils without any ultimate authority or \n        decision-making powers. There have also been persistent delays \n        in the training and deployment of an indigenous police force \n        and the establishment of a credible and professional judiciary \n        system that could enforce law and order on the territory."
break,break,break,break
"","","bugajski","Janusz Bugajski","  <bullet> Status Question: The most important failing is the lack of \n        final legal status for Kosova as an independent state. Western \n        leaders believe that postponing the decision on Kosova's status \n        will allow for democratic changes to take place inside Serbia \n        and enable a new relationship to emerge between Serbia and \n        Kosova once Yugoslav President Milosevic is ousted. However, in \n        the interim and regardless of whether such a rosy scenario \n        actually materializes, NATO may be faced with escalating anger \n        among the Albanian community if the U.N. insists on preserving \n        Kosova within Serbia. The vast majority of Albanians support \n        statehood for Kosova irrespective of any possible leadership \n        changes in Belgrade."
break,break,break,break
"","","bugajski","Janusz Bugajski","    For the indefinite future Kosova will remain an international ward, \nwithout any inspiring vision for its future status. The U.N. mandate in \nKosova is ultimately designed to return the region to Belgrade's \njurisdiction. A large-scale international presence will continue until \nconditions have been met for a peaceful reintegration of the territory. \nBut such a scenario has raised serious questions about the self-\ndetermination of Kosova's population and the instabilities that could \nbe generated by any planned reintegration into Serbia. A valid argument \ncan be made that in order to avoid future destabilization or permanent \ndependance on outside agencies, self-determination and independence for \nKosova should be the primary objective of international leaders. Such a \nstep could have several positive ramifications."
break,break,break,break
"","","bugajski","Janusz Bugajski","  <bullet> Stabilization: It would restore Kosovar confidence in the \n        ``international community'' and help preclude a potential \n        radicalization of Albanian politics as long-term ambiguity on \n        the status question can undermine the region's democrats and \n        favor its demagogues. The ``non-status'' stalemate or the \n        proposed return of Kosova to Serbian or Yugoslav control may \n        exacerbate the problems already faced by international actors \n        in guaranteeing security and building credible local \n        institutions. Most policy makers still adhere to the \n        conventional wisdom that an independent Kosova will destabilize \n        the Balkans. Comparable arguments were employed a decade ago in \n        opposition to Slovenian and Croatian statehood. In reality, it \n        is the forcible maintenance of Yugoslavia that continues to \n        generate instability."

"","","bugajski","Janusz Bugajski","  <bullet> Protection: Acceptance of future independence can undercut \n        the threat of a new Serbian takeover by deligitimizing \n        Belgrade's incessant provocations on the territory. \n        Additionally, criteria and timetables for a democratic \n        independent state will give both the internationals and the \n        locals a concrete goal toward which political, institutional, \n        and economic reconstruction can be directed."

"","","bugajski","Janusz Bugajski","  <bullet> Political Legitimacy: In line with the resolution of its \n        ``status'' question, Kosova will need a new indigenous \n        constitution that can help concentrate political energy, give \n        credence to legality, and provide a more solid basis for \n        democratic development. All major political players in Kosova \n        evidently support such an approach as it would create the \n        foundations of statehood. The organs of government, including a \n        constitutional assembly, would then acquire the confidence of \n        the public and the commitment of all major political players. \n        In this context, extremist parties advocating ultra-\n        nationalist, anti-minority, and authoritarian solutions would \n        be exposed and marginalized so that they do not undermine the \n        body politic of the new state."

Indeed, during the next two to three \n        years Kosova can establish all the elements and qualifications \n        for statehood. The Prishtina government will of course have to \n        renounce any territorial aspirations and sign treaties with its \n        three Slavic neighbors, and commit itself to democratic \n        pluralism, the rule of law, a market economy, and European \n        integration."

"smith","Senator Smith","bugajski","Janusz Bugajski","    Thank you all.\n    I wonder if any of you would care to respond to, I think \nboth of us, what both of us were saying, that if we actually \njust come forward and say we are now for independence, and that \nis the stated goal and the condition of the United States \ncontinued presence there, what dynamic does that set in place?\n    Ambassador Abramowitz. I will give you my perspective. I \nthink while one must have definite objectives, that one cannot \nalso depart from political reality. I believe it is very \nimportant, as I said in the testimony, to make it clear that--\nand this the United States can do without necessarily creating \na division in the alliance. Make it clear that Serbian rule \nwill never return to Kosovo. It does not now have to create, I \nbelieve, a problem within the alliance and within the \ninternational community by trying to change U.N. Resolution \n1244.\n    But I think the most important thing to do over the next \nyear is basically what Mr. Bugajski just said, to start to work \nto create Albanian institutions, and to give Albanians charge \nto begin that process. That is not an easy process, because the \nleadership is absent in many ways, but that, to me, is the \nbeginning of the process of establishing the movement toward \nwhat I think will be eventual independence without creating an \nenormous brouhaha in the international community.\n    So that is my view on it, is that we have to have that, I \nthink, as an ultimate objective, but we have to move there with \ndeference to what the circumstances are in the international \ncommunity, and particularly within the alliance. That may seem \na little faint-hearted, but that is what I feel at this time."
"smith","Senator Smith","smith","Senator Smith","    That is a very valuable insight.\n    Dr. Williams. Addressing that question, there would be \nthree consequences of articulating a policy of conditional \nindependence. The first would be that it would create an \nincentive, or at least a possibility of incentivizing the \nKosovo Albanian population to behave in a more moderate and \nless radical fashion.\n    Generally a significant percentage of the population are by \nnature moderate. However, the conflict and near apartheid of \nthe last 10 years has resulted in a radicalization of that \npopulation. Denying them their aspirations for independence has \nto date played into the hands of the more radical elements.\n    The second is that it would help us to create a political \nreality with our European allies. We deferred to our European \nallies in 1991. We had the conflict in Croatia and in Bosnia. \nWe stepped in, tried to fix the problem. We deferred to our \nEuropean allies at the initiation of the Kosovo conflict. \nAgain, the American Government had to step in, fix the problem \nthrough the use of force.\n    We are now deferring to our European allies on winning the \npeace in Kosovo. It is not going to work. The Americans have to \ntake a leadership role, and independence, or conditional \nindependence or some other forward-thinking policy would have \nthe effect, I think, of galvanizing the Europeans. They would \nobject. There would be difficulties, but we could bring them \nalong with us.\n    Third, and probably most importantly, it would lay the \nblame for the loss of Kosovo, which will occur 3 years, 5 \nyears, 10 years from now. Sooner or later Kosovo will be lost \nto the people and the Republic of Serbia. It would lay this \nblame at the foot of Milosevic.\n    It could then be used by the democratic opposition, which \nare very pluralistic and diverse, in a good way and in a bad \nway, but it would also remove it from the tasks that any \ngenuine opposition will have to deal with once they come into \npower in a post Milosevic regime. If a truly democratic \nopposition takes power and then gives the Kosovars the right to \nvote for independence, they will lose Kosovo, and you will see \na transition back to more nationalist Serbian politics."
"smith","Senator Smith","smith","Senator Smith","    Mr. Bugajski.\n    Mr. Bugajski. Yes. Just to reiterate what Paul has said, I \nwould say that it would send a very clear signal to Belgrade \nand to the Serbian people that basically focus on your domestic \nissues, Kosovo is out of bounds. This is now an international \nissue. We are moving toward independence, whatever the steps.\n    Paradoxically, though, I think if it is important to the \nSerbs--in other words, Kosovo is the heartland, so to speak--\nthen it would further delegitimize the Milosevic regime, \nbecause it would be clear Milosevic had lost the territory. If \nit is not important to Serbs, and according to recent public \nopinion polls it does not even figure amongst the six top \nissues that concern ordinary Serbs, then it really does not \nmatter to them, in other words, we may have exaggerated the \nimportance of Kosovo to the Serbs.\n    So either way, I think we will win vis-a-vis Belgrade."
"smith","Senator Smith","smith","Senator Smith","    So if we set up this process, establish the \ndemocratic institutions, and define the goal as conditional \nindependence, if you could all speak briefly to the collateral \nconsequence to Macedonia and Bosnia, what does it mean to them?\n    Ambassador Abramowitz. I think one should not be too \ncategorical. There is a lot we do not know. There is a lot of \nthings that can happen. For example, I think--take the case of \nGreece. I think if--and this is no reason for not doing it, but \nif Kosovo moved toward independence I think Greece would have a \nfit."
"smith","Senator Smith","smith","Senator Smith","    Greece would what?\n    Ambassador Abramowitz. Have a fit. What Greece would do in \nthat case, I do not know, and the situation in Macedonia is \nuncertain. There are a lot of Albanians who recognize they do \nnot want conflict. They want to try to make Macedonia work. \nThere are a lot of people in Macedonia who have had longer term \nmeans.\n    My own view is that we can proceed at some point toward \nindependence and still maintain the viability of Macedonia, but \nI think it will require an awful lot of effort and an awful lot \nof attention to what is happening in Macedonia internally, and \nI do not say that with great confidence, and I do not think \nanybody can speak with great confidence on this subject. It is \na legitimate concern to be worried about, but I believe--my own \nbelief is, it can be managed.\n    But it has to be very significantly thought through, the \nthings you have to do to make sure that nothing untoward \nhappens in terms of the stability of Macedonia."
"smith","Senator Smith","smith","Senator Smith","    Do you have a brief comment, Dr. Williams?\n    Dr. Williams. I think there would be important consequences \nboth for Bosnia and Macedonia. In Bosnia it would demonstrate \nthe West's willingness to roll back the gains of ethnic \naggression. We need to resurrect the peace in Bosnia. One way \nof doing that is to evolve the Dayton Accords. Working on \nconditional independence for Kosovo would set a precedence for \nmanaging and somehow constructing a new process in Bosnia.\n    In Macedonia, as Ambassador Abramowitz has pointed out, it \nis highly unstable. There are three options. Either we manage \neventual independence of Kosovo, we keep our troops in Kosovo \nindefinitely, or we withdraw our troops and there is a process \nof de facto independence, which we will not be able to regulate \nand which will be met with aggression by Serbian forces. It \nbrings us back to 1998 all over again."
"smith","Senator Smith","smith","Senator Smith","    Mr. Bugajski.\n    Mr. Bugajski. I personally think a little bit what Paul was \nsaying, that Macedonia does remain a great unknown in terms of \nits internal development and ethnic developments. However, I do \nbelieve that the nonindependence option for Kosovo, either \nlong-term international dependency or reintegration into \nYugoslavia, does actually encourage radical elements, \nparticularly those factions that favor a Greater Albania, and I \nthink they could become more important and active and even gain \nsome popular support if they see the international community is \nnot favoring independence for Kosovo, and they could spread, \nlet us say, their message, their activities to part of \nMacedonia.\n    At this point I do not believe most Albanians in Macedonia \nwould want to join either Kosovo or Albania. A lot, of course, \ndepends on the development of internal political relations \nwithin Macedonia, and this is the key, of course, in the south \nBalkans we should be focusing on."
"smith","Senator Smith","smith","Senator Smith","    We are very pleased to be joined--much \nearlier, but the first time we have acknowledged--by the \nranking member of the full committee and of this subcommittee, \nSenator Biden.\n    Senator Biden. I apologize, gentlemen. There is a defense \nbill on the floor and a lot of amendments, and I have been \ncalled in and out to come do my amendment and then not, so I \napologize for the delay.\n    I found the testimony interesting and informative and, as \nusual, Mr. Ambassador, I found your testimony to be first-rate. \nNot that the others were not, but you quite frankly have \ncaptured the nuances of the problem better than anybody.\n    I find it kind of fascinating, the little scenario, sir, \nyou just went through about if, in fact, we made it clear that \nthere was no independence in the future and there was going to \nbe some continued association with Serbia, that could \npotentially radicalize the population and Macedonia could cause \na problem.\n    Well, if all of that happens, one of the things I am \nconfident of from meeting with Mr. Thaci on several occasions, \nand being there on half-a-dozen occasions and talking, I think, \nto every player in the process over the last 8 years, including \neveryone in Kosovo the last 2 years, if any of that happens, I \njust want to go on record doing something no one should ever \ndo, making a prediction, and the prediction is, we are out, the \nEuropeans are out, Slobodan Milosevic owns it all.\n    The idea that Thaci and any successor, KLA, could possibly \nwithstand any movement by Serbia is nonexistent--nonexistent--\nand the possibility in the face of a withdrawal under the \ncircumstance I mentioned of NATO forces, of NATO going back in \nis nonexistent, and your formulas are, in my humble opinion, \nformulas for absolute disaster.\n    I think the only thing to focus on here is, how do you keep \nthis thing going as long as you can without things blowing up, \nand hoping the dynamic circumstance emerges that provides \nopportunities we do not even know exist now to take advantage \nof moving toward stability, and I have a few questions along \nthose lines, if I may.\n    The idea that we defer to allies, the implication being \nthat had we not we would have had a better outcome, I do not \nknow where you have been the last 5 years. If we had not \ndeferred to our allies in some of the things, there was no \npossibility this place would have given any--any--support for \nsending any Americans anywhere in the Balkans if the allies \nsaid, we are not in.\n    I find these exercises in what we should have done \nfascinating. I mean, we just beat back by, what, seven votes a \nproposal to set an end date to get out and conditions for our \nallies that reflect, in case you have not noticed, that close \nto half this place ain't sure about us even being there when no \none is being killed, and the absolute condition of being there \nis that the allies do more.\n    So we are going to stand down our allies, right. We are \ngoing to stand them down. Now we are going to get tough with \nthem and tell them we are going to do it our way, that is the \nimplication, because we have yielded to them.\n    I would like not to have to yield to them, but I would like \nto find 49-plus votes here on the floor if we did not on some \nof these things, which takes me to this question in point.\n    I think, Ambassador Abramowitz, if I understood the \nstatement correctly it is absolutely right. The way to do \nthis--and I would like you to respond--is to make it clear that \nthere will not be a return to any circumstance within Kosovo \nwhere Belgrade dictates outcomes in any way in Kosovo, and we \nhave opened the question as to whether or not there will be an \nincredibly loose federation, independence, or a process toward \nindependence.\n    I just got finished meeting with a number of Greek \nofficials. I promise you, Mr. Ambassador--you are more \ndiplomatic than I am--the prospect of us declaring that we are \nfor an independent Kosovo means goodbye Charlie. You know what \nis going to happen. They will cease and desist from their \nsupport. You will see the French follow them, and you will see \na vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate, because they will not \nbe coming forward with their commitments, for American troops \nto be out of there by June. I will bet my career on it. By next \nJune, troops will be out.\n    So it seems to me that one of the things we have got to \nfigure out is, what are the things we should not be doing, \nrather than what are the things we should be doing. One of the \nthings I want to raise is that we are about to vote on an \namendment by a Senator who I have great respect for, and who \nhas been the person who has most ardently disagreed with my \nviews on the Balkans for the past 8 years, and that is Senator \nKay Bailey Hutchison.\n    She has an amendment, and she has been consistent for 8 \nyears, and so it is not like this is anything new--and some \nthink this is a good idea. She has a sense of the Senate \nresolution calling for a Balkan stabilization conference that \ncontemplates a rewriting of the borders. She cites the Treaty \nof Vienna, or the Treaty of Berlin from 1878, and she cites \nLondon, 1913, et cetera, in all of which we wrote borders.\n    I will painfully point out that they are all disasters on \nthe floor, but they are the models that we are to use, and we \nwould invite all parties--I assume that includes Slobodan \nMilosevic--to this conference.\n    Now, my general question is, should we be at this moment \nmaking any substantial changes in our posture in Kosovo? Should \nwe be calling a major conference to get all the parties \ntogether? Should we be declaring that we are on the road to \nindependence?\n    I was very intrigued--and I agree with some of what Dr. \nWilliams said. I wish there were a way in which we could say, \nhere is the deal. We are going to further establish clearly \nKosovar institutions and support them in return for commitments \nthat you will engage in a rule of law that is even remotely \napproaching a rule of law, including acknowledging a \nmultiethnic society in your future, and we will see about \nindependence. We will see where this takes us.\n    But talk to me about whether or not we should be having any \nbig conference of any type now.\n    Ambassador Abramowitz. Well, Senator, you as always raise \nvery important considerations, practical as well as conceptual. \nI do not know of any conference in the Balkans that has made a \ncontribution, an international conference, and certainly not \nthe Congress of Berlin, and that is one of the sources of the \ncontinuing problems.\n    So the notion that we would get together a group of nations \nwith different views, particularly about where Serbia under \nSlobodan Milosevic fits in, seems to me a formula for further \nchaos, further disorder in the Balkans, and it is amazing, I \nthink, that this is being proposed in a serious way to resolve \nreally difficult problems.\n    Now, I do think, however, that--I guess I perhaps have been \nin the State Department too long, and tend to see some of the \ncomplexities more than I should. I do believe, however, that we \ncannot just drift. We cannot just accept the fact that it is \nvery politically difficult, which it is. The Russians, the \nChinese, a lot of the allies, that they have different views."
"smith","Senator Smith","smith","Senator Smith","    Ambassador, we cannot just drift. We cannot \nkeep seven votes here for who knows how long.\n    Ambassador Abramowitz. I am trying to answer the question \nof what do we do in the short term, and we can be swept along, \nso to speak and hope that something turns up. That usually \nturns out to be American policy. Let us wait until something \ngood turns up and then we do not have to face critical \ndifficulties with our allies, or the Russians, or the Chinese.\n    I sort of believe that the best thing is to start a process \nin which the people of Kosovo know that they are moving ahead \nand that the facts that will be represented by functioning \nKosovo institutions establishes a basic underpinning.\n    Senator Biden. Can you give me a specific example of an \ninstitution you have in mind?\n    Ambassador Abramowitz. The obvious institution is an \nassembly, a legislative assembly, because the place does not \nhave a constitution. We are now developing a constitution. I do \nnot know what degree of consultation with the Albanians is, but \nclearly, if you are going to develop an entity it has got to \nhave some rules. It does not have any rules now.\n    You have a half-hearted United Nations administration which \nprovides a certain amount of law and order but clearly does \nnothing to build an entity, so you have to start building an \nentity, it seems to me, or you are going to get ultimately \ndevelopments in Kosovo that are going to create an awful lot of \ntrouble and make it even worse on the Hill.\n    So I do not believe it is a prudent policy, whatever the \ninternational complexities are, and they are great, and the \ndomestic complexities, to sit still and hope for the best. My \nanswer is a very limited one under the circumstances, that the \nUnited States, for its own, should make it clear that while it \nis not precluding Kosovo independence, it is saying what will \nnot happen any more, that we will not stand by and we will not \naccept Serbian rule for Kosovo.\n    That to me is an important beginning, and I think it does \nnot create a major crisis in the alliance.\n    Senator Biden. I am of that view, Mr. Ambassador, and I \nwill cease because Senator Lugar has not had a chance to speak \nand I will ask you to refrain from answering the rest of my \nquestion until Senator Lugar is done. However, the last two \ntimes I was there, I asked all the parties I could meet, \nincluding former and present KLA people, about us just imposing \na constitution, just writing a constitution, just simply having \nthe United Nations go in there as a mandate and lay out a \nconstitution and set up those institutions now.\n    Everyone I spoke to said they would welcome the idea of \nthis being done by a committee, or this being done by \nconsultation, Albanian as well as Serb, because they cannot \nfigure out how to get from here to there.\n    Ambassador Abramowitz. Well, you are referring to an \nexisting problem, that the Albanians are divided. There is a \nlot of fractionating organizations there, fractionated \npolitics, and some people will say, post constitution. I am an \nAmerican. I have little problems about the constitution----\n    Senator Biden. When I say impose a constitution, I mean we \ndid not, quote, impose a constitution in Germany, and we did \nnot impose one in Japan, but we did--but that is another story.\n    I would yield the floor. Thank you."
"smith","Senator Smith","smith","Senator Smith","    Senator Lugar."
"lugar","Senator Lugar","smith","Senator Smith","    Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I \nappreciate each of the papers enormously. I thought they were \nbrilliant, and make a real contribution and have stimulated our \nconversation.\n    Picking up where Senator Biden left off, it seems to me \nthere is a case to be made for the United Nations, NATO, the \nUnited States, or somebody to formulate a constitutional \nsystem. We discussed today--and this is not a pejorative term--\nthat Kosovo is a ward of international security forces which \nfor the moment, depends on NATO or the U.N. mandate and is \nlikely to be the case for a long time.\n    In other words, this is a very special case which, for a \ngood reason, the rest of the world and us got involved with 2 \nmillion people, a million of whom were dispersed, and we \ndiscussed that. A million came back. How in the world can \npeople who are shifted around in 1 year, lose their lives and \nfamilies and fortunes, are redistributed back and expected to \nhave a deliberative assembly and then work all this out. It \nseems to me to stretch the imagination, but the failure to do \nso does not stretch imagination. It is chaos.\n    In any event, I think, and am stimulated by your testimony \ntoday, that I can conceive the international ward, where we \nprovide a constitution, and people begin to think and \ndeliberate on democracy.\n    Now, meanwhile, as you suggest Ambassador Abramowitz, it is \nclear, that since we have surrounded this in protective \ncoating, the Serbs are not going to get into it. We have the \narmed forces, and we would beat them, and we could stay there \nand demonstrate that. That would be true if there were \nAlbanians coming in, Greeks coming in, whoever wants to come \nin. This is going to be a sacrosanct place for 2 million people \ninvolved in learning how to build democratic institutions.\n    Your suggestion, and Dr. Williams' suggestion, is that \neventually there has to be integration not only of Kosovo but \nof a lot of places in southeastern Europe into European \ninstitutions, perhaps joining the European Union, maybe joining \nNATO in some form, but at least becoming involved and \nintegrated, but that may take some time, too.\n    As a matter of fact, even well-developed situations may \nhave to be discussed 10 years from now including European Union \nmembership. That was always the problem in discussing NATO \nexpansion. Ideally, some said, let the economics flow, and the \ninstitutions, and then you pick up the military, but that just \ndid not happen.\n    It seems to me if the United States is to be involved, we \nare going to have debates on the floor of the Congress, the \nrest would be a demonstrated American interest in this that is \nmore substantial.\n    Now, a part of this may be that we would say the Europeans \nare not moving fast enough, but we believe that we Americans \nwant to establish much more of a relationship with an expanding \nRomania, or Bulgaria, or with Greece, for that matter.\n    In other words, we accept the fact that they are in Europe, \nbut the world is very small. You know, why not have much more \nextensive bilateral relationships with the United States? Why \nnot allow or facilitate the United States to come in in a very \nbig economic way?\n    So you do have stability here, but at the pace the \nEuropeans are going at it, you will never make it. They will be \nquarrelling, warring, be back into it trying to separate the \npairs again.\n    This might get the European juices going and they would \nsay, this is an American invasion. We already think you are \ninvolved in hegemony and trying to do your own thing, and this \nsimply proves it, and we might just say, you are right. You are \nabsolutely right. That is what we are going to do, because you \nfolks again and again come to us and say, we cannot handle it. \nThat really is the basic reason for the American presence.\n    The Europeans say, we cannot handle it, so we say, we \naccept that, and you accept that, because we are coming. We are \nnot about to devote tens of billions of dollars to fight wars \nspasmodically, then have big debates whether we come in or out, \nor what the end game is.\n    The end game for us is a prosperous southeastern Europe. \nKosovo got us going. It may be a dubious enterprise. It may be \na good one, but nevertheless we are not a cut-and-run group. We \nare not going to undermine NATO. We are not going to undermine \nintegration. As a matter of fact, our policy is really to come \nin in a big way and to get it all straightened out.\n    Now, how does that strike you? In other words, as we had \nbeen talking today, we criticize the previous testimony as \nthere being no strategy, and you have talked about tactics, and \nthat is about, muddling through, hanging on, hoping for the \nbest. Maybe the seven-vote margin Senator Biden mentioned \ndisappears, and we all leave. Maybe Montenegro comes or goes, \nand no one really cares.\n    I am suggesting that if we do care, and I think we should, \nfor strategic reasons and security reasons of our own, there \nhas to be something for the American people and its elected \nrepresentatives to support, something to hang onto to say, this \nis us, this is our strategy. This is good for America.\n    Now, why do we not try to do that, Dr. Williams? Do you \nhave an idea about this?\n    Dr. Williams. Yes, Senator. I would agree with you and \nSenator Biden that the first step in a policy of intermediate \nsovereignty or earned independence is imposing a constitution.\n    Now, the important question is, which type of constitution? \nIn Bosnia we imposed a constitution on the Bosnian Government \nsimilar to the constitution of the former Yugoslavia, the only \none of its kind. It institutionalized ethnic division and \ncreated institutionalized political gridlock.\n    The alternative approach would be constitutions like \neverywhere else in western and central Europe and the U.S., \nmajority rule with minority rights protections.\n    One of the concerns we have about that first step of \nintermediate sovereignty is that we are working with the \nEuropean allies rather than leading our European allies to a \npolicy, and they are pursuing a similar approach to Dayton, \nwhich is institutionalized ethnic vetoes, rotating \npresidencies, rotating supreme court justices. We cannot \ndismiss the Europeans, but we need to demonstrate to them the \nbenefits of majority rule, minority right protections, and \nputting it in part of a larger package.\n    I think from afar one reason why some Senators are \nuncomfortable with our continued presence in the Balkans is the \nlack of a strategic policy. If we lead the European allies to a \npolicy, starting with the constitution, and not only imposing a \nconstitution but also imposing things that you could not impose \non a sovereign state--thou shalt not have a political or \nterritorial association with certain neighboring states--and \nthen things which are part of international law, respecting the \nterritorial integrity of neighbors.\n    Ambassador Abramowitz. Senator Lugar, I think you are \nasking some very fundamental questions, and the problem is that \nwe are trying to solve a very difficult problem in a short \nperiod of time, and it cannot be done that way, and our \ndomestic politics or domestic considerations prevent it from \nbeing done, or insisting that it be done in an impossibly short \ntime.\n    I do not know how to correct that, because for me there is \nno way, at least, that American troops can be withdrawn from \nKosovo for many years. Whatever we do in terms of enunciating a \nlong term goal, that happens to be the case.\n    I also believe that these countries are not going to create \nstability by regional associations. That is a wonderful thing \nto encourage. I do not think it will happen that way. If you \nare going to create stability, you have got to bring them into \na wider association of Serbs dealing with the Kosovars, and \nKosovars dealing with the Macedonians. You have got to give \nthem a wider goal.\n    That is why I always have said that if you were ever going \nto create stability in Yugoslavia, it is not going to be done \nby the--the Americans are necessary, but the long term has to \nbe to draw them in seriously, and I believe the Europeans--I \nprobably will regret ever saying this. I believe the Europeans \nincreasingly recognize that.\n    Now, whether they can get their act together, whether their \ninstitutions have enough flexibility to do that, I do not know, \nbut I believe that is one reason why we need troops there, so \nwe can bang on them and legitimately say, it is your \nresponsibility to do certain things, and we are going to keep \nreminding you of this, and we are making a contribution, \nbecause I believe that if we do take out U.S. forces, or we go \ndown to a platoon or company, or even a battalion, I believe \nthat I think it would send terrible security signals, but I \nbelieve it would undermine any serious long term effort.\n    How you get the U.S. Congress to accept that this is a long \nterm effort is beyond my capability, and I think one of the \nthings Mr. Milosevic quite frankly is looking at is the \nAmericans, if we get a new administration, are going to take a \nlong term view of Kosovo."
"lugar","Senator Lugar","lugar","Senator Lugar","    I think there has to be an economic \ndimension, not just a political one. In other words, that will \nnot make it on humanitarian grounds alone for strategic \nstability. There has to be a context in which there are jobs, \nand arguments in which grassroots America sees some value in \nsoutheastern Europe beyond what they see now.\n    Ambassador Abramowitz. I am sort of skeptical it can be \ndone economically.\n    Senator Biden. I agree. I wish, if we are going to have a \nRepublican President, that it would be you, and I mean that \nsincerely. Unfortunately, we have both been through that, and \nit did not work.\n    I probably just ruined his reputation by saying that. But \nall kidding aside, I think if a President, if someone came \nforward with a strong proposal saying what we were going to do, \nwhat the objective was, et cetera, we would have the ability to \ngo more than seven votes.\n    I would point out to everyone that we went through Bosnia, \ndeclared a failure, continued to be declared a failure, and we \nbeat back on three occasions an attempt to withdraw from \nBosnia. Now no one is trying to withdraw from Bosnia.\n    Bosnia clearly has a long way to go, a long way to go. But \nmy point is, I do not think it is as hard to sustain American \ncommitment down the road as we are making it sound when I talk \nabout the seven votes.\n    The general point I wanted to make is, it is close to \nimpossible to sustain it if the end result is an open fissure \nwithin NATO that results in any one of the NATO parties \nwithdrawing. That is the thing that will, I think, toll the \nbell here quickly.\n    We have more forces there, or as many forces there as last \nyear. You do not hear that, and even though all of us who know \nthe issue well can point to an incredible number of failures in \nBosnia and what has not been done, we have the support now, I \nbelieve, to sustain a continued effort to try to make it work. \nThat is the only general point I wanted to make.\n    And I did not want to mislead people by suggesting that I \nthought the support was so fragile that it would evaporate. It \nwill evaporate only if we end up in a shooting match with our \nEuropean allies that results in them withholding either troops \nor money or police or whatever. That will be the thing that I \nthink will change 14 votes.\n    I am not sure I am making my point clear, but I hope I am, \nand I think a more robust effort is not inconsistent with \ngetting American support."

"","","jr.","Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr.","    <bullet> First, I believe that the Balkans--Kosovo included--are \nnot a strategic sideshow as some have asserted. The region is vital to \nU.S. national security, since its destabilization would harm all of \nEurope."

"","","jr.","Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr.","    <bullet> Second, for that reason, we did the right thing in \nOperation Allied Force. In fact, I introduced the resolution \nauthorizing U.S. participation in a NATO air campaign, which passed the \nSenate. The House, as we know, failed to pass such an authorization.\n    In the middle of the war, I co-sponsored with Senator McCain a \nresolution, which was tabled, authorizing the President to use all \nnecessary force to achieve victory."

"","","jr.","Senator Joseph R.

"smith","Senator Smith","lugar","Senator Lugar","    Do any of you gentlemen want to make a \nclosing response to any of our comments or criticisms or \nquestions?\n    Mr. Bugajski. I just wanted to make a short statement in \nresponse to Senator Biden's comments. I do not think anybody is \nseriously suggesting the Albanians could defend Kosovo if NATO \nwithdraws. I think the message is, NATO is in there for a long \ntime, but the involvement will be more costly and more complex \nand potentially more damaging if we do not have a vision for \nthe Albanians as to their future status, and if in the interim \nwe do not seriously build the institutions which are not \ncompletely dependent on the international community. That is \nthe way I put it.\n    We are there for a long time, but it is going to be even \nmore complicated, more costly, if we do not engage in those two \nstrategies.\n    Senator Biden. I agree with you, as long as that vision is \nbrought along, or shared, or not completely at odds with the \nEuropean vision, with the NATO vision. That was my only point."
"smith","Senator Smith","smith","Senator Smith","    Dr. Williams.\n    Dr. Williams. I would just conclude, in agreement, that we \nwill likely have continued U.S. Government support for the \ntroops on the ground in Kosovo. However, we must understand why \nthey are there, and articulate their objectives.\n    Conditional independence and immediate sovereignty is an \noption, and it has been deliberately crafted in a way which is \nlong term, which is phased, and I think with substantial U.S. \nleadership we can bring the Europeans--who understandably make \npolicy through conferences, we can bring them into our vision \nof a stable Kosovo in a slow and incremental fashion."
"smith","Senator Smith","smith","Senator Smith","    Gentlemen, thank you. It has been very, very \nhelpful and insightful, and we appreciate hearing about the \nnuances of a very complicated situation.\n    So with that, this committee hearing is adjourned."
