"jeffords","Senator Jeffords","","","    The hearing will come to order.\n    I believe we have before us a very important task of \nreviewing legislation that will enhance the security at our \nNation's nuclear power plants and other civilian facilities \nthat utilize radioactive materials for commercial or research \npurposes. In his State of the Union address, President Bush \ninformed us that authorities had found, among other things, \ndiagrams of nuclear power plants in America in terrorist caves, \nalong with surveillance maps of American cities.\n    In February, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nresponding to an FBI report issued a warning of potential \nairline attacks against a U.S. nuclear power plant. Numerous \nmedia accounts had analyzed in detail the possibility of \ncreating dirty bombs from a combination of readily available \ncommercial sources of radiation and common explosives. We all \nknow that the credibility of these threats is inherently \ndifficult to pinpoint. But we all also know of the seriousness \nwith which these must be viewed and it has changed forever \nsince September 11.\n    These are sobering times. I commend the U.S. Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, whose chairman, Richard Meserve, is with \nus this morning, for the prompt and comprehensive efforts of \nthat Agency to address threats to our civilian nuclear \nfacilities. I have been briefed on the fact that they have \nplaced our Nation's commercial nuclear reactors on the highest \nstate of alert since September 11 and that they are conducting \na top to bottom review of their safeguards and security system. \nThis includes working closely with the intelligence community \nand others to coordinate all necessary programs.\n    They have also established a new office of nuclear security \nand incident response to consolidate certain NRC security \ndivisions. They have assured us that they are taking every \nprecaution to ensure safety at our nuclear facilities. I am \nalso aware, however, of a variety of criticisms and concerns \nthat have been leveled at safety procedures of our nuclear \nfacilities in the past. In spite of as much as a 6-months \nadvance notice, up to half our Nation's nuclear power plants \nhave performed below, that's below, the NRC's minimum security \nrequirements during NRC-sponsored mock terrorist activities.\n    Because of resource constraints, the NRC has since tested \nsecurity at each nuclear plant only once every 8 years. The \ncurrent design basic threat which set standards for actions \nfacilities must take to defend against attack has not been \nsignificantly revised in over 40 years and do not envision the \ntype of terrorist attack we now assume is possible following \nthe events of September 11. There are significant concerns both \nabout the design of the plants, the ability to defend against \ninside sabotage, and the location of spent fuel product.\n    Former employees have complained of inadequate training and \nbackground checks of security guards and other personnel. These \ninconsistencies must be reviewed and must be remedied. We must \ntake strong and focused action to ensure that terrorists \ncontinue to view our nuclear plants as undesirable targets that \nare strongly protected and difficult to damage. It is the duty \nof this Congress and this committee in particular to make sure \nthat there is effective coordination and cooperation between \nlicensees, the NRC, appropriate Federal agencies and State and \nlocal government, preventing criminal and terrorist access to \nour nuclear power plants and radioactive materials.\n    As the House and Senate, in cooperation with the \nAdministration, proceeds this week with intelligence hearings \non the events leading up to the September 11 attack, this need \nfor effective coordination among the various agencies \nresponsible for security is starkly highlighted. We have been \nwarned, we know these are possible targets. We know there have \nbeen problems in the past. We must allocate the resources to \nfully address these concerns.\n    A single successful attack would make it clear, in \nhindsight, that it would have been worth the effort. An \nunsuccessful attack will make it sure that we did the job well. \nIt is my intent to work with my colleagues on this committee \nand with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to quickly pass \nlegislation out of this committee that will ensure strong, \nconsistent and reliable standards for protection of our \ncivilian nuclear facilities. We cannot and will not allow the \nfear factor to hamper our committees.\n    It is necessary for the public to know that strong measures \nare in place to protect their homes and families against attack \nby those who hate us and our ways of life. As chairman of the \ncommittee, I intend to see such measures taken. I trust I will \nhave the full support of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and \nmy colleagues in this important matter.\n    Senator Smith."

"smith","Senator Smith","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Ensuring \nour power plant safety, our nuclear energy facility safety is \nof course of the utmost importance to this committee but also \nto all Americans. It especially hits close to home for those of \nus who have power plants in our States, as I do, and as many in \nthis committee do. It is vital that we as a committee be \ninformed and do all that we can to ensure that these assets are \nindeed safe, secure, and protected.\n    These facilities are, I might add, among the most protected \nstructures in the Nation. But it doesn't mean that there aren't \nadditional steps that can be taken to enhance that security. \nLast year, Senator inhofe and I introduced legislation together \nthat would accomplish that goal. We had provisions in the bill \nthat the NRC has requested for many years, provisions that the \nSenate passed in the last Congress by unanimous consent.\n    These are common sense enhancements and I have spoken \ndirectly about them to several members of the Commission, \nincluding the chairman. I know that Senator Reid also has \nlegislation and I'm hopeful that we can work together in a \nbipartisan way to reach agreement on that legislation.\n    But as we move this process forward, it's important that we \nwork with the security experts and resist efforts from those \nwho want ``added security'' as a means to further an anti-\nnuclear agenda. If that's where we go in this process, then we \nare going to fail in what we wish to accomplish. We have to do \nit the right way. I'm very anxious to hear from Chairman \nMeserve on what the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has been \ndoing to increase security and what plans exist to update the \ndesign basis threat.\n    But unfortunately this is not, with all due respect, Mr. \nChairman, the forum to do it. We're not going to be able to get \nall the information this committee deserves and needs to know \nin an open forum. I'm very much a strong advocate of the right \nto know and shining the light on our hearings and not keeping \ninformation from the media if we don't have to. But some of the \ninformation that we need to discuss today is classified as \nsafeguards and some is secret, all of which is on a need-to-\nknow basis, little of which is suitable for an open, televised \nhearing.\n    Mr. Chairman, as you know, myself and Senators Inhofe, \nVoinovich and Domenici requested that this at a minimum be a \nclosed hearing. On the Armed Services Committee, of which some \nof us are members here, frequently when we have situations like \nthis we have an open hearing, very briefly, and then go to a \nclosed hearing and get into the sensitive materials or \ninformation that we need to know as a committee. To the best of \nmy knowledge, no such followup hearing has been scheduled.\n    So in essence, our request for a closed hearing was denied \nor ignored. Now we're going to talk about nuclear security, \nabout all of our power plants, in front of the entire world on \nC-SPAN, including all those who may wish to do us harm. I find \nthis absolutely unbelievable that we're doing this. I would \njust say, as a caution to witnesses, if you don't feel \ncomfortable answering a question, in spite of the fact that you \nmight get chastised by a Senator, I wouldn't answer it. Because \nfrankly, aggravating a Senator as opposed to providing \ninformation that may let the terrorists find out what's going \non in our security of our nuclear power plants, frankly, that's \na fair exchange as far as I'm concerned. It's not going to \naggravate this one.\n    I would note also that the House Committee has held only \nclosed and classified hearings on this topic. The chairman \nmentioned in his opening remarks about what we found in the \ncaves of Al Qaeda. What do we want to be talking about that for \nin a public session? We almost slipped up, Senator Inhofe \ncaught it when he was doing his homework last night, a \npotentially damaging mistake, while reading through the \ntestimony, information that has been classified at the NRC as \nsafeguards that was included in some of the written testimony \ntoday. I'm not blaming the witnesses for that. The witnesses \nare trying to answer and be responsive.\n    But this is not the forum, in front of the cameras, all \nover the world, to do this. The Government has deemed it \nsensitive enough so as to strictly limit access to only those \nwho need to know. I'm talking about safeguards, I'm not talking \nabout necessarily classified or secret, as we call it in the \nformal sense. But there is a need-to-know basis, and I can tell \nyou that everybody watching C-SPAN today does not need to know \neverything that we need to talk about here this morning.\n    I understand that this information has leaked before. I've \nread it, I read it in USA Today. But that doesn't mean that we \nhave to further that and add to it and supplement it and give \nit credibility. That's not what we do. If something is \nclassified or listed as safeguards and it's in the newspaper, \nit doesn't mean we have to comment on it and make it worse. But \nit does underscore the point that these witnesses believe this \nis important information that we should have, but we just can't \nget it in this hearing.\n    This is a completely open forum, I repeat again, completely \nopen, national TV, world TV, let alone national, world TV \ncoverage. It's safe to assume that those who want to hurt us \nare going to be watching. Good morning to them.\n    If you have any thoughts that the information you're \nproviding could be of the slightest use to those who wish to do \nus harm, then please don't answer the question. In order to \nensure that the committee has the opportunity to get the \ninformation, I don't know why we can't commit to a separate, \nclosed and classified hearing prior to moving away, moving \ntoward any other comprehensive legislation. This will allow us \nto make the right decisions. It's vital for this committee to \nvigorously conduct oversight, and we can't do it this way.\n    Since 9/11, I've visited Seabrook, I've communicated with \nthe guards, I've met with the NRC chairman, I've met with the \ncommissioners, I've talked to those who provide the security at \nSeabrook. We held a press conference after it with one of the \nmembers of the NRC. We didn't talk about all the safeguards. We \ndidn't talk about what we do when somebody attacks the plant, \nif they attack the plant or how we might react to that or how \nmany people we have at the plant to protect us or what kind of \npeople they are or what weapons they have. We don't talk about \nany of that.\n    It's clear that these are things we need to talk about, \nfrankly, but not here. So frankly, Mr. Chairman, unless there's \na commitment made for me to the committee that we're going to \nhave a classified hearing or a closed hearing somewhere in the \nnear future as a follow-on to this, I will yield all of my \nquestions to anyone else who might like to ask them. Because I \nhave questions that I would like to ask in a closed forum.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."

"jeffords","Senator Jeffords","smith","Senator Smith","    It was an opportunity and no one showed \nup except me. But it's amazing what happens when you make a \npublic hearing and you have the TV cameras, and we almost get \neverybody. So just to point that out, we are not going to \nbreach any security, and we certainly feel if it's appropriate, \nwe will have one where the security aspects will apply.\n    But right now, this is also, looking at the large audience \nwe have, very obvious that the public has a great interest in \nknowing and has a great right to know what is going on. This \nhearing is to make sure that the public of the United States \nhas the background necessary for them to understand fully the \nproblems that we're facing.\n    Senator Reid."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Senator Reid. Mr. President, I only watch the highest class \ntelevision, I was watching Headline News this morning. There \nthey had a short piece on distributing to people in New York \niodine, some kind of potassium iodide, so that if there is a \nproblem in one of these nuclear facilities, they would have in \ntheir medicine cabinet these pills they could take to stop the \ndamage done by nuclear things floating through the air. So this \nis something the American people are really concerned about, as \nthey should be.\n    So I appreciate very much the concern of Senator Smith. But \nalso, we have concerns, the American people have, all over \nAmerica, people are concerned about another Three Mile Island, \nanother Chernobyl. We have a responsibility, this committee has \na responsibility, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Chairman \nMeserve has always been willing to come. I'm sure he dreads it \nthe night before, but that's the way it is. But he's always \nbeen willing to come and share whatever information he has, \neven though he knows that some answers he gives we don't like. \nBut he's been very candid with us, and I appreciate that.\n    The tragedy of September 11 has taught us many things. It \ntaught us the importance of first responders. It taught us the \nvulnerability of our Nation's buildings and the strength of our \nNation's resolve. Finally, it taught us that we must be \nprepared for today's threats, because they could become \ntomorrow's attacks.\n    Last year I introduced legislation with Senators Clinton, \nLieberman and Jeffords to improve the safety of our Nation's \nnuclear power plants. I appreciate the willingness of Senator \nJeffords, as chairman of this committee, to hold this hearing \nand take a look at this legislation. I also appreciate \nCongressman Markey, who has worked so hard on these issues. He \nhas done a tremendous job working to make our Nation's nuclear \npower plants as safe as they can be. As someone who has served \nwith this fine man, in the House of Representatives, I \nappreciate that his voice is heard in the Senate and all over \nthe country.\n    I'm disappointed, however, that the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission has not chosen to do what I believe is its job with \nthe same commitment to the safety of our Nation and the \nintegrity of our electric supply. When Senators Clinton, \nLieberman, Jeffords and I introduced our legislation, we \nintended to start a dialog, how we make our Nation's commercial \nnuclear power plants safer than they were before September 11. \nMany of you here today have strong views on that legislation. \nWe intend to listen to those before a final draft comes out of \nthis committee, of course, we all have to do that.\n    But when plants are failing nearly half of their security \nevaluations, we need to more than update the curriculum. We \nneed a new system, I believe. There are some plants that do a \nreasonably good job. But it's not to have peaks of success. We \nneed a high plateau that secures all plants.\n    Our bill also requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to \ntake a new look at the threats posed by terrorists. Our bill \nalso establishes a rigorous training and evaluation program for \nthe Nuclear Security Force. I must say, members of this \ncommittee and you, Mr. Chairman, we in Nevada have had some \nexperience. Nuclear devices were assembled there for some 50 \nyears. We had all kinds of concerns about the safety.\n    Chairman Dingle, when he was chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee in the House, established a very rigorous physical \nprogram for security personnel there, so that if somebody tried \nto breach this perimeter, which was very close to the outside \nworld, that somebody could run 50 yards and grab somebody, the \nphysical training of those people was very bad. It was \ndifficult, it was made harder to have people work there, but it \nwas really important in the long run.\n    So I think this is important, that we established a \ntraining program and an evaluation program for our nuclear \nsecurity force, one that is constant and persistent. A new \noffice will be established within the Regulatory Commission \nwith a dedicated team of mock terrorists whose only job is to \nperfect their skills in challenging the security guards. I see, \nMr. Chairman, when professional sports teams practice, they \ndon't do it against amateur athletes playing in the park. They \ntrain against other professionals. Nuclear security personnel \nshould do the same.\n    Our bill will honor the sacrifice of our Nation's emergency \nresponders by ensuring that emergency response plans are in \nplace and work as we expect them. Finally, we will require \nstockpiles of medicine to help in the event of a release of \nradioactive material from a nuclear facility. We have drafted a \ncomprehensive bill that will protect our Nation's nuclear \ninfrastructure. The American people have told us how they \nwanted their airlines and airports protected. We're doing our \nbest to follow what they want and what they need and what they \nshould have. We will work to make sure that questions about the \nsafety of our Nation's nuclear power plants are answered.\n    It's time that we give the American people these answers. \nToday I hope we will have a constructive dialog about the ways \nto make our nuclear power plants safer. More importantly, I \nhope today will be the springboard we need to pass legislation \nin the Senate that accomplishes this goal. I hope we can do \nthis, as Senator Smith has said, on a bipartisan basis. We all \nhave different ideas as to how we can do this. But we need to \ndo it, and we're all going to have to give a little and take a \nlittle to come up with a bill that will be good for the \ncountry.\n    Thank you."

"bond","Senator Bond","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for \nholding this very important hearing on security issues facing \nour Nation's nuclear power plants. Security at nuclear power \nplants is an important issue, I think, in communities in almost \nevery State in the Nation. My home State of Missouri has both a \ncommercial nuclear power plant and research reactors, including \none of the foremost nuclear medicine reactors in the Nation. My \nhome in Mexico, MO is less than 25 miles from the nuclear power \nplant in neighboring Calloway County.\n    We depend upon the power generated by nuclear power plants. \nNot only does it supply 20 percent of the country's power \nneeds, it does so with absolutely no air pollution. Frankly, \nI'd prefer to have a nuclear power plant in my back yard than a \nfossil fuel burning plant. France, in this instance, is way \nahead of us with 80 percent of its power generated by non-air \npolluting nuclear power.\n    As we consider ways to reduce air pollution in electric \npower generation, as we seek to deal with global warming, I \nbelieve we will only be serious when we change the rules so \nthat we can rely more heavily on nuclear power which will clean \nup our air and which will reduce the pollutants which lead to \nglobal warming.\n    Our role here in Washington should be to ensure that \nnuclear power is safe, to ensure that operators of nuclear \npower plants have all the tools they need to run safe and \nsecure facilities. But we must not make the situation worse \nwith one-size-fits-all or reactionary answers. We must not be \nsidetracked by those whose hidden agenda is to deprive us of \nthis environmentally clean source of energy.\n    Generally commercial nuclear power plants are probably the \nmost physically secure and least vulnerable of our Nation's \nindustrial infrastructure. They are robust, hardened facilities \nwith numerous redundant systems designed to assure public \nsafety. They are one of the most intensively and \ncomprehensively regulated industries in America. The Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission rules impose comprehensive security \nrequirements, including physical protection systems, armed \ntactical security forces and strict access control at all \nplants.\n    Is this enough? We need to hear if there are other things \nwe can do to make it even safer. I will certainly support \nthose.\n    Nuclear power plants are safe, however, by their own \ninherent design. Typical reactor containment walls are made of \nheavily reinforced concrete up to 6 feet thick. I urge all of \nyou, if you haven't seen it, to view the video tape of a \nGovernment test where they crashed an F-4 jet fighter into a \ncontainment wall at nearly 500 miles an hour. The jet was \nobliterated and the 6-foot wall was penetrated only by 2 \ninches.\n    Nuclear plants are also defended by robust tactical \nsecurity forces. These are not rent-a-cops moonlighting at the \nlocal mall, they are screened, trained professionals, many with \nmilitary or law enforcement experience. Current nuclear power \nsecurity forces are subject to FBI background checks, physical \nand psychological testing, screening and substance abuse \ntesting as part of the hiring process. They undergo rigorous \ntraining, including weapons training, proof of marksmanship, \nrecognition of sabotage devices and equipment and tactical \nresponse training. They are subject to continuous substance \nabuse and physical fitness checks. These are generally highly \nmotivated, well compensated professionals with a retention rate \nabove 90 percent.\n    Private nuclear plant screening forces stand in direct \ncontrast to airport baggage screeners, many of whom are simply \nwaiting to get a better paying job at the airport McDonald's. \nAirport security workers are untrained, unscreened, transitory, \npoorly supervised, poorly regulated and low paid. Unfortunately \nsome would like to apply a cookie cutter approach of \nfederalizing airport security to federalizing nuclear plant \nsecurity.\n    I think we're finding out now the problems in federalizing \nthe airport security, and I think that federalizing nuclear \npower plant security could lessen the security at those plants. \nIt could diminish and disrupt plant security. Effective plant \nsecurity requires close coordination between operators and \nsecurity forces. Creating a separate Federal chain of command \ncould inhibit reaction, coordination and communication when \nmost needed in the face of an attack.\n    It would require the NRC to hire some 5,000 additional \nsecurity employees. Many current security personnel would \nchoose not to be come Federal employees and new security \npersonnel would require years of on the job training. I think \nfederalizing nuclear plant security could also reduce the \nquality of security forces. Screening requirements for Federal \npersonnel in the proposed legislation are less stringent than \nthose already in place in the industry.\n    We do have and we should take the opportunity to see what \nreasonable steps we can take to improve security at nuclear \npower plants. I would like the provisions included in the \nlegislation referred to by Senator Smith, Senator Inhofe and we \ncan build on that, I believe. We can consider empowering \nsecurity forces by eliminating weapons restrictions and \nproviding limited arrest authority. We certainly should oversee \nthe NRC's review of nuclear plant security measures post the \nSeptember 11 attacks. I think the NRC testimony should be very \nhelpful.\n    In summary, I think the nuclear power industry has an \nunparalleled record of health and safety. They also meet \nunparalleled security requirements and must continue to do so. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues on this committee \non any measure that will improve their ability to ensure the \nhealth and safety of our communities.\n    Thank you."

In fact, my home \nin Mexico, Missouri is no more than 30 miles from the nuclear power \nplant in neighboring Callaway County.\n    Missouri, and the Nation, depend upon the power generated by \nnuclear power plants. Not only does nuclear energy supply 20 percent of \ncountry's power needs, it does so with absolutely no air pollution.\n    This Committee is considering ways to reduce air pollution from \nelectric power generation.

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Senator Corzine. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I very much \nappreciate your having this hearing and so do the people of New \nJersey. We have 4 of the 104 nuclear power plants and we're \nvery close to one in our neighbor in New Jersey which has major \nimpact if there were an attack or actually, if there were \nsafety problems. If anything September 11 taught us it was that \nwe need to be prepared. As you suggested in your opening \nremarks and others have noted broadly, there is evidence of \ninterest by the terrorists in nuclear power plants.\n    So I commend your leadership on leading this discussion. \nSenator Reid, Senator Inhofe and certainly Congressman Markey \nfor the leadership in trying to protect our people in a way \nthat is sensible but thorough, one that gives us confidence as \nwe go forward. The concern is real, as I think some of the \ntestimony and the data would show, unsatisfactory results with \na number of the mock attacks, personnel record problems and \nother issues that have occurred in some instances, not \nuniformly, but I think there is time, it is time for revision \nof our processes here.\n    I don't think you have to be anti-nuclear power to believe \nthat we ought to do everything that is necessary, belt and \nsuspenders, to provide the kind of security I think the \nAmerican public, I know the people in my State, are looking for \nand the rules are dated and need revision and I think that's \nwhat this hearing is about. So I think it's a positive and \nnecessary step to make sure that the public is secure.\n    I would be remiss, Mr. Chairman, if I didn't at this same \npoint, there are 104 of these nuclear power plants that \ncertainly are a concern to our Nation. There are 123 chemical \nfacilities where worst case release of toxic chemicals could \nthreaten more than 1 million people. I know that this issue \ndoesn't get as much headline attention, but I continue to be \nvery concerned, particularly in my home State, that this \nproblem, while not so headline oriented, is just as much of a \nrisk to our communities and the people who live there.\n    So I hope that we may be able to have similar attention, \nfrankly I think that we're organized much more securely, the \ndiscipline associated with the NRC and our State and local \ncommunities with regard to that protection is quite \nsubstantial. I think what we're doing in chemical plant \nsecurity in this country is one that we will feel that we have \nnot taken the proper steps if disaster were to strike. So I \nhope that we can have a similar hearing with a similar element \nof focus as we go forward here.\n    So I thank you and commend you for holding this hearing."

"inhofe","Senator Inhofe","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Let me first clear this record, because I heard the dialog \nbetween you and Senator Smith. Let me assure you, Mr. Chairman, \nwe have not had a closed, secure hearing. We haven't had one. \nWe had a members briefing, but that was held in the Johnson \nroom. You weren't the only one there, because I was there too. \nSo I think it's very important that we realize we have not had \none. This should have been one, but it wasn't one.\n    Now, Senator Smith's statement has dramatically shortened \nmine, because most of the things he was referring to and saying \nI would have. I don't have a nuclear plant in my State of \nOklahoma. But I am very much concerned, 20 percent of our \nreliability is on nuclear energy, I like Senator Bond believe \nit should be more than that. After having gone through all of \nour ambient air hearings and the pollution problems that we \nhave, this is one of the answers, it's cheap and clean energy.\n    Last Congress, I tried very hard to pass legislation which \nwould have increased the ability of the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission to protect nuclear power plants. Unfortunately, \nalthough we did get it passed through the Senate, in fact, it \npassed by unanimous consent, it did not become law. The NRC has \nagain come forward, asking for it, the legislation that I had. \nI have reintroduced it in this Congress. I hope that we would \npass my legislation this year.\n    In short, my legislation does three things. It prescribes \nguidelines for carrying firearms and the authority to make \narrests by nuclear power plant security professionals. Second, \nit authorizes the NRC to issue trespass regulations relating to \nthe introduction of dangerous weapons, explosives and other \ndangerous instruments or materials likely to produce \nsubstantial personal injury or damage. That currently is not a \nFederal crime. Third, it revises the crime of sabotage of \nFederal nuclear facilities so as to cover any production, \nutilization, waste storage treatment, disposal, uranium \nenrichment or nuclear fuel fabrication facilities.\n    I am keeping an open mind today and I want very much to \nhear the current state of security. I think that Congress \nunderstands the emotions surrounding the security of nuclear \npower plants. However, in order to make this hearing most \nproductive, I really would like to focus on the facts and with \nthose facts, I want to work with the majority whip and others \non this committee to draft legislation which would address any \ndeficiencies in nuclear power plant security.\n    No matter what we end up doing, I want to make sure that \nCongress works with and not against the current efforts that \nare being taken by the NRC and the Office of Homeland Security. \nFinally, I repeat, I think we should have held a closed hearing \ntoday. There is a problem with holding a public hearing on any \npossible security deficiencies at nuclear power plants, namely, \nterrorists can get hold of the very information which we are \nusing to protect the public in order to harm the public.\n    In that regard, I, along with others in this committee, \nexpressed our concerns in a letter to the chairman. I was \nshocked that even before the hearing started, some statements \ncontaining information which if correct is safeguards \ninformation, which if incorrect is false information used to \nstart fear in the public. This committee should not be \nproviding a forum for releasing safeguards information. So I \nwould urge our witnesses today to carefully craft their \nremarks, so as to be responsive to our questions but not \nhelpful to terrorists.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Senator Clinton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank you and \nSenator Smith for holding this important hearing. Certainly, I \nagree with the statements of both Senators Smith and Inhofe \nthat as we try to educate ourselves and more importantly, \neducate the public, we do so with full awareness of the \nsensitivity of some of this information.\n    I am also very pleased that Congressman Markey is here. I \nhope to have a chance to hear from him in just a few minutes. I \nalso want to thank Dr. Irwin Redlener, the president of the \nChildren's Hospital at Montefiore in the Bronx and president of \nthe Children's Health Fund for being with us today.\n    Both Dr. Redlener and I live in Westchester County. It's \none of the most beautiful places in the country, and it is also \na place where we have nuclear power plants. So unlike some on \nthe committee, I live about 15 or 20 minutes from one of our \n104 nuclear power plants. This is the principal subject that \nthe people I live near in my town and in neighboring \ncommunities talk to me about, every time, whether I'm going to \nthe store, stopping to get a cup of coffee or just taking a \nwalk in the neighborhood.\n    I think it's understandable. Because the unthinkable did \nhappen on September 11. Therefore, it is incumbent on us, as \nunfortunate an exercise as it may be, to think like our \nadversaries, to imagine the unimaginable and to work together \nwith the appropriate officials in our Government to be as sure \nas one can be in such human endeavors that we have thought \nevery unthinkable thought, we have taken every possible \npreventive measure. Because there is no guarantee in life of \nanything. But unless we've done all that we believe we should \ndo to protect ourselves, then I think we are going to be found \nnot to have fulfilled our responsibility.\n    Certainly in my specific situation, we have more people, \nabout 20 million in the Catchman area for Indian Point. It is \nin the most populated area of any nuclear power plant in our \ncountry. We have other nuclear power plants in much less \npopulated areas. I visited the nuclear power plants at Indian \nPoint and in Oswego. Certainly Oswego, which is in a much less \npopulated area, doesn't pose the high level of public concern \nor frankly, as inviting a target as Indian Point does. Nowhere \nin our country do we have the same concentration of population. \nClearly those who sought to inflict the most public, high \nvisibility damage on our Nation chose our most populated city.\n    It's a terrible thing to contemplate, but I think we have \nto. I don't see any alternative. Instead of being paralyzed by \nfear or being divided on different points of view or ideology, \nwe all have to work together. I think that's what this \ncommittee is attempting to do. We have to close whatever \nloopholes exist, legislatively or regulatorily, we have to \nstrengthen any weak links that we find, and we have to be \nunafraid to ask the hard questions. This is not pointing \nfingers or placing blame on anyone. We didn't have to think \nlike this before September 11. Now we have to. Therefore, it is \nimperative that we know what steps have been taken, are being \ntaken to protect our nuclear power plants.\n    According to news reports, not in a classified briefing, \nbut on the front pages of newspapers around America just last \nmonth, the NRC again put the Nation's nuclear power plants on a \nheightened state of alert because of information gained by our \nintelligence community. Well, you can imagine what that does to \nmothers and fathers in Westchester County and throughout \nAmerica who have particular concerns because of their proximity \nto our nuclear power plants. Now, since 9/11, the Federal \nGovernment, State and local governments, and nuclear power \nplant operators and owners have taken actions, and I applaud \nthose actions, to improve security. But we have the \nresponsibility to ask, has enough been done. This is what we \nare going to try to find out in part today.\n    The NRC has previously told this committee that it has the \nstatutory tools necessary to assure that any security \ndeficiencies are corrected in a timely fashion. Yet at the same \ntime, I know that the NRC is strongly supporting S. 1586, which \nI think has a lot of very good provisions in it.\n    As we sit here today, we know that the NRC still has not \nyet revised its rules regarding what kinds of threats nuclear \nplants must protect themselves against. The NRC has not \ncompleted vulnerability assessments on individual plants. \nMoreover, it is my understanding that the NRC still has not \ndetermined, or at least has not told us, either in a classified \nbriefing or in public, what the real threat posed by modern, \nfully loaded airliners cause to a reactor containment vessel. \nNow, that decision, of course, could drive a series of other \ndecisions about how to best safeguard these plants, such as \nwhether and when to impose no-fly zones, whether and when to \nhave Naval or Coast Guard support.\n    Now, we know that the NRC is working on these issues, and I \ndo appreciate everything that the Commission has been doing. \nBut I think it's important that we hear from other well \ninformed voices as we will at this hearing, in public, people \nwho have experience in the nuclear industry, who have expertise \nwith nuclear energy, so that we can make a judgment about \nwhether or not those tools in that tool box for security at our \nnuclear power plants are sufficient.\n    That's why I did join with Senators Reid, Jeffords and \nLieberman in introducing legislation to start a dialog, to \nbegin a discussion. I think that part of what we should be \nworking on in this committee is how we determine what of the \nmany additional steps that could be taken would appropriately \nbe taken by national legislation.\n    We need to guarantee seamless security and we need to do it \nas quickly as possible. Any legislation should ensure that new, \nhigher standards are met through revisions to the design basis \nthreat. We have to be more realistic about this. You can't give \nnotice ahead of time to the guards at these plants so they can \nput on their flak jackets, get their weapons out of the lockers \nin which they're kept, to look as though they're ready to take \non whatever possible attack may occur. This has to be a much \nmore well thought out and constant assessment of the security \nat each and every one of our facilities. Exercises have to be \nconducted regularly.\n    I believe, as someone who certainly lives within a rather \nimmediate proximity to a plant, that we've got to have more \nrealistic evacuation plans. If you come up to Indian Point, \nwhich is in a beautiful part of Westchester County, you'll be \non two lane roads for most of that trip. You're living in a \nhighly populated area. The idea that you could evacuate people, \nthe idea that people that are supposed to lead the evacuation \nwould even be able to get where they're needed strikes most of \nus as quite implausible.\n    Now, we are stockpiling potassium iodide in New York. The \nbill that I've worked on with Senator Reid and others requires \nthat stockpiling be required and that the pills be released to \nthe public on a regular basis.\n    Finally, I also think, because the NRC does have \njurisdiction, that in addition to exploring the security of \npower plants, we have to raise the issue of so-called dirty \nbombs. We have to know more and protect more against the use of \nradiological dispersal devices. That has to be on the agenda as \nwell as our concern about nuclear power plants, since the \nsources of such material are obviously accessible, easily so, \nin many parts of every community in our country.\n    So Mr. Chairman, I thank you for holding this hearing, and \nI look forward to working with you and all of our colleagues to \ncome up with answers to some of these questions."

"voinovich","Senator Voinovich","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    I agree that the topic of today's hearing is very \nimportant, so important that I believe our time could be best \nspent in a closed hearing in which the members of our committee \ncan discuss the security issues openly with the witnesses \nwithout fear of revealing information that could put those who \nwork in the facilities and the public at risk. I agree with the \nsentiments expressed by Senator Smith and Senator Inhofe.\n    Considering the importance of this topic, we need to hear \nall relevant information with regard to security, including \nfuture needs if we're to pass legislation that will enhance the \nsecurity of our nuclear energy infrastructure. I believe it's \nimpossible to get all the information we need to determine if \nlegislation is needed through public hearings.\n    Last August, I visited Davis Besse nuclear facility in Oak \nHarbor, OH for the purpose of reviewing the operation of the \nplant. I was extremely impressed with the security measures in \nplace to gain entrance and access to that facility.\n    Just this last April, I had the opportunity to spend a half \nday at the Perry Nuclear Power Plant in Perry, OH, which by the \nway is a 25 minute drive from my home, to specifically review \ntheir security systems. I wanted to see first-hand just what \nwas happening at that facility. In fact, the entire visit was \ndedicated to security.\n    I received a classified security briefing at the facility, \nwhich I highly recommend to all of my colleagues. In addition, \nI participated in personnel and vehicle searches, and I \nreviewed the external security systems, including meeting with \nthe Coast Guard which patrols Lake Erie off the coast of the \nPerry facility.\n    My tour of the security operations confirmed for me that \nevery security measure is being taken to protect our energy \nsupply from terrorist attack and the members of the surrounding \ncommunity and they should be very comfortable with the level of \nsecurity that protects them and the facility. If I were a \nterrorist, the last place I would try to take over and attack \nwould be a nuclear power plant. I know that security reviews \nare currently being conducted at nuclear facilities across the \ncountry, but I hope they are all as secure as our Ohio \nfacilities. I think it's important that we don't throw the baby \nout with the bath water trying to change things legislatively.\n    In my opinion, the private sector is getting the job done. \nWe do not have to federalize security, understanding that any \nsystem can be improved, and that's the responsibility of the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission, and there may be other things \nthat are being suggested by members of this committee that will \nenhance those security operations in our facilities because of \nthings that have happened because of 9/11.\n    Recently, I visited the EU headquarters at the Hague in \nBrussels. I was told and warned that the security there was the \nbest in the world. I tell you, I was impressed with the \nsecurity required to gain entrance to that facility. But it \ndidn't compare, it didn't compare with the security at Perry \nand Davis Nuclear. Because this is an opening hearing, and \nthough I think it would be helpful, I can't go into the detail \nabout how they determine who gets in, where they go, and how \nthey can get access. It's incredible.\n    I also visited the Lima Tank Plant in Ohio where they make \nthe M1A1 Abrams tank, and now that's another place that the \nFederal Government is securing. I met with people from the \nDefense Department that are involved in security. I reviewed \nwhat they were doing there. I said to them, if you really want \nto secure this place, get in a car and go up to Perry Nuclear \nand you'll find out how to really secure a facility. That's the \nway I felt about that, compared to what I saw at this Federal \nfacility that's something that we should be very concerned \nabout.\n    Before we move forward with any new requirements, I think \nit's imperative that the members of this committee spend some \ntime carefully reviewing the existing security controls at our \nNation's nuclear facilities. I believe that preparation for \neach and every committee member should be to include some \nclosed hearings, or at least one, and classified briefings as \nwell as site visits to the facilities in order to see the \nsecurity measures in practice. Get out there and get into these \nplaces and see what they're doing.\n    I look forward to working with my colleagues on this \nimportant issue and to the testimony from today's witnesses. \nMr. Chairman, I really hope that the legislation that has been \nintroduced in this hearing is really aimed at determining the \nsecurity at our facilities, and not an effort by those who are \nopposed to nuclear power to discredit nuclear power's \ncontribution to our Nation's energy needs. Nuclear power plays \na vital role in maintaining our energy independence and \nproviding a clean energy source.\n    I look forward to the witnesses' testimony. Thank you, Mr. \nChairman."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Senator Boxer. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n    I first want to address the point that this is not a \nhearing about the future of nuclear power. Of course it isn't. \nThat decision is made by the marketplace and the people who \nlive near the plants, and there hasn't been a new plant in 20 \nyears, and maybe there will be a change on that. People will \ndecide that in a democracy like ours. That's good.\n    For myself, I have no bias, except to say when the private \ninsurers are ready to insure these plants, that will give me \nmuch more confidence. Right now it's the taxpayers that have to \npick up the tab. So I think those are important points.\n    I also want to address the issue of closed hearings versus \nopen hearings. I just must say that the comments that have been \nreiterated by a few of my friends on the other side I find to \nbe disrespectful of our chairman. That's my own personal view. \nThat saddens me, because this is a man who really understands \nwhat belongs in a closed hearing. He had one, and all my \ncolleagues who said they want one never went. He knows what \nbelongs in an open hearing.\n    I would remind everyone that there were lots of closed \nbriefings before 9/11, and we had a disaster. So in and of \nitself, what's important is what we discuss. I want to send a \nsignal to the would-be terrorists in this country and cells \naround this country and wherever they are that we are doing \neverything we can to stop them. I think Senator Voinovich is \nright, there are some plants that are moving way ahead on this.\n    But there may be some problems. The reason I think an open \nhearing, Mr. Chairman, is so important--I commend you for your \nleadership and I commend Congressman Markey for his on the \nHouse side--is that we need to speak with one voice to those \nthat would harm our people and say, we're onto you, we're onto \nyou because the President of the United States, as you said, \nMr. Chairman, in his State of the Union address told us that \nnuclear power plants were a target. This isn't some secret. The \nPresident announced it.\n    We are here today with some of our colleagues who have \ndrawn up some good legislation here to say, ``You know, take it \nsomewhere else. Take it somewhere else.'' I would say for me in \nCalifornia, where we have four power plants, that this is a \nvery important issue. Now, the NRC views this as such a serious \nproblem, perhaps more serious than some of my colleagues, that \nthey've offered free potassium iodide pills. I have urged that \nthose be distributed to the people in my State. I have urged \nthat the National Guard be deployed to nuclear power plants, \njust to make sure that it's safe.\n    So Mr. Chairman, I would ask that the rest of my statement \nbe placed in the record. I want to commend you, and I feel that \nyour statement, I read it, is so balanced and so fair. You \npraise the NRC for steps they've taken. But frankly, I've been \naround here a long time, both on the House and Senate side. I \nknow it's hard to bring action to a bureaucracy. It's just the \nway it is. It's even hard to bring it to a big business. So \nwhen we put pressure on, that's a good thing. I think this \nhearing is a good thing, and I thank you very much."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Mr. Markey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much. I \nappreciate the opportunity to be able to testify before you.\n    I think at this stage we've already invoked the old Mo \nUdall axiom that everything has been said but not everyone has \nsaid it. So I begin with that as the premise for my testimony. \nI thank you, Mr. Chairman, and you, Senator Smith, for the \ninvitation to testify here today.\n    I have introduced on the House side the same legislation \nthat Senator Reid and yourself and Senator Clinton, Senator \nLieberman, Senator Boxer and Senator Corzine have introduced on \nthis side, dealing with security at our domestic, civilian \nnuclear power plants. Senator Boxer just dealt with the \nquestion of whether or not a discussion of this subject in some \nway or another deals with the future of nuclear power.\n    For the record, there has not been a new nuclear power \nplant ordered successfully in the United States since 1974, 28 \nyears ago. The reason that that is the case, as Senator Boxer \npointed out, is that Adam Smith, in his posthumous wisdom, has \ndecided that nuclear power plants cannot gain investment from \nWall Street Republican investment bankers. Instead, what they \nhave decided is to put 95 percent of their money into natural \ngas generated electrical generating facilities. That is not a \ndiscussion that has anything to do with the question of what is \nthe level of security around the 104 existing operating nuclear \npower plants.\n    Similarly, you have the question of the decommissioned \nplants, that is those plants that have already retired and what \nkind of security should be around those plants, pretty much in \nperpetuity. So these are not questions that we seek to put out \nin the public in the way that Al Qaeda could gain new \ninformation, because neither the chairman of the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission nor any of the witnesses are going to \nbetray any classified information.\n    But in the same way that the CIA and the FBI and their \nprocedures before September 11 must be examined, the public \ndemands that, so too must the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and \nits procedures be examined, so that the public knows that the \nchanges are going to be put in place. I think they understand \nand want some of that information to be classified. \nNonetheless, the discussions have to be conducted in a way that \nensures that security is enhanced.\n    Going back to 1991, I began writing to the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission about the potential of truck bomb attacks \nat civilian nuclear power plants. At the time, I was told not \nto be concerned about the issue. Only after Oklahoma City did \nthe Commission begin the process of upgrading.\n    However, even that upgrade does not deal with the level of \nthreat which is obvious in the aftermath of September 11. So \nlet me go down, if I could, a number of the issues which I \nthink we have to deal with. The reason, and Senator Clinton \nfocused upon this, the reason that we have to do so is that \nwe've learned from the caves of Afghanistan, on the computers \nwhich have been confiscated, in addition to the interviews \nwhich have been conducted with captured Al Qaeda members, that \nnuclear power plants, civilian nuclear power plants, are at the \nvery top of the list of targets that Al Qaeda would attack if \nthey could successfully do so. That's why we're here. Those are \nthe statements of Al Qaeda. So the 280 million Americans who \nsee these headlines have a right to know that changes have been \nmade.\n    So what are the issues? Well, we begin with something \ncalled the design basis threat. That is, what is the level of \nprotection which is built into the design of a nuclear power \nplant in terms of its security? Now, the bill which has been \nintroduced by Senate and House Members calls for the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission to begin a new rulemaking, a brand new \nrulemaking, to reexamine the design basis threat. That is, what \nkinds of threats could be posed against a nuclear power plant.\n    Up until September 11, power plants were only protected \nagainst several terrorists who would arrive in an SUV, who \nwould be relatively lightly armed, and who would be non-\nsuicidal. Now, that's all public. Since September 11, it's \nquite clear that they could arrive in numbers of 19 or more, be \ncoordinated in their attack, have advanced degrees, from \nEuropean or American universities, be suicidal, arrive with a \ntractor-trailer and have more insider help than perhaps we had \nthought previous to September 11.\n    So what the bill says is, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nshould go into a new rulemaking, a formal rulemaking to deal \nwith all of those issues. Nine months after September 11, the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission still has not gone into that \nformal rulemaking.\n    Now, we believe that the very fact that on a formal basis, \na Federal Agency dealing with the security of our country is \nforced to reexamine all these questions is a good thing and \nsomething which the American public wants. The Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission has not done that. We do not believe that \nthat is an unreasonable request of a Federal Agency dealing \nwith such a sensitive question.\n    Second, the question dealing with the level of security \nthat actually is at any one of these power plants, what is the \nmechanism by which we test its efficiency? Well, it's something \ncalled an operational safeguards response evaluation, that is, \nthese are mock tests, force on force tests which are given by \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission to determine whether or not \nany civilian power plant can withstand a test.\n    Now, before September 11, at that relatively low level of \nchallenge that would come from a terrorist group, that is now \nwe realize historically kind of an elementary school level \nsecurity exam, they were flunking at nearly a 50 percent rate \nnationally, nuclear power plants, before September 11. Now, we \nknow that post-September 11, that nuclear power plants have to \nbe protected against college level security exams. So what the \nbill does is call upon the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to \nupgrade, again, the testing, the force on force testing against \nthese nuclear power plants, to conduct it not just every 8 \nyears against each individual plant, but every 2 years, so that \nthere is an ongoing evaluation of the security around these \nplants.\n    Third, we call for the federalization of the force around \nthese plants, not an unreasonable thing. At airports across the \ncountry, the public, I think, feels a lot better that the \nFederal Government is now going to provide the security at \nfacilities which we know Al Qaeda has targeted, airports, as \nthey have nuclear power plants.\n    Unfortunately, right now at civilian nuclear power plants, \nsome of the guards are paid less than janitors, they are not \nequally trained, they are not equally equipped, they don't get \nthe same whistleblower protections that Federal employees \nwould, and as a result, it's not unreasonable to assume that \nthe level of security is not as high as it would be if we had \nfull time Federal employees who had that responsibility. So the \nNuclear Security Act, which we've introduced, calls for a \nfederalization of the guard forces at nuclear power plants.\n    Let's deal with the issue of National Guard. What should be \nthe role of National Guard at these facilities? In some States, \nNational Guard are deployed. In some States, National Guard are \nnot deployed. In some States, National Guard have weapons with \nbullets already in them, in some they don't. In some States, \nthey are authorized to shoot to kill, in other States they are \nnot.\n    Is it unreasonable for the American people to ask that we \nhave a uniform policy across the country that everyone can \nunderstand is present at their nuclear power plant? I do not \nbelieve that that is an unreasonable request. With regard to \nthe decommissioned reactors, that is, when a nuclear reactor \nhas completed its life, the reactor still remains there, as \ndoes all of the spent fuel in the facilities that will be \nstored there until at some point in the long distant future \nthere is a place somewhere in America that we could move all of \nthat spent fuel. But while we wait for that date to finally \narrive, we need some security around it.\n    So what happens at the decommissioned plants? Well, among \nother things, sometimes they are stored in areas that do not \nhave, clearly, the same security that that domed, reinforced \nfacility does around the reactor as it operates. The casks used \nto store the spent fuel are not tested to ensure that they can \nwithstand long, hot fire such as that fed by a full tank of a \ncommercial jet liner. There are fewer guards onsite at \ndecommissioned reactors, and security isn't tested using force \non force exercises. Let me say that again, security is not \ntested using force on force exercises.\n    So there you could create, as Senator Clinton pointed out, \nthe dirty bomb, using a large or small plane attacking those \nfacilities. It's a good question to ask. We know that on \nSeptember 11, the jets that were scrambled to protect the World \nTrade Center were in eastern Massachusetts. Was there enough \ntime given for them to arrive over that distance in order to \nshoot down what was at that point known to be a hijacked \nairliner?\n    So in other words, a lot of people think that the plane \nwould just be hijacked at an airport that was only 2 or 3 \nminutes away from the nuclear power plant. What if the plane \nwas hijacked 30 minutes away, and now it's clear that there is \nenough time to shoot it down, to have planes be scrambled or to \nhave anti-aircraft weapons on the ground? Is it unreasonable to \nask that there be some national policy which is established \nwhich has to be put in place on a coordinated basis?\n    I'll just mention two other issues. Senator Clinton \nmentioned one, which is the dirty bomb, which can be created \nfrom the lower level radioactive materials which are stolen or \nlost around the country. There have been 1,500 reports of those \nover the past 5 years, and 50 percent of the cases still remain \nunsolved.\n    There's also a question of foreign nationals employed at \nnuclear reactors. We require a security check dealing with \ntheir criminal background, but there is no requirement that \nthey pass any background check intended to identify terrorist \nlinks prior to their employment. So these kinds of issues all \nwould be dealt with if the NRC was forced to go into a formal \nrulemaking, rather than temporary upgrades that are made on an \nad hoc basis, but not on a permanent basis and not as part of a \nfull formal national set of hearings that would have to have \nbeen conducted, and where necessary, on a classified basis.\n    So I thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much for the opportunity \nof testifying before you, and I'd be glad to answer any \nquestions."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Dr. Meserve. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman and \nmembers of the committee, I am pleased to appear before you \nthis morning on behalf of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission.\n    My written testimony discusses the current status of \nactions that the NRC has taken in response to the terrorist \nattacks that occurred on September 11 and outlines some of the \nwork that lies ahead. I believe that the NRC's response to the \nattacks has been appropriate and thoughtful and that the NRC's \ncurrent programs continue to provide a very high level of \nsecurity. Let me briefly summarize my written testimony.\n    Before September 11, nuclear power plants were among the \nbest defended and most hardened facilities of the Nation's \ncritical infrastructure. In the aftermath of the attacks, \nsecurity has been enhanced even further. On September 11, the \nNRC advised our licensees to go to the highest level of \nsecurity, which they promptly did. Our licensees have remained \nat that level since that time.\n    Moreover, we have maintained a steady flow of information \nto our licensees through over 30 updates to our original threat \nadvisory. In light of the continuing threat condition, we have \nissued orders to our reactor licensees to establish the \nsecurity requirements within an established regulatory \nframework. We have continued over the months to work with the \nintelligence and law enforcement community, the Office of \nHomeland Security and others to ensure that adequate protection \nis maintained at our civilian nuclear facilities.\n    In short, we are comfortable with the security at our \nnuclear power plants. We are not aware of any significant, \ncredible threat that is directed at the power plants, although \nthere obviously are plants or facilities that are of concern. \nWe had strong security at these facilities before September 11, \nand that security has been significantly enhanced since that \ntime.\n    Moreover, the NRC is open to change. We are in the process \nof revising our design basis threat. We are reexamining how we \nshould reinvigorate the process of conducting exercises. We are \nexamining the processes by which people are cleared into the \nfacilities. All of this is part of the comprehensive review of \nsecurity that is under way at the NRC.\n    Many Members of Congress have asked the NRC how they can \nhelp to improve security at nuclear power plants and other \nfacilities. In response, the Commission has requested that \nCongress enact several specific legislative proposals that \nwould amend three sections of the Atomic Energy Act. Most of \nthese provisions are contained in S. 1586, which was introduced \nby Senators Inhofe and Smith at the end of last October. I \nshould note that all of our proposals have been coordinated \nwith the executive branch and enjoy strong support from the \nAdministration.\n    One of the proposals would provide Federal authorization \nfor guards to carry and use firearms at NRC regulated \nfacilities designated by the Commission, and to protect \nproperty of significance to the common defense and security \nlocated at or being transported to or from such facilities. \nThis amendment could provide some protection for licensee \nguards from State criminal prosecution for actions taken during \nthe performance of their official duties.\n    At the present time, State laws govern the use of weapons \nby guards at NRC licensed facilities. Some State laws do not \npermit guards to use weapons, except to protect against an \nimmediate threat to their own lives or the lives of others. In \nsuch States, it may not be possible to shield the guards at NRC \nlicensed facilities from State prosecution.\n    In addition, some State laws make it difficult for \nlicensees where there are security contractors to use more \neffective weaponry. To alleviate this problem, the Commission \nhas developed an additional provision not included in S. 1586, \nthat would authorize the guards to carry and use such weapons \nas the Commission may require. A copy of the original proposal \nwith additional language to address this concern is attached to \nmy written testimony.\n    Another provision would make it a Federal crime to bring \nunauthorized weapons and explosives into NRC licensed \nfacilities. Although the NRC may impose sanctions against \nlicensees for violations of its security regulations, there is \nno Federal law permitting the imposition of criminal sanctions \nagainst the person responsible for bringing the weapon or other \ndangerous instrument to the site.\n    Our final proposal would make Federal prohibitions on \nsabotage applicable to the operation and construction of \ncertain NRC licensed and certified facilities. We believe that \nthese legislative changes that I have described will contribute \nto enhancing the security of nuclear facilities and material.\n    The Commission opposes S. 1746, which would federalize the \nsecurity forces at commercial nuclear facilities. We see \nseveral fundamental difficulties with this legislation. First, \nthe bill separates the strategy for the security of nuclear \nfacilities from that of all other types of sensitive \nfacilities, such as chemical plants, refineries and dams. We \nbelieve society's defensive resources should be allocated in \naccordance with relative risk, and that the separation of \nnuclear facilities from all other types of sensitive facilities \nwill fragment the overall consideration of risk \ninappropriately.\n    Second, the requirement that the NRC establish a security \nforce for sensitive nuclear facilities addresses, in our view, \na non-existent problem. The private guard forces that exist \ntoday are qualified, trained and tightly regulated. Unlike the \nsituation at airports, there is no need to federalize security.\n    Third, the bill would bring about a fundamental shift in \nthe responsibility and mission of the NRC, and could have the \nunintended consequence of detracting from the Commission's \nfocus on protecting the public health and safety.\n    Fourth, NRC's role as an independent regulator would be \ncompromised by the bill's requirement that the NRC design \nsecurity plans for all sensitive nuclear facilities, to \nimplement the plans with NRC employees but then also to conduct \nevaluations of the efficacy of the plans.\n    Fifth, the bill would create command and control \ndifficulties because it would establish two classes of \nemployees, both of which would be responsible for safety in the \nevent of a terrorist attack licensee personnel responsible to \nthe licensee for safe operations and Federal employees \nresponsible to the NRC for security. In an emergency, these \nseparate lines of authority could lead to a diminution in the \ncapacity to ensure safety.\n    These fundamental difficulties in S. 1746 argue against its \nadoption. But there are also many other concerns raised by the \nbill which are detailed in my written testimony.\n    In closing, we look forward to working with the Congress, \nboth on the enactment of the NRC legislative proposals I have \ndiscussed, and on continuing to ensure adequate protection of \nthe public health and safety. I appreciate being here today to \ndiscuss the NRC's programs and am prepared to answer your \nquestions. Thank you."
"jeffords","Senator Jeffords","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Thank you for your excellent statement. \nAs I have stated, I commend you and the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission for the comprehensive top to bottom review of \nsecurity measures which you are undertaking. I know this is a \ncomplex process, and one that must be carefully considered.\n    However, we also must be diligent in quickly putting into \nplace appropriate measures to both provide protection and to \ngive the public the confidence that we are doing so. I have \nbeen told that the other agencies have set specific timeframes \nfor completing their Agency reviews, such as the National \nNuclear Security Agency within the Department of Energy, which \nhas committed its fiscal year 2003 budget request to establish \na new design basis threat for the security of the Nation's \nnuclear weapons facilities by September of this year.\n    Do you have a date certain for completion of your design \nbasis threat and other security revisions?\n    Dr. Meserve. We don't have a date certain by which to \ncomplete some of these tasks, although these are very much \nactivities that are fully engaging the Commission. Let me say \nthat we have established what we call interim compensatory \nmeasures at our facilities, which are significant enhancements \non the requirements that the licensees must meet in order to \nensure security. That gives us the comfort that we are in an \nappropriate position to deal with the situation today.\n    We're in a somewhat different situation than the Department \nof Energy in that it has the authority to make the changes \nwithout going through a regulatory process in doing so, and so \nDOE has a somewhat easier situation in bringing about changes \nin the security environment than the NRC.\n    But nonetheless, we have serious security that is in place \nand we are examining where we should go in the long term in \nterms of regulatory changes."
"jeffords","Senator Jeffords","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Well, it's important that you communicate \nwith us, if there's anything we can do to make sure that there \nare no roadblocks that are making it difficult for you to meet \nthese time demands.\n    Dr. Meserve. Thank you very much, sir."
"jeffords","Senator Jeffords","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    We want to help in every way we can to \nmake sure it can be done expeditiously.\n    When do you anticipate completion of the evaluation and can \nthis committee anticipate we will fully share in your findings?\n    Dr. Meserve. I'm sorry, explore what, sir?"
"jeffords","Senator Jeffords","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    The actions that you are taking now.\n    Dr. Meserve. Well, let me say, we are prepared at any time \nto share the actions that we are undertaking. Let me say that \nthey range over a wide variety of areas, and we're not holding \nup steps in one area to await actions we might take in the \nother.\n    As an example, Mr. Markey had raised the question about \ndealing with a possibility of foreign nationals who might be \nemployed at nuclear power plants. We have worked with the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service to complete the \nscreening of employees at nuclear plants to satisfy ourselves \nthat there are appropriate people employed at the plants. We \nhave revised the mechanisms for providing access, particularly \ntemporary access to the facilities, to upgrade the security. So \nthat's a step that we have taken. There are a multitude of \ndifferent areas in which we have taken steps as the \ncircumstances arise.\n    I can't commit to you exactly when the whole package of \nsteps will be completed. I see this as an ongoing effort that \nis going to consume the Commission. It may consume the Congress \nfor an extended period."
"jeffords","Senator Jeffords","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    I just want to make sure that we have a \nrelationship where you can freely come to us if you are having \nanything that is holding you up for which we can assist you.\n    Dr. Meserve. I very much appreciate that, sir. We would not \nhesitate to seek your assistance."
"jeffords","Senator Jeffords","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    It is my understanding in the past you \nhave conducted force on force training exercises against \nindividual facilities no more often than once every 8 years. Do \nyou intend to increase that, and what additional resources do \nyou anticipate for that, if you do?\n    Dr. Meserve. Well, let me say, I think that there has been \nsome confusion about the way exercises were conducted before \nSeptember 11. It is the case that on average, the operational \nsafeguards response evaluations, the OSREs, which is the \nterminology we use for the actual force-on-force drills, were \nconducted on average once every 8 years.\n    But that doesn't mean that the security at the plants \nwasn't subject to continuing scrutiny. We have resident \ninspectors that are at every site. There is evaluation that is \nundertaken at the sites as part of the ongoing inspection \nefforts to satisfy ourselves that the security requirements are \nbeing met.\n    The force-on-force drills are very hard tests. There have \nbeen some assertions made that we found problems at some of the \nsites at which these tests were undertaken. That's the case. \nBut it's what you'd expect, in that in conducting the tests, \nthe attacking force knew the entirety of the defensive scheme, \nand in fact the tests were designed to probe those areas where, \nbased on a full evaluation of the defensive scheme, our experts \nhad some questions about the adequacy of the defensive \nstrategy. So they probed exactly at the sensitivities.\n    I think it's very doubtful that a real attacking force \nwould have the level of knowledge to be able to design an \nattack in that way. Nonetheless, we are undertaking a \nreexamination of the entirety of the way in which we're doing \nexercises and there is a staff paper on the resumption process \nthat is expected to the Commission later this week. We will be \nstarting the tabletop process, I would anticipate, in the \nsummer, then go to the full force on force exercises and resume \nthem later this year. The Commission has not had the \nopportunity to examine the budgetary implications of increased \nfrequency. But I think it is very likely that the frequency of \nthe exercises will be significantly increased."
"jeffords","Senator Jeffords","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    What is your budget request for fiscal \nyear 2003 regarding additional security measures and how do you \nanticipate it will be used?\n    Dr. Meserve. We received a supplement for fiscal year 2002 \nof about $36 million. My recollection for fiscal year 2003 is \nthat it was on the order of $29 million or $30 million for our \nsecurity efforts. That would involve our continuing work on \nevaluation of vulner-\nabilities, enhancements of the communications capabilities and \nsecurity, and our own capacity to deal with confidential \ninformation and things of that nature.\n    I know you're accustomed to hearing about billions of \ndollars in the security area, and I think it's important to \nrecognize that we are a regulatory Agency, and the substantial \npart of the costs associated for security are borne by the \nlicensees and, of course, don't appear in our budget. Our \nlicensees have spent many millions of dollars since September \n11 dealing with the requirements that we have imposed."
"jeffords","Senator Jeffords","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Well, thank you. We have some additional \nquestions which we will submit to you for you and your staff to \nanswer. I now turn to Senator Corzine.\n    Senator Corzine. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the \ntestimony.\n    But I have some concerns about how your arguments flow with \nregard to S. 1746, particularly the federalization of security. \nQuite frankly, I have a hard time understanding how defensive \nresources that might be dedicated to preserving the safety of \nour nuclear power plants would undermine on a relative risk \nbasis other activities in our society. It just strikes me that \none has to assess the kinds of problems that could occur, you \nspeak about Indian Point, with 20 million people in the \nimmediate area.\n    I don't understand the flow of that logic with respect to \nchemical plants or other kinds of issues. It's either a \npriority and a serious risk to the public, which I think the \npublic believes it is, or it isn't. I don't think we're talking \nabout relative risk here, we're talking about a risk of \nsomething that generally is accepted as something that could be \nextraordinarily dangerous, both by identification by our \nenemies and also by our Nation itself.\n    Then I add to that your third argument that somehow or \nanother the unintended consequence of detracting from the \nmission of protecting public health and safety, nothing would \nbe more seriously detracting or contributing to public health \nand safety than a terrorist attack that tries to use our \ninfrastructure as a weapon. I'm not sure where I come out on \nthe federalization of security forces. But I don't see those \narguments holding any weight whatsoever in the context of a \nmajor issue with regard to public health and safety.\n    First of all, I'd like to hear your comments on that.\n    Dr. Meserve. Well, you've flagged a few of the arguments \nthat I presented. With regard to the comparative risk issue, \nI'm not suggesting that we should not take the risks of \nsecurity at nuclear plants seriously. What I am suggesting is \nthat we have a societal issue, in fact it's one that you raised \nin your opening statement, that we have other types of \nfacilities at which there are security issues. You mentioned \nthe chemical plants which could have consequences that are \nequally as severe as a nuclear plant if there were a successful \nattack.\n    Somehow or another, we need to develop a strategy for how \nwe defend critical infrastructure of all kinds. The argument is \nby focusing just on nuclear plants, we may greatly enhance the \nsecurity in one area, but we may be missing other areas of \nvulnerability. We need to have some sort of a comprehensive \nstrategy.\n    That's not the NRC's responsibility. Our responsibility is \nfor the nuclear plants. But I think as a society we have an \nissue of recognizing we have limited assets to be able to spend \non security, and somehow we need to allocate those in some \nrational way. It's a policy issue which I think is ultimately \none for the Congress.\n    With regard to the third point on the deflection----\n    Senator Corzine. You could agree with your presumption that \nthere are other assets in this society that need security, and \nmaybe are not even meeting the kinds of standards that we're \nnow meeting with regard to our nuclear power plants, and still \nargue that federalization is a good thing because it would \nprovide even enhanced security on those relative merits. I \ndon't know why that would dismiss it as an initiative.\n    Dr. Meserve. I think that's a fair comment. But I think it \ndoes lead you on the path, if you're federalizing security for \nnuclear plants, to look around the corner about the \nimplications of that and whether you want to do that for the \nentirety of civilian infrastructure. It does set you in a \ncertain mode of how you're going to deal with these problems, \nand it might be appropriate to think about how we deal with the \nintegrated set of issues, rather than just one sub-part of the \ntotal problem that we confront.\n    The third point which I raised was the possibility of the \ndeflection of the NRC. This is just to recognize the reality \nthat if we were to have responsibility for over 5,000 security \nguards and implementing security plans and ensuring their \nadequacy, and putting in the equipment that's necessary, we \nwould have an activity that would involve more than twice the \nnumber we currently have. We would become an Agency that would \nhave new and demanding responsibilities in the security that we \nhave not held in the past. I wouldn't want to suggest that we \nwouldn't succeed, but one of the things we'd have to fight \nagainst is that we could not devote the time and attention to \nthe ordinary safety issues that are the matters that we deal \nwith on a day-to-day basis.\n    Senator Corzine. It might come with some of the advantages \nthat Congressman Markey talked about, though, whistleblower \nprotection, greater consistency across the Nation, a number of \nother elements that I think are possible. Since the fundamental \nissue is protecting the public from the hazards, as you had \ntalked about, radiological hazards, I'm not sure that that \nisn't a stronger argument for federalization, to make sure that \nwe have a common approach to protecting security.\n    Let me ask one other question about spent fuel issues, \nwhich are certainly a topic of the day. The idea that there \naren't force-on-force tests with regard to commissioned plants, \nis that something that is one of the options that you are \nconsidering? Where are you with regard to that? Is that \nsimilarly, is there an intention to work on the dry cask \nstorage of spent fuel which, whether it's decommissioned or \nit's not decommissioned, in the current world seems to be one \nof the few options that we have that's available and certainly, \nwe've got a major controversy going on in the State of New \nJersey about Oyster Creek's storage of spent fuel in dry casks \nnext to one of our major thoroughfares being an issue. Would \nyou give us some comment on both decommissioned plants and \nprotection with regard to dry casks?\n    Dr. Meserve. I'd be glad to. Let me just note before I turn \nto that, however, that things like whistleblower protections \nare provided now. If there's an allegation of a problem at a \nnuclear plant, we provide protection to those people. It's a \nvery important channel for communication.\n    Senator Corzine. I'll just give anecdotal information. I \ndid, as Senator Voinovich, spent time touring one of the \nnuclear power plants and spent time with individual guards. \nThey did not--it was the only weakness that I actually saw in \nthis whole process--is that they did not feel that they were \nplugged into the structure of protection as securely as they \nmight in other ways. So I'm concerned about that.\n    Dr. Meserve. It is in fact the case that since September \n11, the concern about spent fuel and possible vulnerability of \nspent fuel has been something that has received a great deal of \nattention by the NRC. One of the consequences of that is that \nwe have significantly upgraded the security that is provided \nfor spent fuel, and that has been an ongoing process. There is \nsignificantly enhanced protection of spent fuel today as \ncompared to before September 11.\n    We have not worked out all the implications in terms of how \nthat would affect future exercises, but I would anticipate that \nfuture exercises will encompass a variety of aspects of the \nnuclear industry that were not so much the focus before, \nincluding spent fuel."
"jeffords","Senator Jeffords","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Senator Clinton.\n    Senator Clinton. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Meserve.\n    As I listened carefully to both your testimony and the \nanswers to questions, there were two statements you made that \ncaused me some concern. It's not a reflection on the NRC so \nmuch as it suggests some of the continuing challenge we face to \npreparing for whatever might happen.\n    The first is your reference in your written testimony and \nin response to Senator Corzine that we have to make hard \nchoices because we have limited resources for security. I think \nthat's the wrong way to go about this issue. We ought to figure \nout what is it we need, not only to secure nuclear power plants \nbut chemical plants and the rest of our critical infrastructure \nthat might be vulnerable to any kind of attack or even \naccident. We ought to say to ourselves, OK, that is the cost of \nsecurity in the 21st century.\n    Now, I understand that there are budgetary constraints that \nare imposed, but I certainly don't believe we should be \nlimiting ourselves before we even understand completely what \nour functional needs are and then put price tags on them. \nThat's not an NRC issue, that's a larger congressional issue. \nBut I believe it's imperative that we do an analysis that is as \nhonest and straightforward and as clear about the costs as we \npossibly can. Then it's up to the Congress and the American \npublic to decide whether they want to bear the costs. But I \ndon't think anyone in any Agency should be in any way \nconstrained about what is needed before we get to that final \npoint.\n    The second concern I had is in response to a question by \nChairman Jeffords. You were talking about the force-on-force \nexercises, and made the statement that it was doubtful that \nattackers would have such intimate knowledge of the nuclear \npower plants. I just think that's a false assumption. I don't \nthink that's an assumption we can make today. I don't believe \nany of us should be assuming any limited knowledge or capacity \non the part of our adversaries.\n    So I would reverse the presumption and start from a basis \nthat we have to presume that our adversaries know everything \nthere is to know, and therefore we have to take action to \nprotect ourselves against that presumption of knowledge.\n    Now, with respect to the design basis threat time line, \nwhich apparently has been pushed back, it's already been 9 \nmonths. Can you give us an estimate today as to how much longer \nit will take on the design basis threat re-evaluation? And \nthen, after the DBT is revised, how long will it be before we \nsee new security plans at plants? Will it be a matter of \nmonths? Will it be a matter of years? Can you give us some ball \npark estimate as to when whatever you eventually decide is the \nnew design basis threat will be implemented at plants across \nthe country?\n    Dr. Meserve. Let me respond, if I may, first to your \nconcerns, because I think there may have been some \nmisunderstanding of what I intended to say. My comment about \nthe need for allocation of resources was not that this has been \na constraint on how the NRC has examined the security issue. We \nhave looked at what we have thought has been necessary to \nprovide adequate protection of public safety and we have \nimposed those requirements without examination of the cost \nimplications of those actions.\n    My comment was really a broader societal one, and it was in \nthe context that Congress is going to have to decide about how \nmuch our society in the broad sense should spend on security as \na whole. It wasn't that I was purporting to make that as a \ndecision or a factor for the NRC to be making.\n    Second, my comment about force-on-force exercises may also \nhave been misunderstood. Our pre-September 11 DBT did include \nand does include inside assistance to the attackers. We \nconducted the exercises, therefore, assuming detailed knowledge \nof the details of the security plan. You and I may differ as to \nour sense of how likely it is that a terrorist attacking force \nwould have that knowledge. But we have assumed that knowledge \nexists, as it's obviously a conservative approach to be taken.\n    With regard to the design basis threat, this is something \nthat is subject to evaluation by the Commission now. I think \nthat we're talking about a period of months for us to chart a \nnew course. There are implications for the DBT in terms of how \nin fact we put it in place. There are some components of it \nthat obviously have to be classified, some components may \nrequire some regulatory changes. So there are some details that \ncertainly will have to be worked out. How exactly we proceed I \nthink is going to be guided by the deliberations that are \nunderway before the Commission now.\n    In the meantime, however, I think the most important point \nis that we have not waited all these months to make sure that \nwe have put in requirements at the plants to significantly \nincrease the security. We did that on a prescriptive basis, in \nthat we made demands for additional guards and additional \nweapons and additional patrols, as well as consideration of \nadditional modes of attack, with larger vehicle bombs, and \nthings of that nature. Those are all in place at nuclear power \nplants today.\n    Senator Clinton. Well, let me then just clarify, Mr. \nChairman, because in your written testimony, you state that \nrequests have been received by the NRC for extensions of the \ndeadline to submit a schedule for implementation of the new \norders that were issued back in February. How many such \nrequests for extensions of time were received by the NRC and \nhow many requests were granted?\n    Dr. Meserve. There may be some misunderstanding of the \ntestimony on that point. We have probably 30 requirements of \nthat order of magnitude that we imposed on the licensees. We \nasked them to come in within 20 days and give us the schedule \nfor completion of implementation and we set an absolute \ndeadline of August 31 for the completion of everything.\n    Some have come in and asked for an extension of the 20-day \nperiod within which they would give us the schedule for \ncompletion of all of the activities. The requests focused on \none particular measure that required some detailed analysis of \nblast effects in order to determine what engineering changes \nwould be needed. The licensees made the case that it was going \nto take them longer than 20 days to be able to complete that \nwork. We have not had a request from anyone to extend the \nabsolute outer limit of completing the work, which was August \n31. I apologize if there is some confusion in the statement.\n    Senator Clinton. Thank you."
"jeffords","Senator Jeffords","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Senator Boxer.\n    Senator Boxer. Thank you.\n    Mr. Chairman, I'm a little concerned about a few things \nhere. I just perhaps want to make a couple of statements and \nask a couple of questions. I am asking you, as one Senator who \nhas four nuclear power plants, please don't spend your time on \nthe issue of the broad question of how much we want to spend \nprotecting our people. That is a decision that will be made by \nthe President and by the Congress as we do our budget.\n    Your job is to tell us what you need to do to protect the \npeople from the disaster that would follow an attack on a \nnuclear power plant. I want to stress that. We need you to tell \nus that. I frankly don't need to hear that you don't think you \nshould federalize employees. You know, to me that is an issue \nthat I can go any way on. I just want to make sure the people \nwe hire aren't coming from the cells of Al Qaeda, whether they \njoin the Federal Government or they join a private security \nforce, OK?\n    So I am worried. Then I put that together with your point, \nwe need to look at all the threats, you said, don't just do \nsomething special for the nuclear industry, and you oppose this \nlegislation, which is your right, I respect that. But why don't \nyou want to be a model of safety? Listen to what happened in \nNew York as our colleague, Senator Clinton well knows. The \nWorld Trade Centers were designed for fire protection, but \naccording to the engineers, much of the fire protection \nmaterials were displaced after the plane hit the building.\n    Now, you have said in your testimony that nuclear power \nplants are designed to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes, fires, \nfloods and earthquake. As a result, the structures inherently \nafford a measure of protection against deliberate aircraft \nimpacts. I would suggest to you, in light of what we learned \nfrom the World Trade Center, that kind of rationale doesn't sit \nwell. Are you--I'm not going to ask this question because I \nthink I have to ask other questions in the closed briefing \nwhich I will attend. But I am just going to say then that I \ntrust that you are doing computer modeling to see whether the \nlessons that we learned after the World Trade Center would not \napply to this situation. So I'm not going to ask you a question \nhere. In fact, I'm just assuming you are doing this.\n    But I guess my point is then you say you don't know of any \nparticular threat against nuclear power plants, but yet you \nmade these pills available to the people, which I'm very \ngrateful you did that. So I hear mixed messages. I think the \nbest thing that we can do is to send a very clear message to \neveryone in the world that we are doing everything we can, as \nyou say, that we are acting conservatively. I agree with that. \nThat means you do more, not less.\n    You know, the President announced that the nuclear power \nplants were listed as targets. We've all seen the actual \ndocuments that came out of the search of the caves by our brave \nmen and women in uniform. So we know that.\n    So you're not suggesting that nuclear power plants are not \na target, are you, in saying you have no information? That's \none question. Second, are you briefed by the FBI and the CIA on \na regular basis? Do you feel comfortable with the type of \nbriefings that you are getting, given all the news that is \ncoming out?\n    Dr. Meserve. Let me respond to several points you've made. \nI think that we've gone off in a direction I had not intended. \nI was not suggesting that the NRC should make the judgment as \nto how much society should spend for security. That is clearly \nsomething for the Congress.\n    With regard to the aircraft, we are undertaking a very \nmajor effort to examine the engineering features associated \nwith aircraft vulnerability of nuclear plants. That is \nsomething on which I would be prepared to give you a briefing \nin a closed session. That has been a major activity for the NRC \nand our contractors in the period since September 11, to assess \nthe vulnerabilities and assess mitigation measures that should \nbe taken.\n    We have very close coordination with the FBI and the \nintelligence community and we have analysts who are intimately \nconnected with assisting those agencies in evaluating threat \ninformation. As part of our advisory system, when a licensee \nobserves something that is occurring at the plant, they report \nit to us, we coordinate with the FBI and the intelligence \ncommunity for its evaluation. There is a very close connection \ninvolving security experts at the NRC, working with their \ncounterparts in these other agencies, to assure that we have \ndetailed information that we share with each other. My comment \nthat they are not aware of a credible threat directed at a \nnuclear power plant is consistent with the information that we \nhave been receiving from the intelligence community.\n    I very much agree with your notion that the nuclear \nindustry should be a model for society in security. I think in \nfact we are. I would invite all of you to visit a nuclear plant \nand to see the level of security that exists at these \nfacilities. I think it would be very reassuring to you to visit \na plant and see on the ground all that is in place. I can't \nobviously describe it in this session, but I very much welcome \nhelping to assist you in a visit if that were necessary.\n    Senator Boxer. Mr. Chairman, I know my time is up, but I \njust want to make one point. I want to join with you and other \nmembers. We want to work with you for, you know, if there is a \ntime when you don't feel that you're getting the information, \nthese are the kinds of things we can help with. I wanted, and I \nwill in written questions, ask you about, I have 100,000 \npeople, far less than Senator Clinton, living within a 10-mile \nradius of my plants. But I have many, many more living within \n50 miles.\n    So I'm going to ask you to answer in writing if you will, \nwhat measures you're taking beyond the 10-mile rim. I thank you \nvery much."

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    I just want to say to the chairman, thank you for joining \nus today and for your stewardship and for your testimony.\n    In your testimony, your written testimony and also I think \nin part of your oral testimony, you talked about what we can do \nto help you and your colleagues to enhance the security of our \nnuclear facilities. You talked specifically about legislation \nintroduced by several of our colleagues which has been \nintroduced in this Congress which has not yet been acted on. In \nyour testimony, you discuss several of the provisions of that \nlegislation.\n    Can you just tell me, what is the status of that \nlegislation today with respect to having held hearings, \nscheduled markups? What is the status?\n    Dr. Meserve. The NRC legislative proposals on security, \npassed the Senate last year, but did not succeed in passage \nthrough the House. They were re-introduced here again by \nSenators Smith and Inhofe.\n    Senator Carper. Which Senator Smith?\n    Dr. Meserve. Pardon me?\n    Senator Carper. Which Senator Smith?\n    Dr. Meserve. Senator Smith from New Hampshire, who was with \nus earlier. We have suggested an additional provision to that \nlegislation, which has been described in our testimony. We have \nnot had an opportunity for a hearing in this session of the \nSenate to discuss this. So there has not yet been a markup on \nthat legislation.\n    Senator Carper. Is the committee jurisdiction for the bill \nthis committee?\n    Dr. Meserve. I will defer to you as to the jurisdiction of \nthe committees. But I believe that the jurisdiction is this \ncommittee.\n    Senator Carper. Mr. Chairman, is that correct?"
"jeffords","Senator Jeffords","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    I believe that's correct. We always claim \nit anyway."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","","","    [Laughter.]\n    Senator Carper. Let's talk about the legislation that has \nbeen assigned to this committee over which we have \njurisdiction. Take several pieces of it and talk with me about \nwhy they are necessary. Also what criticisms of those proposals \nthat you might be aware of, that we should be aware of. Don't \ngo into great detail, but just give me an overview, the key \npieces of the legislation, why they're critical and any \nopposition or criticism of those that you're mindful of.\n    Dr. Meserve. I think that I described in my testimony the \nNRC proposals and why we think that those are wise and how they \nwould be supplemented. So those are things that--they've also--\nwe have solicited and obtained the support of the executive \nbranch for those components of the legislation. So those would \nbe the three parts that were in Senator Smith's and Senator \nInhofe's bill as supplemented by the additional component, \nwhich is the attachment to my written testimony.\n    The other bill that is before this committee is the \nlegislation that would govern the federalization of the guard \nforces. My testimony discussed why we have concerns that we \nhave with regard to federalization.\n    There's one aspect of that argument that may require some \namplification. There is a command-and-control issue that we \ntake very seriously that would arise if the troops were \nfederalized at the commercial power stations. The reason is \nthat it is the obligation of the licensee to assure the safe \noperations of the facility. So all of the control room staff \nand so forth are licensee employees taking instructions from \nthe licensee within the regulatory environment that we \nestablish. But nonetheless, it's the licensee that has the \nfundamental obligation to assure safe operations.\n    The legislation would take security and rip that out of the \nresponsibility of the licensee and make that a Federal \nresponsibility. So that some of the employees at the site would \nwork for the NRC as our employees, responsible for security, \nand the people responsible for safe operations would report to \nthe licensee. You can imagine in an emergency, heaven forbid, \nif there was a terrorist attack at a facility that took out \nsome equipment, we would need clear command and control as to \nresponsibilities, and what actions needed to be taken. The \nlicensee actions to assure bringing the plant to a safe \ncondition are ones that would have to be coordinated with the \nsecurity actions. Fracturing the chains of command in those \ncircumstances, we think, would be a serious mistake. That \nshould be integrated. Having that responsibility integrated \ntogether in the licensee organization we think is appropriate.\n    Senator Carper. I want to go back to the legislation that \nyou mentioned at the outset, and that is the legislation co-\nsponsored in part by Senator Smith of New Hampshire. Part of my \nquestion was, what are the criticisms, maybe the legitimate \ncriticisms of the legislation, and how would you respond to \nthose criticisms?\n    Dr. Meserve. I must admit that it has been a complete \npuzzle to me in that the NRC for years has been pursuing this \nlegislation. It passed the Senate last year, and I have not \nheard any criticism of the legislation, but we don't seem to be \nable to get it done.\n    Senator Carper. Why do you think that is?\n    Dr. Meserve. I have no idea. I think that part of the \nconcern may be that it is not seen as dramatic enough. I don't \nknow. It seems to me that these are changes that are \nappropriate steps to take and they are ones that I would urge \nCongress to enact. I am not aware of any criticism of them.\n    Senator Carper. I would just say to my colleagues, we've \ntalked a lot, seen a lot about reports that came out of the \nFBI, and I guess it was in Minnesota and Phoenix and things \nthat we're mindful of and in retrospect we should have paid \nmore attention to. Someone should have done something as a \nresult of that. I would just hope here in this case that we not \nbe guilty of not pursuing an agenda once we've discussed it and \ndecided it's worth pursuing, that we not be negligent."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","           Nuclear Security--General Aviation is not a Threat\n (A Report by Nuclear Safety and Security Consultant Robert Jefferson)"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Summary: The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association commissioned \ninternationally recognized nuclear safety and security expert Robert M. \nJefferson to examine the potential threat from a general aviation \naircraft to a nuclear power facility. Jefferson concluded that even if \na general aviation aircraft were loaded with explosives, it ``would \nfail to produce the damage necessary to cause any radiological \ninvolvement of the public. Certainly, if a terrorist organization were \ninclined to undertake such an effort, a light aircraft would quickly be \ndismissed as a possible vehicle due to its impracticality.''\n    Specifically, Jefferson's study concluded that:\n    A general aviation aircraft could not penetrate the concrete \ncontainment vessel protecting the nuclear reactor. While many \ncontainment vessels were not specifically designed to withstand an \naircraft impact, all vessels are designed to withstand the impact of \ntornado-propelled ``missiles.'' Such missiles exceed the force of a GA \naircraft impact.\n    In one test, a 45,000-pound F4 fighter was propelled into simulated \ncontainment wall at over 450 miles per hour. The aircraft was \ndestroyed; the concrete wall was ``uncompromised.'' (An F4 is 18 times \nheavier than a Cessna 172, the most popular GA aircraft. Even in a \ndive, a Cessna 172 can't go much faster than 200 mph.)\n    Even a large commercial airliner such as a Boeing 757 would not \nlikely penetrate the outer containment vessel of a nuclear power plant. \nBut even if it did, the reactor vessel, which contains the nuclear \nfuel, would remain intact, according to Jefferson.\n    A general aviation aircraft loaded with explosives would not likely \ncause a release of radiation. Most GA aircraft have payloads of less \nthan 1,000 pounds. Any explosives would have to be carried in the \npassenger or cargo compartments. Even if a terrorist were able to rig a \ncontact fuse on the nose of the aircraft, the explosion would be \nseveral feet away from the reactor containment building. That distance \nwould reduce the damage to the point that even if the containment \nvessel were breached, there would be little or no damage to the reactor \nvessel inside.\n    An aircraft attack on auxiliary buildings would not likely cause a \nrelease of radiation. Nuclear power plants are designed so that a \n``single failure'' cannot cause the loss of critical safety systems. \nSupport systems are not co-located at a single point. An aircraft crash \ncould not destroy every safety and control system at once.\n    A GA aircraft could not ignite the Zirconium cladding on spent \nnuclear fuel. Spent nuclear fuel is stored in deep pools, covered with \nup to 50 feet of water. The pool walls are concrete and steel, The pool \nitself is a relatively small target. Even if the aircraft could hit the \npool, it would not likely disturb the spent fuel. To ignite the fuel \ncladding, the aircraft would first have to displace all the water, and \nthen create a fire that would burn for about 20 hours. That would take \nsome 176,000 gallons of aviation gasoline, The typical GA aircraft \ncarries 60 gallons of fuel.\n    Following the attacks of September 11th, the United States \ngovernment has struggled to identify potential threats and targets for \nfuture terrorist activities. Potential targets identified by security \nofficials have included shopping malls, banking institutions, water \nreservoirs, federal buildings, fairs, festivals, sporting events, and \nnuclear facilities. Some public officials have focused their attention \non the potential use of light, general aviation aircraft to launch \nattacks against national assets. Specifically, claims have been made \nconcerning the nation's nuclear power plants and their theoretical \nvulnerability to attacks from light aircraft.\n    As a result, the government and others continue to examine the \nissues surrounding both real and perceived weaknesses in nuclear \nsecurity. One such example of these efforts is the study initiated by \nU.S. Representative Edward J. Markey titled Security Gap: A Hard Look \nAt the Soft Spots in Our Civilian Nuclear Reactor Security. In this \n``study'', Representative Markey, who has historically proven to be an \nopponent of nuclear energy, attempts to establish a supposition that \ngeneral aviation poses a national threat based on its potential for use \nin strikes against nuclear power plants.\n    In reality, general aviation is a safe and important component of \nthe United States transportation system. Moreover, light, general \naviation aircraft do not pose a threat to domestic nuclear power plant \nsecurity, and the facts presented in this report explain and illustrate \nthis while refuting these accusations."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","                   NUCLEAR FACILITY DESIGN STANDARDS"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    It has been suggested that the design standards of nuclear power \nplants offer inadequate protection in resisting airborne attacks. One \npoint raised was the fact that few nuclear reactor facilities were \ndesigned specifically against threats from light, general aviation \naircraft. This point is misleading, because it overlooks the fact that \nby their very design, nuclear power plants are inherently resistant to \nsuch strikes. For example, in the late 70's, the Japanese government \nconducted a test in which a 45,000-pound F-4 Phantom jet was impacted \nat over 450 miles per hour into a concrete wall about the thickness of \nthe containment vessel of a nuclear power plant. The results were \ndramatic. While the aircraft was completely destroyed upon impact, the \nintegrity of the wall remained uncompromised. To relate this to general \naviation, it is important to note that the F-4 Phantom jet weighs 7 \ntimes as much as the average general aviation aircraft and was flown \ninto the wall at speeds exceeding two and one half times that of a \ngeneral aviation aircraft.\n    Parallels can also be drawn to one of the standard accident \nscenarios used in the design of nuclear power plants, the impact of \ntornado-propelled missiles such as power line poles. In a series of \ntests conducted by Sandia National Labs in the 1970s, wooden power \npoles were hurled into a concrete target (simulating a containment \nwall) at speeds up to 120 miles per hour. The power pole was, in each \ncase, reduced to splinters. However, the thick concrete targets were \nmerely polished at the point of impact. A power pole impacting \nperpendicular to the surface of the concrete is certainly as effective \nor a more effective missile than a light (aluminum), general aviation \naircraft.\n    These tests serve to support a statement made by Chairman Richard \nMeserve of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission in which he remarked, \n``Nuclear power plants are among the most formidable structures in \nexistence. Nuclear power plants are certainly far more capable to \nrespond to an aircraft attack than other civilian facilities.'' This is \nnot to imply that such structures are indestructible but that they are \nindeed very robust hard targets,\n    The Markey report implied that a general aviation aircraft impact \nto the containment structure of a nuclear reactor could cause a full-\nscale core meltdown. However, engineering data, supported by ``real-\nworld'' tests, refute these claims. The conclusions to be drawn are \nclear. Given that aircraft size and speed are two crucial elements in \nthe damage equation, a light, general aviation aircraft weighing less \nthan 6,000 pounds traveling at under 300 miles per hour simply lacks \nthe energy to cause significant damage. In comparison, a commercial \naircraft like the Boeing 757 weighs upwards of 250,000 pounds and \ntravels at speeds in excess of 500 miles per hour. Most experts agree \nin the event an aircraft similar in size to a Boeing 757 airliner were \nto strike a nuclear power plant, in all likelihood, it would be unable \nto penetrate the outer containment vessel. But, even if it did manage \nto do so, the reactor vessel, which contains the nuclear fuel, would \nremain intact, eliminating the threat of public exposure to radioactive \nmaterials.\n    Others have speculated a light aircraft laden with explosives might \nbe used to breach a reactor containment building, again implying this \nwould result in a full-scale core meltdown. Again, the capabilities of \nlight aircraft argue against such an attack being successful. Very few \ngeneral aviation aircraft have a payload as high as 1,000 pounds, even \nif flown by a small pilot and carrying minimum fuel. Further, the \nexplosives would be carried in the cabin placing them at a distance \nfrom the point of impact. Modem explosives must be detonated, and \nimpact has a small probability of causing detonation. So, even if the \nterrorist rigged a contact fuse on the nose of the airplane to set off \nthe explosives, there would be several feet between the reactor \nbuilding and the detonation. That distance would reduce the damage to \nthe point that, even should the containment building be breached, there \nwould be little damage inside (and no aircraft fuel to cause a fire). \nAgain, such an attack would be an exercise in futility as there would \nbe no radiation release and no public involvement.\n    Hypothetically, a larger aircraft (not the typical general aviation \naircraft) carrying thousands of pounds of explosives may be able to \npenetrate the outer containment vessel of a nuclear power plant, \ncausing severe damage to systems inside. However, this would affect an \nimmediate shutdown of the reactor, which would remain intact in such a \nscenario.\n    It has been asserted that, ``NRC recognizes aircraft crashes may \nresult in multiple-failure initiating events, and that non-safety \nsystem malfunctions could contribute to such events.'' The regulations \nfor analyzing the safety of nuclear power plants require every \nconceivable element that could contribute to safety degradation must be \nconsidered a ``safety system.'' Further, nuclear power plants must be \ndesigned to prevent ``single failures,'' no matter how they propagate, \nto cause loss of critical safety systems. It is inconceivable that the \ncrash of a general aviation aircraft could accomplish such broad safety \nproblems in a nuclear power plant.\n    Others have postulated that it would only take two hours after loss \nof ``on-site power'' at a nuclear facility for core damage to begin. \nThis assumes not only loss of on-site power but also loss of standby \npower and loss of emergency core cooling. Piling one miniscule \nprobability on top of another quickly stretches the limits of \nbelievability. These entities have also proposed that support systems \nand auxiliary buildings as also vulnerable to a successful attack. This \nassertion assumes that all support systems are co-located at a single \npoint, allowing an aircraft crash to destroy everything at once. This \nis a simplification that serves the alarmist argument, but it is simply \nuntrue."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Another possibility discussed regarding nuclear power plants \ninvolves the scenario of an aircraft crash somehow igniting the \nZirconium cladding on the nuclear fuel elements. Unlike Sodium, which \nbums on exposure to air, or Magnesium, which ignites at relatively low \ntemperature, solid Zirconium will not burn. Zirconium doesn't melt \nuntil approximately 3,330 degrees Fahrenheit. However, fine Zirconium \nshavings or dust will bum. In order to cause a Zirconium fire, it would \nbe necessary for a terrorist to fracture the nuclear fuel cladding into \nsmall pieces before subjecting it to a source of ignition. Even \nassuming that the Zirconium was fragmented into chips, the spent fuel \nelements are either under water (upwards to 50 feet in many cases) or \ncontained in massive shielding systems. This means that it would take \nan incredibly large quantity of heat to raise the temperature of the \nZirconium and the surrounding shielding to the point of ignition.\n    Moreover, since aviation gasoline burns at approximately 2,000 \ndegrees Fahrenheit, it would take an extended period of time to achieve \nthe temperatures needed to ignite Zirconium shavings. A fire that \npersists for a long time (twenty hours has been mentioned) requires a \nsubstantial fuel source. In an open configuration, such as might take \nplace on the ground surrounding a dry storage facility, gasoline will \nburn at a rate close to \\1/3\\ inch per minute (i.e., a large pan of \ngasoline burning will reduce the level of the fuel in the pan about \\1/\n3\\ inch per minute). Given that even the largest light aircraft carries \nless than 300 gallons of fuel, the possibility of such a condition is \npractically non-existent.\n    Further, to provide an optically opaque fire and transmit as much \nheat as possible, the flames have to be at least ten feet thick. Thus, \nto engulf a dry storage cask in flames (one model is about 10 feet in \ndiameter, others are larger) would require a pool at least 30 feet in \ndiameter. At \\1/3\\ inch a minute, this would consume almost 150 gallons \na minute even if there were no runoff. At that rate, a 20-hour fire \nwould consume 400 inches of fuel, or slightly over 176,000 gallons \n(equaling one million pounds). Not even the largest military tanker can \ntransport that much fuel. Using the figure of 20,000 gallons of fuel \nmentioned in the Markey report, a fire 30 feet in diameter would bum \nfor a maximum of about 2.3 hours. Since light general aviation aircraft \ncarry only a fraction of the cited fuel volume plus, considering \nrunoff, the resulting fire from a small airplane crash would be mere \nminutes. The possibility of a fuel explosion igniting the Zirconium is \nrefuted by carefully reviewing the dynamics of such an event. The \ntemperature of a fireball is again about 2,000 degrees, but the \nexposure lasts for only milliseconds. This would produce insufficient \nheat to raise the temperature of the Zirconium more than a degree or so \neven if directly exposed to the fireball.\n    It is hard to conceive that even a deliberate attempt to \ncontinuously provide additional combustible fuel to the fire over a \nprolonged time could ever ignite the Zirconium cladding on the reactor \nfuel elements. If the combustible fuel is to be delivered by an \naircraft impacting the facility, the crash will disburse the fire over \na wide area, and, thus, present absolutely no hazard to the spent fuel \nin either the fuel pool or the dry storage casks."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    One of the most unreasonable ideas presented to the public calls \nfor anti-aircraft capabilities around nuclear power plants.

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    General aviation aircraft would prove ineffective in an attack, \nsimilar to those carried out on September 11th. The World Trade Center \ntowers and the Pentagon were large, conspicuous landmarks and, as such, \nwere more easily targeted in an aerial attack than would be a nuclear \npower plant. The success of these attacks was predicated on the use of \nlarge, turbine-powered commercial aircraft with immense fuel carrying \ncapacity. A general aviation aircraft, at only a fraction of the \nweight, speed and fuel load, would be unable to inflict damage on the \nscale witnessed on that tragic day.\n    In spite of this fact, concerns have been raised regarding the \nperceived threat of general aviation to nuclear power plants. For \nexample, it was reported that 21 power plants lay within 5 miles of an \nairport, implying that these airports present an inherent threat based \non their proximity to nuclear power plants. Common sense would dictate \nthat proximity is hardly the issue in such cases. It is unlikely that a \nterrorist would rule out a given target based on the travel time \ninvolved in reaching it. The reality is that the proximity of these \npower facilities to active airfields does not increase their exposure \nto terrorist threats.\n    However, since the point has been raised, these airports (many of \nwhich are small general aviation facilities) serve as excellent \nexamples as to why general aviation is not a threat. The light aircraft \nflown into small general aviation airports throughout the United States \nare ill suited for terrorist use, given they lack the weight, speed, \nfuel and load carrying capacity to do significant damage to a target.\n    Of the 23 airports listed in the government study, 5 are so small \nthat they do not even appear in AOPA's Airport Directory, a \ncomprehensive compendium of civil airport data. Eleven of the airports \nare small private airstrips, most with turf (unpaved) runways. Five of \nthe airstrips have runways too short to permit operations by large, \nturbine-powered aircraft. In reality, only two of the airports listed \nin the report have runways large enough to allow operation by large, \ntransport-category aircraft. One of these is located proximate to the \nThree Mile Island facility in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which was \nspecifically designed to sustain an impact from a large aircraft. The \nMarkey report implies to a large degree that nuclear security concerns \nrest squarely with general aviation. However, scientific evidence to \nthe contrary demonstrates that the concerns raised have no basis in \nfact and are completely unwarranted."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Mr. Lochbaum. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the \ncommittee. My name is David Lochbaum. I have been the nuclear \nsafety engineer for the Union of Concerned Scientists since \nOctober 1996. Prior to joining UCS, I worked for over 17 years \nin the nuclear power industry.\n    The issue before you today is the security of our nuclear \nfacilities. As with many nuclear power issues, we have firmly \nstaked out middle ground on this one. We disagree with industry \nrepresentatives who contend that nuclear power plants are \nhardened structures, virtually immune from attack, and who \nclaim that the health consequences from a successful attack \nwould be insignificant.\n    But we also disagree with those who contend that nuclear \npower plants are an undue hazard that can only be dealt with by \nimmediately shutting them down. We view nuclear power plants as \nbeing vulnerable to sabotage and advocate taking all reasonable \nsteps to reduce the chances of a successful attack and to \nminimize the harm from a successful attack.\n    We are therefore pleased to support the legislation \nproposed in S. 1586 and S. 1746. Once enacted into law, these \nbills would provide millions of Americans with greater \nprotection against nuclear sabotage.\n    The Price Anderson Act proves the need for adequate \nsecurity. Price Anderson was created because the liability from \na nuclear plant accident could be so large as to prevent \nprivate insurance companies from underwriting that risk. \nCongress is in the process of renewing Price Anderson because \nnuclear power plants remain immense risks, hazards. The \nchemical industry and other industries do not receive \ncomparable Federal liability protection.\n    The 1975 fire at the Browns Ferry nuclear plant illustrates \ntheir vulnerability. A worker checking for air leaks with a \ncandle started a fire that burned out of control for nearly 7 \nhours. The blaze disabled all of the emergency core cooling \nsystems for Unit 1 and nearly all of these systems for Unit 2. \nOnly innovative efforts by workers to cobble together a \nmakeshift scheme for adding water to the Unit 1 reactor \nprevented a core meltdown.\n    It is not farfetched to think that one or more attackers \narmed with explosives or a large aircraft fully loaded with jet \nfuel might be able to cause more damage than one worker with \none candle. While all provisions of both bills have merit, the \nmost valuable portion of the proposed legislation is section \nfour of the Nuclear Security Act. This section requires the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission to conduct force on force testing \nat each nuclear facility at least once every 2 years. The force \non force tests pit mock intruders against the plant's barriers \nand defenders.\n    How do teachers evaluate their students' academic \nperformance? Do they use a checklist to verify that students \nattend classes and have textbooks, pencils, paper and \ncalculators? No. They use tests that demonstrate their \nstudents' capabilities. Textbooks and class attendance are the \npathway to knowledge, while tests are the best measure of \nprogress along that pathway.\n    Likewise, security checklists show that a nuclear power \nplant has gates, guards and guns. But they don't provide enough \ninsight on progress toward security.\n    Force on force tests demonstrate whether adequate security \nhas been achieved. Frequent demonstration of adequate security \nperformance is invaluable. The Nuclear Security Act also \nrequires potassium iodide stockpiling for people living within \n50 miles of each nuclear facility. This provision is urgently \nneeded to eliminate current inequities.\n    That potassium iodide has value is clearly demonstrated by \nthe fact that it would be distributed to nuclear plant workers \nand Federal, State and local officials responding to an \naccident. It would seem unwise not to provide equivalent \nprotection for Americans living downwind of the facilities. But \naccording to the NRC, only 13 States currently stockpile \npotassium iodine for people living within the emergency \nplanning zones. The NRC protecting only some Americans makes \nabout as much sense as the U.S. Coast Guard requiring lifeboats \nin only some cruise ships.\n    Expanding the potassium iodide inventory to cover a 50-mile \nradius, rather than a 10-mile radius, increases the likelihood \nthat all people in harm's way will be protected. No matter \nwhere the line is drawn, the question will remain about people \nliving at N plus 1 miles. The 50-mile radius seems to be a \nreasonable compromise. Even if conditions affect people 60 or \n70 miles downwind of a plant, potassium iodide upwind could be \nredirected to the folks that are in harm's way.\n    The proposed legislation would greatly improve nuclear \nfacility security. The only element potentially missing from \nthe proposed legislation is adequate protection against insider \nsabotage. There's language in the Nuclear Security Act touching \nupon insider sabotage, but it does not specifically address \nfactors such as the two-person rule for vital areas, use of in-\nplant security cameras, armed security guard escorts for \nvisitors to vital areas, integration of security considerations \ninto normal plant safety decisionmaking, and training for \noperators when responding to acts of sabotage.\n    UCS recommends the committee consider strengthening the \nproposed legislation by explicitly incorporating these items, \nobtaining a firm commitment for the NRC to include these items \nin their top to bottom review, or by providing clear guidance \non expectations regarding these items in the committee reports \nthat accompany these bills.\n    In closing, UCS supports S. 1586 and S. 1746 and hopes that \nboth bills become law. I have testified before Congress several \ntimes. Until now, it has been always to oppose this or to \ncomplain about that. It is a welcome change to appear today in \nfull support of these bills. The worst part about these bills \nis they address reasonable steps that could be taken but have \nnot yet been taken. The best part about these bills is that \nthey will solve problems once they're enacted. Thank you."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Mr. Skolds. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the \ncommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you \ntoday to discuss this important issue.\n    I would also like to thank several members of the committee \nfor investigating the issues of nuclear plant security first-\nhand. Senators Graham, Clinton, Corzine, Smith, Voinovich and \nSpecter have all toured nuclear power plants to receive \nbriefings on plant security since September 11, as have several \nmembers of the committee's staff members. In fact, Senator \nSpecter has toured three of the five nuclear power plants in \nPennsylvania, including two Exelon facilities.\n    I will focus my comments today on the legislative proposals \nbefore the committee, though my written statement provides \nextensive background on security at commercial nuclear plants \nin the United States after September 11 and recommendations \nthat the Federal Government should take to enhance security.\n    Before addressing the legislation pending before the \nSenate, however, I would like to make a few comments. We \nbelieve that there are people interested in doing harm to \nnuclear power plants. We have the most at risk, and we take \nthis issue very seriously. The nuclear power industry is \nabsolutely committed to ensuring that our plants are operated \nsafely and that all necessary steps are taken to protect the \nhealth and safety of the public and our employees. Thousands of \nour employees live within the 10-mile EPZ surrounding the \nnuclear plants and no one has a greater interest than we do.\n    Second, commercial nuclear power plants are the most well \nprotected industrial facilities in the United States today and \nin fact, many businesses are turning to us as a model for \nsecurity and emergency planning at their industrial complexes. \nThird, as the United States acts to strengthen homeland \nsecurity in light of the new threats to the Nation's security, \nit's imperative that Federal, State and local officials work \ncooperatively with nuclear plant operators to build on the \nsolid foundation of emergency response capabilities that \nexisted prior to September 11.\n    Let me turn my specific comments to the legislation. On S. \n1586, the nuclear industry is on record as supporting the \nprovisions included in S. 1586. While some NRC licensees have \nrecently expressed concern about the possible legal \nimplications of providing wide ranging arrest authority to \nprivate security forces, the industry stands ready to work with \nthe committee to resolve these concerns.\n    Concerning S. 1746, it makes sweeping changes in the manner \nin which security at commercial nuclear facilities is \naddressed. Unfortunately, this legislation puts the proverbial \ncart before the horse by mandating radical legislative \nsolutions to issues that have not been identified as problems.\n    Section 3 of the bill would substitute a statutorily \nmandated design basis threat for that developed by the NRC and \nwould federalize security at commercial nuclear power plants by \nestablishing a nuclear security force within the NRC and by \nrequiring the Commission to develop a security plan for each of \nthe Nation's sensitive nuclear facilities. Section 3 also \nlevies a tax on sensitive nuclear facilities to fund a newly \ncreated nuclear security fund.\n    Before legislating the details of a design basis threat, \nCongress should first direct the President to conduct a \ncomprehensive review with the various energy, intelligence and \nlaw enforcement agencies of the various threats facing nuclear \npower plants. Once such a review is completed, the NRC should \nbe directed to adjust the design basis threat accordingly.\n    With regard to federalization of nuclear security forces, \nExelon strongly opposes such a drastic and unjustified change \nin the security requirements. Security forces at nuclear power \nplants are highly trained professionals. Substituting Federal \nemployees to safeguard sensitive nuclear facilities may \nactually degrade security. We believe that the integrated \ncommand and control of plant security forces is an important \naspect of our operations, and plant operations personnel, and \nit's essential to ensure the protection of the public health \nand safety.\n    Similarly, requiring the NRC to develop the security plans \nfor each of the Nation's sensitive nuclear facilities within \n180 days would be a significant task that would result in an \nunnecessary and perhaps dangerous diversion of Commission \nresources. As with federalization of the nuclear plant security \nforces, requiring a federally developed security plan for \nseveral dozen sites is unnecessary given the lack of evidence \nthat the current system is deficient.\n    Finally, a tax on nuclear power plant operators would fund \na new and unnecessary Federal bureaucracy and would be \nunparalleled in the private sector. Simply put, this $700 \nmillion tax would fund an activity that is effectively managed \nby the private industry.\n    Section 4 establishes an operation safeguards and response \nunit at the NRC. The existing NRC operational safeguards and \nresponse evaluations, or OSRE, has been applied and interpreted \nin an inconsistent and at times arbitrary manner. Anti-nuclear \ngroups and the NRC have at times inaccurately characterized \nlicensee performance under the existing program by claiming \nthat we have failed.\n    Now, these programs have been conducted for approximately \n15 year. If the report had been that we had found no areas for \nimprovement, I'd be very concerned. There are areas for \nimprovement, and these exercises are very rigorous, these \nexercises are very detailed, and they're intended to identify \nareas for improvement.\nhave to sum up, you're at the end of your time.\n    Mr. Skolds. All right. I'll stop right there then. Thank \nyou for the opportunity.\n    Senator Clinton. Thank you very much.\n    Ms. Brian."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","  STATEMENT OF DANIELLE BRIAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, PROJECT ON \n                      GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Ms. Brian. The Project on Government Oversight, an \ninvestigative organization that works with insiders in order to \nimprove public policy, first began investigating nuclear \nsecurity by looking at the Department of Energy's nuclear \nweapons facilities. This work caused security guards at \ncommercial reactors, current and former NRC security officials \nand contractors with military experience to contact POGO about \ninadequate security at commercial nuclear plants.\n    My testimony is based on information and documents from \nthese insiders. I must strongly emphasize that our sources of \ninformation are not anti-nuclear. In fact, most of them have \nspent their entire professional lives working and supporting \nthe nuclear industry. We applaud the sponsors of Senate Bills \n1586 and 1746, the Nuclear Security Act, for several important \nprovisions contained in these bills.\n    The NRC's current DBT is wholly inadequate. According to \npublished sources, the NRC's DBT requires protection against \nfewer than a handful of outside attackers. This is absolutely \nabsurd, given the September 11 attack. I'd suggest that the \nfuss about disclosing the already very public number of \nattackers nuclear plants are currently planning to defend \nagainst appears more that the NRC and utilities are embarrassed \nabout this ridiculously low number.\n    Half the nuclear power plants cannot even protect against \nthese paltry current threat assumptions. Let me caution the \ncommittee, despite what Chairman Meserve said earlier, these \ntests are seriously dumbed down. They are not hard tests. They \nfirst do not go beyond this paltry threat assumption. I outline \nin my written testimony many of the other artificialities, \nincluding, as I think you, Senator, mentioned, that they give 6 \nto 10 months advanced warning, which obviously a terrorist \nwould not do.\n    Can the guard force protect the integrity of the plant from \na suicidal terrorist attack? The statistics say no. How much \nworse would those statistics be if the DBT accurately \nrepresented the threat we now face?\n    The NRC has never tested a power plant guard force's \nability to protect spent fuel pools, possibly the prime target \nof a terrorist attack. It is estimated that a terrorist could \npenetrate the fence line and breach a secured spent fuel pool \nin less than 60 seconds. We encourage the NRC to immediately \nrecognize spent fuel pools as a primary terrorist target.\n    Military special forces have told us about obvious \nvulnerabilities at most nuclear power plants that I would be \nvery happy to discuss with Senators or staff. I'm \nuncomfortable, however, outlining them in public testimony. In \nvery general terms, a terrorist carrying an explosive could \nblow a sizable hole in the reinforced concrete around a spent \nfuel pool. At one third of our reactors, the spent fuel pools \nare above ground, where they could be targeted from outside the \nfence line, resulting in the immediate release of high levels \nof radiation, quickly turning into an uncontrolled radioactive \nfire.\n    The Nuclear Security Act requires a plant to increase \nsecurity of these spent fuel pools. In the meantime, we \nrecommend barriers and delay mechanisms to supplement security \nuntil the spent fuel is placed in dry casks underground. Guards \nat one plant told POGO that their only firearms training was \nfiring 96 rounds or shots with their handguns, and far fewer \nwith their shotguns. Standard training requires only that they \ncan stand and hit a stationary target 25 years away. They have \nno training shooting on the run at a moving target.\n    Recently, some of the facilities, because of the more \nadvanced attention to this issue in the last few months, have \nintroduced a running man across the target, where the standing \nshooter is allowed to have 10 shots trying to hit the target. \nGuards have admitted that their training is so inadequate in \nthe face of a real terrorist attack, many would simply use \ntheir guns to protect themselves while they escaped.\n    Additionally, nuclear power plant guards are severely \noutgunned. Even the NRC's DBT assumes that attackers will be \narmed with automatic weapons and explosives. Yet many guards \nare equipped only with shotguns and revolvers. Contrary to the \nads in the Washington Post, placed by the nuclear industry \nlobbyist, NEI, guards do not normally wear flak jackets nor \ncarry semi-automatic weapons. At one-third of nuclear power \nplants, the guards only have access to shotguns that are locked \nup at a distant central location.\n    POGO strongly agrees with the Nuclear Security Act's \nprovision reviving the OSRE program and requiring that mock \nattacks occur no less than every 2 years. Chairman Meserve also \nmentioned that the NRC is in the process of revitalizing the \nOSRE process of testing facilities. I'd like to mention that \nthe NRC has twice closed that shop down because they didn't \nlike what they were finding out. I would not frankly trust the \nNRC without congressional involvement to make the decisions on \nhow they are going to revive that office.\n    Anti-terrorism experts tell us that the worst enemy of any \nguard force is the daily grind of nothing happening. A simple \nsolution is to add unannounced tests, which aren't happening \nright now by the NRC.\n    Senator Clinton. You'll have to wrap up.\n    Ms. Brian. Yes. POGO believes the goals achieved by \nfederalizing could instead be accomplished through the \nfollowing improvements. Security guards are among the lowest \ncompensated employees. I spoke with one last night who is \ngetting $2 less an hour than custodians at his facility. Guards \nmust be given whistleblower protections. Despite what the \nchairman said, only Federal employees have legal whistleblower \nprotection. Currently, utility and security subcontract \nemployees do not.\n    The Federal Government's expanded role should be to provide \nindependent oversight rather than managing security and we \nstrongly recommend taking the security oversight function out \nof the NRC. I'd also just like to conclude that we support S. \n1586 as it's intended to remedy some obvious failures in the \nability of guards to protect against attacks.\n    Senator Clinton. Thank you very much.\n    Ms. Hastie."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Ms. Hastie. Thank you, Senator Clinton.\n    I appreciate the opportunity to talk to you today about the \nstatus, the current status at commercial nuclear power plants \nin the United States. I'd like to make three points today.\n    First, commercial nuclear power plants have comprehensive, \nwell developed and regularly tested emergency preparedness \nprograms. The full scope of regulation pertaining to our \nnuclear emergency programs would cover a length of about 28.7 \nfeet. The bibliography alone for these plans is well over an \ninch thick. I've provided a description in my written testimony \nof the comprehensive programs.\n    Currently, there is strong inter-agency coordination among \nthe Federal, State and local agencies and with the utility to \ncarry out their specific response. I believe that many of these \nFederal agencies are under the oversight of this committee.\n    Nuclear power plants have to participate in an \nindependently reviewed, full scale exercise every 2 years. We \nhave conducted over 1,000 full scale exercises in the past 25 \nyears. We provide training to local workers through the \ncooperation of State agencies, and that includes firefighters, \npolice, medical personnel, ambulance personnel, school \npersonnel, school bus drivers and even local farmers. These \nintegrated training programs are an excellent way that we build \ntrusting relationships with the local communities that surround \nour power plants and also credibility with our State and \nFederal regulators and personnel.\n    Second point is that the emergency preparedness programs \nare founded on a strong scientific and technical basis. This \nincludes the two emergency planning zones around nuclear power \nplants. In 1976, a joint EPA and NRC task force developed a \nplanning basis for offsite emergency preparedness. The task \nforce performed a detailed analysis of the full range of \npossible reactor accidents to determine the appropriate \ndistances from the plant that should be used for planning \npurposes. The task force received substantial input from all \nFederal agencies and relevant State agencies that would be \nresponsible for implementing these protective actions.\n    Following a 2-year plus study, the task force concluded \nthat it was highly unlikely that prompt protective actions for \nthe public would need to be taken beyond the 10 miles. That \nstudy led to the 10-mile and the 50-mile emergency planning \nzones that are currently used today. We know our emergency \nresponse plans work. Because emergency response plans developed \nby nuclear plants have been used for many non-nuclear \nemergencies.\n    Evacuation of 10,000 people from Cedar Rapids, IA, \nfollowing a fire, used the Dwayne Arnold plant. There were \n17,000 residents in St. Charles Parish in Louisiana that were \nevacuated following a leak from a nearby chemical plant, using \nIntergy's water for a three nuclear power plant plan. We've had \nhurricanes, evacuations caused by a volcano at Mount St. \nHelen's. We've used Hurricane Andrew at Turkey Point. So we \nhave tested these plans many times in real events. We have \nnever had to use them for a nuclear plant evaluation.\n    Over the years, as new insights and experience regarding \nreactor safety have been analyzed, the 10- and 50-mile planning \nzones have continued to be found valid for our emergency \npreparedness programs. I am not aware of any new scientific or \ntechnical information, even post-9/11, that would support \nfundamental changes to the existing 10- and 50-mile planning \nzones.\n    My third point is brief. Continual learning is an integral \npart of each of our emergency preparedness programs. We have a \ncommitment to excellence throughout the industry, coupled with \ncontinued training, self-assessment and testing that has \nproduced a high level of preparedness.\n    In summary, in the past 30 years, the nuclear industry has \nconducted, as I said, over 1,000 full scale graded exercises. \nWe have evidence that our emergency preparedness programs are \neffective. We continue to strive for new levels of safety.\n    I thank you for the opportunity today to provide testimony \nat this hearing. I am sure that everyone here shares a common \ngoal, and that is to protect the health and safety of the \npublic. That's the commitment that binds us all. Thank you.\n    Senator Clinton. Thank you very much, Ms. Hastie.\n    Dr. Redlener."

I'm also pleased to be here, and I'm anxious to be \nsupportive of the Nuclear Security Act and so glad that it has \nbeen proposed.\n    As a pediatrician, and as a public health expert who's been \ninvolved in public health for 30 years, I have been increasinly \ninvolved locally in New York and nationally in a variety of \nefforts with respect to the public health and general \npreparedness planning for ongoing terrorism. Specifically, \namong my most important concerns now has been the growing \nawareness of potential terrorist attacks on nuclear power \nfacilities. Clearly, the events of September 11 demand a \nreexamination of all aspects of the vulnerability and security \nof these facilities. The fact is that because of the potential \nhuman consequences of a successful attack on power plants, this \nissue represents one of the most important public health \nchallenges of our time.\n    Here in a nutshell is what we know about the public health \nand health risks of nuclear attacks. Depending on the specifics \nof the projected attack scenarios and the extent of damage to a \nreactor, its support systems and/or the spent fuel containment \nsystems, immediate civilian fatalities can range from 100 or so \nto 5,000 or more plus long term excess cancers from radiation \nexposure ranging at least into the tens of thousands. Moreover, \nnuclear terrorism is in a special category of psychological \nhorror, even different from chemical and other kinds of violent \nterrorist attacks, because nuclear terrorism is evocative of \nnightmare scenarios that we've lived with for decades.\n    In addition to the human toll studies, which have been done \nby many independent experts, other experts have also concluded \nthat thousands of square miles could be contaminated and \nuninhabitable for years or decades under a variety of possible \nnuclear plant attack scenarios. In sum, the economic, \npsychological and societal consequences of such an event in a \nmajor population center would be almost incalculable.\n    For all of these reasons, it's imperative that we take \nnecessary and prudent steps, as we would with any other kind of \nmajor public health threat, to reduce the likelihood of a \nsuccessful act of terrorism against a nuclear power plant.\n    There are some steps that I believe can help us assure the \npublic that we're dealing with this challenge preventively and \neffectively. Much of this is addressed in the legislation at \nhand. First and foremost, I believe strongly that the security \nat nuclear plants needs to be upgraded dramatically and \nimmediately. Importantly, the upgrade of plant security needs \nto be commensurate with our new and totally different \nunderstanding of the capacity, ferocity and intelligence of \nterrorism as we've seen it on American soil. As a public health \nprofessional, having some understanding of what the public \nneeds, practically and psychologically, I believe that \nfederalizing the security forces at nuclear power plants is an \nurgent priority.\n    Second, all spent fuel rods should be stored in hardened, \nonsite dry storage facilities pending more definitive solutions \nto the challenge of permanent storage. Unlike the reactor core \nitself, which is in a hardened containment structure, the spent \nfuel in many plants, for example, the Indian Point plant that \nSenator Clinton referred to, is in an adjacent, comparatively \nlightweight structure covered with nothing more than a \ncorrugated steel roof. A significant terrorist-induced \nexplosion and fire could potentially release massive doses of \nradioactive material into the atmosphere. Dry storage can \nreduce this risk dramatically.\n    Third, there needs to be a top to bottom revision and \nupgrading of the emergency planning process with active Federal \noversight. Planning for evacuation, especially in densely \npopulated areas, is extremely difficult under any circumstance. \nThe grossly inadequate emergency evacuation planning process \naround the Indian Point facility is a case study. The planning \nzone of 10 miles is entirely too limited and is inconsistent \nwith potential expectations of damage, contamination and human \nbehavior under crisis conditions.\n    In fact, spontaneous, uncontrolled evacuations in a time of \ncrisis, well beyond the 10-mile zone, could quickly result in \nchaos and paralysis of egress for people. Permanent relocation \nfor evacuees in the event of substantial ground contamination \nwould be an extraordinary challenge. Furthermore, children in \nschool and day care would need to be reunited with their \nparents. Hospitalized patients, senior citizens, disabled \npersons, prisoners, persons refusing to leave the area, all \nrepresent some of the vexing real world challenges not met by \nthe current evacuation plans.\n    Finally, potassium iodide should be acquired and \ndistributed on a point of use basis for a minimum of 50 miles \nfrom all the nuclear power plants.\n    There is, of course, much more to talk about. I'm obviously \navailable for whatever questions you might have.\n    Senator Clinton. Well, I want to thank all of the \nwitnesses. I know that other members could not stay, obviously \nthe hearing went on longer than anticipated. But I think on \nbehalf of every one of our members on this committee, I greatly \nappreciate your expertise, your testimony and the different \nperspectives that you have brought to bear on the issues \nconfronting us.\n    I think it would be very helpful for us to be able to \nsubmit questions to you for the record. I also would invite \nperhaps questions from the witnesses for other witnesses or for \nongoing discussion. Because as one listened to this panel, you \ncan see there is a very different perspective that I think is \nlegitimately held in good faith. But it is our job to try to \nsort it out, to figure out exactly where we need to take action \nand encourage whatever steps are necessary to maximize the \nsecurity of our nuclear power plants.\n    So I thank you very much for your testimony today. I look \nforward to the questions being answered that I know I will be \nsubmitting to each of you. I wish that you would be, all of \nyou, on call for further consultation by members and staff, \nbecause this is an extremely important issue. I don't think we \ncan take anything for granted, no matter what worked in the \npast, I don't think we can take it for granted now and into the \nfuture.\n    We need the extraordinary commitment that each of you \nbrings to this issue to help us sort out what we should be \ndoing in the future. Again, I thank you and I thank all of the \naudience, who's been very patient. I've seen heads nodding, \ndepending on which perspective you agree with. But I think for \nall of us, we need to put aside preexisting attitudes, beliefs, \nexperience, and take a new look at this, no matter what \nperspective we came into the hearing with today.\n    With that, the committee is adjourned."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","        Statement of Richard A. Meserve, Chairman, U.S. Nuclear \n                         Regulatory Commission"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I am pleased to appear \nbefore you on behalf of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission \n(NRC) to discuss safeguards and security for NRC-licensed commercial \nnuclear power plants as well as certain legislation that has been \nintroduced to strengthen security at these facilities. I will discuss \nthe current status of actions that NRC has taken in response to the \nterrorist acts that occurred on September 11, and will outline some of \nthe work that lies ahead. I believe that the NRC's response to the \nattacks has been appropriate and thoughtful, and that the NRC's current \nprograms continue to provide a very high level of security. l also \nbelieve that certain specific legislative proposals, which I will \ndiscuss later, would contribute further to the enhancement of nuclear \nplant security and l would urge the Congress to enact this legislation \nbefore adjourning later this year.\n    The Commission recognizes the elevated concern of the American \npublic about the potential for terrorist attacks on nuclear facilities \nand the use of radioactive materials for purposes of terrorism. I hope \nthat my testimony today will provide a useful perspective for the \nCommittee and will correct any erroneous perceptions on this important \nsubject.\n    For decades before September 11, 2001, nuclear power plants were \namong the best defended and most hardened facilities of the Nation's \ncritical infrastructure. In the aftermath of the attacks, security has \nbeen enhanced even further. On September 11, the NRC immediately \nadvised the licensees of nuclear power plants and certain other \nlicensees to go to the highest level of security and they promptly did \nso. Our licensees have remained at the highest level of security since \nthat time.\n    We have maintained a steady flow of information with our licensees \nthrough over 30 updates to the original threat advisory. In February, \nwe issued Orders to each operating power reactor licensee specifying \nactions they must take to continue the high level of security to \nprotect the plants, and thereby to protect public health and safety and \ncommon defense and security.\n    The NRC receives a substantial and steady flow of information from \nthe intelligence community, law enforcement, and licensees that \nrequires prompt evaluation to assess threats to facilities or \nactivities regulated by the agency. The NRC routinely communicates with \nother Federal agencies, such as the Office of Homeland Security, the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of \nDefense. The protection of nuclear power plants and other nuclear \nfacilities and activities has been a matter on which the NRC has \nreceived assistance from across the Government."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Within a few weeks of the September 11 terrorist attacks, I, with \nthe full support of the Commission, directed the staff to conduct a \ncomprehensive re-evaluation of the current safeguards and security \nprograms. The review encompasses analysis of the agency's threat \nassessment framework and design basis threat, evaluation of facility \nvulnerabilities, access authorization processes, and emergency \npreparedness and response, and review of NBC's infrastructure, \nprograms, and communications.\n    In this connection, I specifically directed the staff to review the \nagency's organizational structure, staffing, and training in the \nsecurity and safeguards area. In early April 2002, the Commission \nestablished a new Office of Nuclear Security and Incident Response in \norder to consolidate NRC security, safeguards, and incident response \ncapabilities and resources. The primary responsibilities of this new \nOffice include safeguards and security programs and related policy \ndevelopment, threat assessment, and incident response operations."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","                         ADVISORIES AND ORDERS"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    As noted previously, after the events of September 11, 2001, \nthe.NRC issued numerous safeguards and threat advisories to our major \nlicensees in order to strengthen the licensees' capabilities and \nreadiness to respond to a potential attack on their facilities. The \nadvisories provide concise and relevant guidance relating to the need \nfor a given category of licensee to take specific action to enhance \nsecurity. Some of the specific measures implemented by the licensees in \nresponse to the advisories included increased patrols, augmented \nsecurity forces and capabilities, additional security posts, \ninstallation of additional physical barriers, vehicle checks at greater \nstand-off distances, enhanced coordination with law enforcement and \nmilitary authorities, and more restrictive site access controls.\n    The advisory process, which was in place prior to September 11, was \ndeveloped in order to ensure rapid communication and response to \npotential security concerns. It proved to be a quick and effective \nmeans for communicating with licensees. Subsequent inspections and \naudits by the NRC confirmed that licensees appropriately responded to \nthe actions specified in the advisories issued after the September 11 \nattacks. However, in light of the current threat environment, the \nCommission concluded that the additional actions to strengthen security \nat operating power reactors and other facilities should be embodied in \nan established regulatory framework. Therefore, on February 25, 2002, \nthe NRC issued Orders that modified the operating licenses for each of \nthe power reactors to require compliance with specified interim \ncompensatory measures.\n    A number of the Orders' requirements formalize measures specified \nin the advisories issued earlier, and have already been implemented. \nOther requirements provide additional security enhancements that have \nemerged from the on-going comprehensive safeguards and security program \nre-evaluation. Implementation of the requirements must be completed by \nAugust 31, 2002. A licensee would have to meet a very high threshold to \nreceive an extension of that date, and no such extension has been \ngranted thus far.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\1\\ Licensees were also required to submit a schedule of \nimplementation of the Orders' requirements within 20 days of the \nFebruary 25 Order. Requests have been received for extension of that \ndeadline, and are considered on a case-by-case basis. Granting an \nextension to the schedule submission does not change the requirement \nfor implementation of the February 25 Order by August 31. Nor does \ngranting an extension to the schedule submission deadline mean that a \nlicensee cannot meet the August 31 implementation deadline. Any \nextension dates granted for schedule submissions have been set so as to \nleave sufficient time to meet the implementation date of August 31.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    An Order was also issued on March 25, 2002, to the licensee of the \none existing uranium conversion facility. And, on May 24, the NRC \nissued Orders for the decommissioning reactor facilities. The NRC is \nalso developing Orders or considering other actions that will require \nimplementation of interim compensatory measures for other categories of \nlicensees.\n    The NRC will continue to evaluate whether further changes are \nneeded as part of our ongoing comprehensive safeguards and security \nprogram re-evaluation."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","                                 ISSUES"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    I would now like to discuss briefly a number of specific issues \nthat may be of interest to the Committee. These are: (1) the design \nbasis threat used to assess security readiness at nuclear facilities, \n(2) the threat of airborne attack, (3) the adequacy of security \nexercises at nuclear facilities, (4) personnel access authorization and \nrelated security background checks, and (5) protection of spent nuclear \nfuel. This will be followed by a discussion of proposed legislation.\n(1) Design Basis Threat\n    Security programs at certain NRC-licensed facilities, including \nnuclear power reactors, are designed to protect against a specified \nlevel of threat called the Design Basis Threat (DBT). After September \n11, the NRC initiated a re-examination of the basic threat assumptions \nunderlying the current civilian nuclear facility security programs, \nincluding its two established DBTs. The DBTs characterize the adversary \nforce against which certain NRC licensees (power reactors, Category I \nfuel cycle facilities, and transportation of Category I special nuclear \nmaterial) must design their physical protection systems and response \nstrategies. The NRC continually assesses the threat environment and \nregularly reviews the adequacy of the DBTs in close coordination with \nthe national intelligence and law enforcement community. Longer term \nrevisions to the DBTs are now needed to reflect changes in the threat \nenvironment. Commission is currently developing specific guidance to \nthe NRC staff for revising the DBTs. Any final decision on the DBTs \nwill be considered with appropriate stakeholders and Federal and The \nState agencies. These revisions will lead to changes in the security \nrequirements for licensed facilities and activities. The February 25 \nOrder referred to above includes enhancements to respond to the current \nthreat environment.\n(2) Airborne Attack\n    Following the use of commercial jetliners as missiles on September \n11, many questions have been raised regarding the potential effects on \npublic health and safety if an aircraft attack were made on a nuclear \nfacility. As we have stated many times, nuclear facilities are among \nthe most hardened industrial facilities. But no existing nuclear \nfacilities were specifically designed to withstand a deliberate, high-\nvelocity, direct impact of a large commercial airliner.\n    The capability of a plant to cope successfully with an aircraft \nimpact will, in the first instance, depend upon the plant's specific \ndesign features. It should be recognized that nuclear power plants are \nmassive structures with thick exterior walls and interior barriers of \nreinforced concrete. The plants are designed to withstand tornadoes, \nhurricanes, fires, floods, and earthquakes. As a result, the structures \ninherently afford a measure of protection against deliberate aircraft \nimpacts. In addition, the defense-in-depth philosophy used in nuclear \nfacility design means that plants have redundant and separated systems \nin order to ensure safety. That is, active components, such as pumps, \nhave backups as part of the basic design philosophy. This provides a \ncapability to respond to a variety of events, including aircraft \nattack.\n    It is also important to note that nuclear power plants have a \nrobust emergency preparedness program that includes biennial, evaluated \nexercises. In the event of a serious problem including a terrorist \nattack around a nuclear power plant, the plans and procedures that have \nbeen routinely exercised would be activated. This, provides a \ncapability to respond to events of all types, including aircraft \nattack.\n    In our recent Orders to nuclear power plant licensees, the \nCommission directed licensees to develop specific plans to respond to \nan event that results in damage to large areas of their plants from \nexplosions or fire. In addition, mitigative measures required by the \nOrders include assuring the presence of Emergency Plan staffing and \nassociated resources needed to respond to such an event. The NRC is \nalso continuing a major engineering evaluation relating, to the \nvulnerabilities and potential effects of a large commercial aircraft \nstriking a nuclear facility. This effort includes consideration of \nadditional mitigative and protective measures.\n    Suggestions have been made that anti-aircraft defenses should be \ninstalled at U.S. nuclear power plant sites. Such a step would present \nvery difficult command and control issues, and the use of such weaponry \ncould lead to significant collateral damage to plant workers and \nmembers of the public. Although the decision whether to deploy anti-\naircraft capability must rest with the military, the Commission \nbelieves that the best approach to dealing with threats from aircraft \nis through strengthening airport and airline security measures.\n(3) Security Exercises\n    The NRC has conducted force-on-force security exercises, known as \nOperational Safeguards Response Evaluations (OSREs), at nuclear reactor \nsites since 1991, and carried out similar tests before that time. These \nare tough, simulated commando-style raids, designed to identify \nshortcomings in security personnel performance or strategy \nIdentification of a weakness during an exercise leads to immediate, \ncorrective or compensatory measures. We are not aware of any comparable \nperformance testing of security measures for any other commercial \nfacilities in the United States.\n    Following the September 11 attacks, force-on-force exercises were \ntemporarily suspended because, in the heightened threat environment, \nthe conduct of exercises would be a significant distraction to security \nforces. In addition, the NRC had diverted its limited security \ninspection resources to staff response centers and to monitor and \nevaluate the licensees' heightened security posture. We recognize, \nhowever, that force-on-force drills are an important means to assess \nsecurity readiness. The NRC staff is currently preparing options for \nCommission consideration on how to reinstate security exercises. For \nexample, in the future we may involve local and State law enforcement \nin the exercises and we may look at beyond-design basis threats and the \nability of operator actions to mitigate any hypothetical damage caused \nby a beyond-design basis attack.\n(4) Personnel Access Authorization\n    The NRC's comprehensive security program re-evaluation includes an \nassessment of the personnel access authorization requirements and \nprograms at nuclear power facilities. This effort is intended, in part, \nto address potential insider threats.\n    Current NRC regulations, which are the toughest in any non-defense \nindustry in this country and which were in place prior to September 11, \ngenerally require an individual seeking unescorted access to a nuclear \npower plant to undergo a background investigation to verify the \nindividual's true identity and require the licensee to develop \ninformation about the person's background. The investigation includes \nreview of the individual's employment history, education history, \ncredit history, military service, and character and reputation, as well \nas a psychological assessment to evaluate trustworthiness and \nreliability. The background investigation also, includes a criminal \nhistory check conducted by the FBI.\\2\\ The requirements related to \nunescorted access are also supplemented by behavioral monitoring once \non the job, and random drug and alcohol testing as part of a \ncomprehensive fitness for duty program. Further, those who enter the \nprotected area pass through portal monitors that detect weapons or \nexplosives.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\2\\ Current NRC regulations allow an individual to obtain temporary \nunescorted access during the conduct of the criminal history check, but \nmany of the other requirements for unescorted access must be satisfied \nin such a situation. The Orders issued to commercial nuclear power \nlicensees in February required additional restrictions on the use of \ntemporary unescorted access authorizations.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    We took additional steps after September 11. The NRC, in \ncoordination with the FBI, checked NRC employees and licensee personnel \nagainst the FBI watch list established as part of the investigation of \nthe events of September 11. Since that time, we have been working, with \nthe Office of Homeland Security to facilitate information sharing among \nFederal agencies to enhance access to relevant information and improve \nthe access authorization programs.\n    The NRC is also coordinating with the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service (INS) in the effort to validate the employment \neligibility of employees at nuclear power plants. We seek to ensure \nthat only persons authorized to work in the U.S. are employed in \nnuclear power plants. However, there are limitations on the NRC's and \nits licensees' ability to obtain and use information available in INS \nand other Federal data bases for this purpose. For example, current law \n(8 U.S.C. Sec. 1342b) prohibits discrimination on the basis of alienage \nin the context of employment. This section has been interpreted to \npreclude asking non-citizens for more proof of identity than citizens. \nIn addition, in the process of dealing with access authorization, the \nConstitutional rights of both citizens and non-citizens must be \nprotected.\n(5) Spent Nuclear Fuel\n    Most of the radioactive material at power reactors is concentrated \nin the spent nuclear fuel that has been removed from the reactors. \nSpent nuclear fuel is stored at reactor sites in spent fuel pools or in \ndry cask storage facilities. Spent fuel pools use water to cool the \nspent fuel and shield personnel from radiation. The pools are robust \nstructures constructed of very thick concrete walls with stainless \nsteel liners, and are designed to withstand earthquakes. Spent fuel \ncasks are also robust, typically constructed of a combination of \nconcrete and steel that allow for air cooling of the spent fuel.\n    Spent fuel stored at NRC-licensed facilities poses a lesser \nsecurity challenge than an operating reactor because the risk to the \npublic health and safety is diminished. NBC's comprehensive safeguards \nand security program re-evaluation includes the consideration of \npotential consequences of terrorist attacks using various explosives or \nother techniques on spent fuel pools and spent nuclear fuel dry casks \nat storage sites. The program also addresses the transportation of \nspent fuel and other significant quantities of radioactive material.\n    The Orders issued by the Commision on February 25, 2002, to \noperating reactors, and on May 2, 2002, to decommissioning reactors and \nthe General Electric spent fuel storage facility, enhance the security \nmeasures for spent fuel stored in spent fuel pools. The specific \nsecurity measures are understandably sensitive, but generally include \nrequirements for increased patrols, augmented security forces and \ncapabilities, additional security posts, vehicle stand-off distances, \nand enhanced coordination with law enforcement and military \nauthorities. We will shortly issue a similar Order to independent spent \nfuel storage facilities using dry cask storage.\n    I would also like to address security during transportation. Our \nexisting regulations currently contain significant safety and security \nrequirements for the transport of radioactive material. After the \nSeptember 11, 2001 event, we also issued advisories to increase \nsecurity in transportation of specific types of radioactive material, \nincluding spent fuel shipments and shipments referred to as Highway \nRoute Controlled Quantities of radioactive material. In order to codify \nthe advisories, the Commission is currently in the process of issuing \nOrders to licensees shipping specific quantities of radioactive \nmaterial and will be considering, expedited rulemaking in this area as \nwell. We will also review transportation requirements as part of our \ncomprehensive review of the safeguards and security programs that I \npreviously mentioned."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","                           LEGISLATIVE NEEDS"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Since the events of September 11, 2001, many Members of Congress \nhave asked the NRC how they can help to improve the security at nuclear \npower plants and other facilities. In response, the Commission has \nrequested that Congress enact several specific legislative proposals \nthat would amend three sections of the Atomic Energy Act. These \nproposals were contained in an omnibus bill the Commission transmitted \nto the Congress in June of last year and in letters I sent to Congress \nthis fiscal year. The NRC has been seeking enactment of most of these \namendments for almost 15 years. Most of these provisions are contained \nin S. 1586, which was introduced by Senators. Inhofe and Smith at the \nend of last October. I should note that all of our proposals have been \ncoordinated with the executive branch and enjoy the strong support of \nthe Administration.\n    One of the proposals would provide Federal authorization for guards \nto carry and use firearms at NRC-regulated facilities designated by the \nCommission, and to protect property of significance to the common \ndefense and security located at, or being transported to or from, such \nfacilities. The proposal would enhance national security by eliminating \nseveral weaknesses under the current safeguards and security regime. In \nparticular, this amendment could provide some protection for licensee \nguards from State criminal prosecution for actions taken during the \nperformance of their official duties. Ameliorating guards' concerns \nregarding State prosecution should make their actions more dependable \nin situations calling for use of their weapons.\n    The Atomic Energy Act permits the Department of Energy (DOE) and \nits contractors and subcontractors engaged in the protection of \nproperty located at nuclear facilities, or being transported to or from \nsuch facilities, to carry arms, make arrests, and use force as the \nDepartment deems necessary in the interests of the common defense and \nsecurity. As a result, DOE guards may be shielded from State criminal \nprosecution for actions taken during the performance of their official \nduties. However, this does not apply to guards at NRC-licensed \nfacilities. State laws govern the use of weapons by guards at NRC-\nlicensed facilities, and some States laws do not permit guards to use \nweapons, except to protect against an immediate threat to their own \nlives or the lives of others. In such States, it may not be possible to \nshield the guards at NRC-licensed facilities from State criminal \nprosecution for actions taken during the performance of official \nduties.\n    This difference between the protections offered to DOE guards and \nguard's at NRC-licensed facilities exists even where both are \nprotecting special nuclear material. Several years ago, Congress \nextended the protections applicable to DOE guards to guards at the \ngaseous diffusion facilities. operated by the United States Enrichment \nCorporation. It would seem logical to extend equivalent protections to \nguards at NRC-licensed or certified facilities designated by the \nCommission.\n    In addition, some State laws make it difficult for licensees or \ntheir security, contractors to use more effective weaponry. To \nalleviate this problem, the Commission has developed an addition to the \nproposed amendment establishing Federal authorization for guards to \ncarry and use firearms at NRC-regulated facilities. This additional \nprovision--not included in S. 1586--would authorize the guards to carry \nand use, where necessary to the discharge of their official duties, \nsuch weapons as the Commission may require, pursuant to guidelines \nissued with the concurrence of the Attorney General. A copy of the \noriginal proposal with additional language--to address this concern is \nattached to my written statement.\n    Another provision would make it a Federal crime to bring \nunauthorized weapons and explosives into NRC-licensed facilities. There \nhave been a number of reported incidents where persons without \nauthorization have brought firearms into protected areas of NRC-\nregulated sites. Although the NRC may impose sanctions against the \nlicensee for violations of its security regulations, there is no \nFederal law permitting the imposition of criminal sanctions against the \nperson responsible for bringing the weapon or other dangerous \ninstrument to the site. This amendment would assist NRC licensees in \ntheir efforts to safeguard licensed nuclear facilities and materials \nthat must be protected against radiological sabotage or nuclear theft. \nIt would permit the NRC to promulgate regulations prohibiting the \nunauthorized introduction of weapons into NRC-regulated sites. \nViolation of the regulations would constitute a Federal crime, which \ncould result in a fine or imprisonment, or both.\n    Our final proposal would make Federal prohibitions on sabotage \napplicable to the operation and construction of such NRC-licensed or \ncertified facilities as nuclear reactors and enrichment and fuel \nfabrication facilities. This amendment would provide criminal sanctions \nfor sabotage or attempted sabotage of such a facility during its \noperation or construction where the action could affect public health \nand safety during the operation of the facility.\n    We believe that the modest legislative changes that I have \ndescribed will contribute to enhancing the security of nuclear \nfacilities and material. S. 1586 contains provisions that are similar \nto these proposals, except that it does not contain the more recently \ndeveloped provision I have described authorizing guards to carry and \nuse, where necessary to the discharge of their official duties, such \nweapons as the Commission may require, pursuant to guidelines issued \nwith the concurrence of the Attorney General.\nS. 1746\n    The Commission opposes S. 1746, which would Federalize the security \nforces at commercial nuclear facilities. There are several fundamental \ndifficulties with this legislation.\n    First, S. 1746 separates the strategy for the security of nuclear \nfacilities from that of all other types of sensitive facilities (e.g., \nchemical plants, refineries, and dams). We believe society's defensive \nresources should be allocated in accordance with relative risk, and \nthat the separation of nuclear facilities from all other types of \nsensitive facilities will fragment the overall consideration of risk \ninappropriately. Since resources are not infinite, disproportionate \nprotection at one kind of facility may increase the risks at other \nkinds of facilities.\n    Second, the requirement that the NRC establish a security force for \nsensitive nuclear facilities addresses a non-existent problem. S. 1746 \nwould require the hiring of thousands of new Federal guards to displace \nthe private security forces now used by licensees. The private guard \nforces that exist today at such facilities are qualified, trained, and \ntightly regulated. There is no need, unlike the situation of airports, \nto Federalize security at such plants. There have been no failures in \nnuclear plant security that would warrant the creation of a new Federal \nsecurity force for NRC-licensed facilities.\n    Third, S. 1746 would bring about a fundamental shift in the \nresponsibility and mission of the NRC. The demands of the legislation \nwould refocus the NRC principally as an agency to ensure nuclear \nsecurity, which could have the unintended consequence of detracting \nfrom the Commission's mission to protect the public health and safety \nfrom radiological hazards.\n    Fourth, NRC's role as an independent regulator would be compromised \nby the bill's requirement that the NRC design security plans for all \nsensitive nuclear facilities, implement the plans with NRC employees, \nand then conduct safeguards evaluations of the efficacy of the \nimplementation of those plans. In the security area, the legislation \nwould force the, NRC to regulate its own activities.\n    Fifth, the bill would create command and control difficulties \nbecause it would establish two classes of, employees at commercial \nnuclear sites, both of which would be responsible for safety in the \nevent of a terrorist attack--licensee personnel responsible to the \nlicensee for safe operations and Federal employees responsible to the \nNRC for security. In an emergency situation, these separate lines of \nauthority could, in fact, lead to a diminution of the capacity to \nensure safety.\n    Sixth, making guards at nuclear facilities employees of the \nCommission (as S. 1746 would do) would require significant additional \nresources that could be used more effectively in other efforts to \nenhance the security of the nation's infrastructure. Moreover, given \nthe enhancement in the security threat against which the guard force \nwould be required to defend in accordance with the proposed \nlegislation, the NRC would be required to hire more than 5,000 new \nFederal workers, which is nearly twice the number of staff now employed \nby the agency.\n    These fundamental difficulties in S. 1746 argue against its \nadoption, but there are also other concerns raised by the bill, \nincluding the following:\n    <bullet> S. 1746 does not alleviate concerns, arising from State \nlaw, similar to those described earlier in my discussion of differences \nbetween the situation of guards at DOE facilities and guards at NRC-\nlicensed facilities.\n    <bullet> S. 1746 would create a ``Nuclear Security Fund,'' to be \nused to pay costs of salaries, training, and other expenses of the \nnuclear security force established by the bill as well as costs of \ndeveloping and implementing security plans. To ensure that adequate \namounts are available for these purposes, the Commission would be \ndirected to assess licensees a fee ``not to exceed 1 mill per kilowatt-\nhour of electricity generated'' by ``sensitive nuclear facilities''. \nThis does not take into account that a significant portion of those \nfacilities (for example, decommissioned nuclear power plants) do not \nproduce electricity.\n    <bullet> S. 1746 would create a new NRC Office (the Operations \nSafeguards and Response Unit) within the NRC. This aspect of the \nlegislation has already been accomplished and thus the statutory \nprovision is unnecessary. In early April of this year the Commission \nestablished a centralized security organization within the NRC--the \nOffice of Nuclear Security and Incident Response. This office combines \nsecurity responsibilities previously exercised by the Office of Nuclear \nMaterial Safety and Safeguards and the Office of Nuclear Reactor \nRegulation.\n    <bullet> S. 1746 provides a new focus on Federal-State \nrelationships. For example, until now States have borne the primary \nresponsibility for emergency response. However, the bill would require \nthe Commission to certify that stockpiles of potassium iodide (KI) \ntablets have been established within a 50-mile radius of sensitive \nnuclear facilities, and to develop plans for prompt distribution of the \nstockpiles in the event of a release of radionuclides. Thus, S. 1746 \nwould require intrusion by the NRC into the States' responsibilities in \nthis area. In addition, Congress recently addressed the subject of KI \ndistribution in the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism \nPreparedness and Response Act of 2002, which now awaits Presidential \nsignature. No further legislation regarding Kl is warranted.\n    In light of the above considerations, the Commission believes that \nthe current system, with coordination of security and safety through, \norganizations subject to NRC regulatory scrutiny, is clearly preferable \nto that proposed by S. 1746."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    In closing, the events of September 11 have had, and continue to \nhave, a significant effect on both the NRC and our licensees. \nNonetheless, our licensees' primary responsibility of ensuring safe \noperation of their facilities, and the NBC's fundamental mission of \nprotecting public health and safety, have not changed. Licensees' \nphysical protection programs in place prior to September 11 continue to \nbe effective in protecting the public, and have been appropriately \nenhanced since September 11. Moreover, the NRC continues to work with a \nvariety of agencies, including the Office of Homeland Security, in an \neffort to develop an integrated national strategy to deal with critical \ninfrastructure. We continue to believe that nuclear security would be \nenhanced by enactment of the legislation proposed by the NRC. We look \nforward to working with the Congress both on the enactment of the NRC \nlegislative proposals I have discussed and on continuing to ensure \nadequate protection of the public health and safety and the common \ndefense and security.\n    I appreciate being here today to discuss the NRC's programs and am \nprepared to answer your questions."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 1. In your December 3rd letter to the Committee, you noted \nthat NRC had a two-phase project to understand plant vulnerabilities to \nattacks by either commercial or general aviation aircraft, which you \nagain mentioned today. The first phase was to be completed in January \nof 2002 and the second in June of this year. Can you please update the \nCommittee on the progress of this project? Specifically, what have your \nstudies determined about the ability of containment vessels to \nwithstand assault by a modern aircraft?\n    Response. The first phase of the project was completed in January \n2002. Simplified analyses were performed to estimate the response of \nkey buildings and structures. Insights from the first phase were used \nto develop the interim compensatory measures. Specific insights from \nthe first phase, including perspectives on the ability of containment \nto withstand various loads, have been classified as national security \ninformation.\n    The staff used the insights from the first phase to develop plans \nfor the detailed analyses in the second phase. Detailed models of \nrepresentative structures and aircraft have been developed and \ncalculations were performed to demonstrate the ability to perform the \nanalyses. Aviation fuel combustion and fire propagation were also \nincluded in these analyses. These models are now being used to refine \nthe insights from the first phase. The results of these analyses are \nalso classified. I should also note that we are in contact with certain \nforeign governments, who are conducting similar classified \nvulnerability assessments, to peer review our results and to gain \nadditional insights from their work.\n    In my December 3, 2001 letter, I indicated that the need to perform \nadditional work may be identified as the work progressed. Based on the \ninsights gained to date, additional research and analyses are being \nplanned to further refine vulnerability and consequence assessments, \nand to support evaluation of the effectiveness of compensatory \nmeasures. This work is currently planned through June 2003. NRC is also \ndeveloping an experimental program to quantify more definitively the \naccuracy of the analysis methods in predicting (1) the performance of \nreinforced concrete structures under extreme loads, (2) dispersion of \naviation fuel on impact, and (3) fire propagation. The experimental \nprogram is currently expected to continue through 2005."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 2. NRC has not yet issued a revised Design Basis Threat, \nbut has required that the nuclear industry implement interim security \nmeasures. As I understand it, in the normal course of events, security \nmeasures are based on a defined DBT. A DBT is defined first, and \nsecurity plans are developed to meet that Threat. How were the interim \nsecurity measures determined if a new DBT has not been defined? How can \nwe be assured the interim measures are adequate if they are not based \non an agreed DBT?\n    Response. The design basis threat (DBT) for radiological sabotage \nwas established in the 1970s and modified at various times since then \nso as to enable licensees to develop security plans to meet that \nthreat. In the elevated threat environment that has existed since \nSeptember 11, the Commission decided that immediate upgrades in \nsecurity were necessary. Rather than change the DBT, the Commission \nissued advisories and then issued Orders to establish a variety of \nprescriptive requirements to enhance security. These enhancements \ninclude increased numbers of guards, increased weaponry, tightened \naccess controls, increased standoff distances, as well as other \nchanges. Because these prescriptive measures were highly specific, they \nwere unambiguous and could be put in place quickly. The introduction of \nchanges by way of modification to the DBT, by contrast, would have \ndelayed implementation because of the need for the licensees to analyze \nthe DBT to determine the additional measures that were necessary in \norder to satisfy it. In light of the comprehensive nature of the \nactions required by the Commission, the NRC is satisfied that an \nappropriate security capability is in place.\n    The NRC is undertaking a revision of its security requirements and \nthe DBT at this time. In fact, the staff expects to submit a first \ndraft of the revised DBT to the Commission within the next few months. \nChanges to the DBT will be coordinated with the other agencies of the \nGovernment."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 3. On the other hand, if the interim measures are in fact \nbased on an assumed threat, then the NRC must already have a good idea \nof what a revised DBT should be. Why hasn't NRC issued the revised DBT \nyet?\n    Response. No agency of Government has revised its DBT as yet as a \nresult of September 11. The Commission has put in place a process that \nwill lead to a staff recommendation for a revised DBT in the next few \nmonths. The NRC is coordinating with appropriate Federal agencies as it \ndevelops a revised DBT to ensure full consideration is given to \ninformation from the intelligence community and others."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 4. In your recent letter to me on the damage that small \nplanes could cause to a reactor, you noted that you do not expect a \nsmall plane attack to result in a ``serious threat to public health and \nsafety.'' Please describe what kind of threat to public health and \nsafety such an attack might pose, even if not deemed serious by your \nstandards. Could such an attack disable several safety-related systems \nat once? Could such an attack conceivably result in ``total station \nblackout'', where all power to the reactor is cut off?\n    Response. A small plane is extremely unlikely to penetrate nuclear \npower plant structures in a way that would disable several safety-\nrelated systems at once. Therefore, the impact of a small plane into a \nsite structure is unlikely to cause either core damage or containment \nfailure, both of which are required for a significant offsite release. \nSuch an impact thus does not post a serious threat to public health and \nsafety.\n    Such an attack could conceivably cause the loss of offsite power. \nThe Commission's regulations require that each plant must be able to \nrecover from a station blackout. Nuclear power plants are designed with \nredundant emergency electrical power sources, in particular emergency \ndiesel generators, which provide electrical power to safety system \nequipment in the case off-site power is not available."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 5. Does the NRC intend to continue to run the OSRE force-\non-force exercises? When do you think these exercises will resume? Who \nserves as the mock terrorists in these exercises? I understand that up \nuntil recently, these exercises were only run about once every eight \nyears. How often will these exercises be performed at each facility in \nthe future?\n    Response. Following the September 11 attacks, NRC-evaluated force-\non-force exercises were temporarily suspended because, in the \nheightened threat environment, the conduct of exercises could create \nvulnerabilities and would be a significant distraction to security \nforces. Moreover, the NRC had diverted its security inspection \nresources to staff response centers and to monitor and evaluate the \nlicensees' heightened security posture. We recognize that force-on-\nforce drills are an important means to assess security readiness and \nthe NRC intends to re-initiate these drills. We are doing so by \ninitially exercising the table top component of the exercises and will \nthen expand the exercises to include a force-on-force component. Our \ngoal is to evaluate an integrated security exercise at each site every \nthree years. Licensees conduct more frequent exercises as part of their \ntraining programs.\n    Throughout the OSRE program, the licensees have provided the \npersonnel to make up the mock terrorist team for the exercises, subject \nto supervision by the NRC's experts. Some licensees trade teams of mock \nadversaries, which provides teams with the requisite expertise, but \nwithout the day-to-day knowledge of each site. This provides a more \nrealistic simulation of the presumed expertise of the potential \nterrorists."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 6. In your December 17 response to the Committee, the \nCommission indicated that the performance of more frequent periodic \ndrills and exercises ``could enhance our licensees' capabilities to \nprotect against the design basis threat of radiological sabotage.'' \nHave you budgeted for increased exercises in the future?\n    Response. Yes, the NRC is budgeting for more frequent exercises and \nmore oversight of the licensees' security programs in general."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 7. Is the NRC looking into how spent fuel can be better \nsecured through dry cask storage?\n    Response. Spent fuel pools are robust structures constructed of \nvery thick concrete walls with stainless steel liners, and are designed \nto withstand earthquakes. Spent fuel casks are also robust, typically \nconstructed of a combination of concrete and steel that allow for air \ncooling of the spent fuel. Both pools and casks can be used to store \nspent fuel safely and securely in accordance with NRC requirements.\n    The comprehensive safeguards and security program re-evaluation \nbeing conducted by the NRC includes the consideration of potential \nconsequences of terrorist attacks using various explosives or other \ntechniques on spent fuel pools and spent nuclear fuel dry casks at \nstorage sites. The Commission continues to evaluate the need for \nadditional interim compensatory measures."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 8. When was the Design Basis Threat last revised?\n    Response. The DBT was last revised in 1994 to include a vehicle \nthreat. This change to the DBT was reflected in a revision to 10 CFR \n73.55 and required licensees to provide measures for protection against \na vehicle being used as a means of transporting personnel or explosives \nto the proximity of vital areas. Certain of the guidance relating to \nthe implementation of the DBT has been subject to subsequent revision."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 9. Is it true that the current DBT does not include a \nwaterborne component? Does it include an airborne component?\n    Response. Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Section \n73.1(a) defines the design basis threat in general terms. Specific \ndetails of the DBT are considered sensitive Safeguards Information and \ncannot be included as part of the public record. We would be pleased to \nrespond to the question in a different forum."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 1. During the hearing, there seemed to be some confusion \nabout the NRC's and your concerns regarding the federalization of a \nnuclear plant guard force. Can you please address this confusion?\n    Response. The Commission opposes Senate bill S. 1746, which would \nfederalize the security forces at commercial nuclear facilities. All \nNRC commissioners have given the matter careful consideration, and \nunanimously oppose federalization. The Commission's concerns are \ndescribed in detail in Chairman Meserve's written testimony submitted \nfor the June 5, 2002 hearing."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 2. Could you please go into greater detail about the \ncommunication enhancements that have occurred following September 11th? \nSpecifically, between the various federal agencies and NRC, the \nagencies and plants, and the plants and NRC.\n    Response. The NRC has maintained steady communication with the \nintelligence community throughout the years. However, since September \n11, we have increased this communication to stay abreast of potential \nchanges in the threat environment.\n    Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, the NRC issued \nover 30 advisories to its licensees, focusing on the threat to the \nnuclear industry and providing guidance as to measures that should be \nconsidered by licensees to enhance the security at their facilities. \nFollowing these advisories, Orders have been issued to certain classes \nof licensees, including the licensees for power reactors, \ndecommissioning power reactors, a uranium conversion facility, gaseous \ndiffusion plants, and Category I fuel facilities, requiring the \nimplementation of interim compensatory measures designed to protect \nagainst an adversary force in excess of the design basis threat. We are \npreparing Orders for independent spent fuel storage installations, \nCategory III fuel facilities, and licensees who ship or receive large \nquantities of radioactive material. We are also evaluating the need to \nissue Orders to certain other licensees.\n    The NRC has held various workshops with members of industry to \ndiscuss security at licensed facilities, including the means of testing \nthe security programs that have been enhanced. Licensees have regularly \nprovided information and reports to the NRC summarizing their security \nenhancements, the level of commitment of resources from the State and \nlocal agencies, and the weapons assigned to their security force. \nLicensees also regularly report suspicious activity, including cars and \npedestrians approaching the facility, fly-overs by aircraft, and boats \napproaching by waterway.\n    The NRC has participated in many of the Office of Homeland \nSecurity's working groups and workshops, conferences, and meetings \nregarding the status of various initiatives, such as the Homeland \nSecurity Advisory System. The agency's participation in these \nconferences and meetings has been very useful and the NRC will continue \nto support them.\n    For several weeks following September 11, an NRC employee was \nassigned to the FBI's Strategic Information Operations Center (SIOC). \nThe NRC has maintained regular communications with the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, the Coast Guard, the Pentagon (particularly NORAD), and \nother Federal agencies to provide a forum for better information \nexchange on security issues.\n    The NRC is in the process of deploying Secure Telecommunications \nUnits (STU) and Secure Terminal Equipment (STE) at the offices of our \nResident Inspectors at each nuclear power plant. This will allow the \nNRC to communicate sensitive and classified information to and from \neach site directly.\n    The NRC continues to maintain a liaison with the Office of Homeland \nSecurity on matters relating to threats. In addition, the NRC continues \nto support national efforts in Continuity of Government (COG) and \nContinuity of Operations (COOP) programs."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 3. In regards to the security forces at the nuclear \nfacilities, the NRC has repeatedly asked for over 15 years that they be \nallowed to carry arms, use force, and make arrests. Can you please \nexplain the current situation at facilities across our nation and how \nthe lack of this authority jeopardizes our national security? For \nexample, what do these forces have the ability to do today and what can \nthey not do?\n    Response. The security forces at the nuclear facilities are armed \nwith sidearms for routine duties and tactical response weapons for \nresponding to safeguards contingencies. The two principal changes that \nthe Commission seeks is Federal authority to use deadly force and to \ncarry weapons comparable to those used at Department of Energy \nfacilities.\n    One provision would authorize guards at NRC-regulated facilities to \ncarry and use firearms to protect property of significance to the \ncommon defense and security. This provision is aimed at giving guards \nsome protection from State criminal prosecution for actions taken \nduring the performance of their official duties. Another provision \nwould allow the Commission, in consultation with the Attorney General, \nto confer upon guards at NRC-designated facilities the authority to \npossess or use weapons that are comparable to those available to the \nDepartment of Energy guard forces. Some State laws currently preclude \nprivate guard forces at NRC-regulated facilities from utilizing a wide \nrange of weapons. These provisions would allow guard forces to respond \nwith comparable weapons in the event of an assault on a nuclear site by \na sophisticated, well armed adversary group."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 4. What kind of crime is it today to bring unauthorized \nweapons and explosives into an NRC-licensed facility? Also, please \nexplain NRC's requested sabotage provisions and the expected effects.\n    Response. At present, only individual State laws prohibit bringing \nweapons and explosives into an NRC-licensed facility. The NRC has \nrequested legislation that would make it a Federal crime to bring \nunauthorized weapons and explosives into NRC-licensed facilities and to \ncreate Federal prohibitions against sabotage applicable to both \noperation and construction of nuclear facilities. The NRC has been \nseeking legislative authority for most of these changes for almost \nfifteen years."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 5. Could you please speak to the claim that force-on-force \ntests by the NRC since 1991 have been below NRC's minimum expectations \nnearly half of the time?\n    Response. The force-on-force drills that are conducted during an \nOperational Safeguards Response Evaluation (OSRE) are limited scope \ndrills designed to test the licensee's ability to protect the plant \nagainst a violent external assault by a mock adversary force having the \ncharacteristics of the design basis threat. Typically, four drills were \nconducted at each site and results were documented.\n    The attacking force is credited with detailed knowledge of the \nplant's lay-out, vulnerabilities and security force defense plans, \nacquired through table top exercises carried out before the force-on-\nforce drills. The overall goal of the OSRE is to improve the efficacy \nof facility security by immediate identification and correction of \nweaknesses.\n    In 37 of 81 OSREs conducted between August 1991 and August 2001, \nthe NRC identified weaknesses.\\1\\ In other words, the licensee did not \nget a perfect score. For those plants at which a weakness was found, \nthe attacking force was typically able in one of the four drills to \nreach a target set and simulate destruction of that equipment. In \ngeneral, these weaknesses occurred due to deficiencies in the \nlicensee's contingency response plan, in training, or in executing the \nplan. No one issue dominates the weaknesses found.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\1\\ For the 15 OSREs conducted between April 2000 and August 2001, \na total of 59 exercises were conducted. Weaknesses were identified in 9 \nof 59 exercises or 15 percent of the time. Eighty-five percent of the \ntime the attacking force was defeated.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    It is agency policy for NRC licensees to address identified \nweaknesses immediately through the implementation of compensatory \nmeasures and, where appropriate, permanent corrective actions. The NRC \nbelieves that the program has served an important function by \ncontributing to the identification of areas for improvement in the \nlicensees' security programs. The tests are considered challenging \nbecause they are designed to exploit potential vulnerabilities revealed \nin associated table top drills. They do not necessarily reflect the \nlikelihood of success by a less informed attacking force."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 6. In his testimony, Dr. Irwin Redlener alleges that \ndepending on the extent of damage to the reactor, its support systems \nand spent fuel containment systems. Excess cancers from radiation \nexposures can range into the tens of thousands.'' Does NRC agree with \nthat statement?\n    Response. No. We believe that Dr. Redlener's consequence estimates \nof immediate civilian fatalities and excess cancers do not consider the \nlikely range of consequences from an attack on a nuclear power plant.\n    The NRC has performed a large number of analyses of the risks and \nconsequences from severe reactor accidents. From these studies, we \nconclude that the risks and consequences are generally dominated by \nevents involving a sustained loss of cooling. Events involving a \nsustained loss of cooling would proceed, in terms of fuel damage \nprogression, in much the same manner regardless of whether the \ninitiator was an accident or an intentional terrorist act. Possible \ndifferences between core damage accidents initiated by terrorist \nattacks and those initiated by other accidental means are being \nassessed.\n    From our past severe accident studies, we conclude that only events \ninvolving both rapid core melt and early failure of the enclosing \ncontainment building could lead to immediate public fatalities. It is \nunlikely that terrorist attacks will result in rapid core melt or early \ncontainment failure because of the reactor's diverse and redundant \nsafety features and robust containment. Thus, the expected number of \nprompt fatalities among the public is zero. In the unlikely event that \nrapid core melt and early containment failure were to occur, \npreliminary analyses indicate only a few immediate public fatalities, \nif any, at a representative site. The number of immediate fatalities \nnear the plant is expected to be small, because of the preplanned \nemergency response actions for this population and the high threshold \ndose for immediate fatalities. In this connection, it should be noted \nthat the number of prompt fatalities from the effects of radiation of \nthe Chernobyl accident, including plant workers and firemen, was about \n30.\n    Public fatalities would not be expected in an attack on a spent \nfuel pool unless the pool were to drain rapidly with no cooling \nmeasures available for an extended period of time. Rapid draining of \nthe pool as a result of a terrorist attack is highly unlikely because \nof the robustness of the spent fuel pool and its large inventory of \nwater. The much lower decay heat of the spent fuel in the pool would \npermit emergency cooling of the fuel using readily available measures \nthat could be accomplished without significant exposure of workers to \nradiation and would also provide additional time to evacuate the area \nnear the plant to prevent immediate fatalities in the event the pool \nwere to drain rapidly. Also, in comparison to an operating reactor, the \nspent fuel in the pool has a lower inventory of radioactive isotopes \nthat contribute to early health effects. All of these factors make it \nunlikely that a terrorist attack on a spent fuel pool would result in \nany immediate public fatalities.\n    Similarly, because it is unlikely that a terrorist attack would \nresult in rapid core melt and early containment failure and failure of \npreplanned emergency response actions, we believe that the number of \nadditional latent cancers, if any, resulting from a terrorist attack \nwould likely not be detectable as an increase in the normal background \ncancer rate. Estimates of latent (long term) cancer fatalities are \ntypically based on the assumption that increasing levels of exposure \nresult in a proportional increase in the risk of cancer, even at very \nlow radiation doses. This assumption, which is referred to as the \nlinear-nonthreshold (LNT) hypothesis, may be conservative, but it is \ncustomarily used for purposes of regulatory decision making. The high \nnormal background cancer rate makes refinement of the models that \nquantify the increase in cancer due to low levels of exposure \ndifficult.\n    The LNT hypothesis can predict large numbers of latent cancer \nfacilities when very small exposures are received by a very large \nnumber of people. To put this in perspective, scheduled domestic \nairline travel totals about 500 billion passenger miles per year. \nAccording to the LNT hypothesis, the radiation exposure associated with \nthe airline travel would result in thousands of fatal cancers in the \nfollowing decades.\n    In summary, we believe that Dr. Redlener's consequence estimates \noverstate the consequences from an attack on a nuclear power plant. \nEstimated consequences are very dependent upon a number of parameters \nincluding timeliness of evacuations, weather conditions and site \nspecific characteristics. As indicated above, more realistic \nassumptions result in significantly smaller consequences than those \nsuggested by Dr. Redlener."

In his testimony, Dr. Irwin Redlener alleges that \n``Studies . . . have concluded that thousands of square miles could be \ncontaminated and uninhabitable for years or decades under a variety of \nhighly plausible attack scenarios.'' Does NRC agree with that \nstatement?\n    Response. No. The only reactor events that could lead to a release \nof radioactivity that could potentially contaminate the land to levels \nthat would make it uninhabitable involve both core melt and containment \nfailure. However, as discussed in the response to the Question 7, a \nterrorist attack is unlikely to result in rapid core melt and early \ncontainment failure. More slowly evolving scenarios provide additional \ntime for local authorities and reactor operators to intervene to \nprevent a release. Attacks on a spent fuel pool are less likely to lead \nto such a release because even if an attack could somehow drain the \nwater from the spent fuel pool, the lower decay heat of the spent fuel \nin the pool would provide additional time for intervention to prevent a \nrelease."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 8. S. 1746 would provide for mandatory stockpiling of \npotassium iodide tablets for use by populations within a 50-mile radius \nof nuclear power plants, as compared to the current NRC program for \nvoluntary stockpiling within 10 miles and the provision for voluntary \nstockpiling up to 20 miles included in the ``Public Health Security and \nBioterrorism Preparedness Response Act of 2002.'' What are the \nCommission's views on the need to stockpile potassium iodide for \npopulations out to 50 miles from a nuclear power plant?\n    Response. The Commission believes that distribution of potassium \niodide (KI) within the 10-mile emergency planning zone (EPZ) is a \nreasonable and prudent measure for specific accident scenarios under \nconditions that involve a significant release of radioactive iodides. \nWe do not agree that there is a need to stockpile KI for populations \nbeyond the 10-mile EPZ.\n    The objective of emergency response is to minimize the dose \nreceived by the public from a spectrum of accidents that could produce \ndoses in excess of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Protective \nAction Guides (PAGs). PAGs are radiation doses that warrant the \nimplementation of protective actions for the public.\n    There are two EPZs around nuclear power plants. These are the 10-\nmile plume exposure EPZ and the 50-mile ingestion pathway EPZ. There \nare PAGs established for the 10-mile plume exposure EPZ as well as for \nthe 50-mile ingestion pathway EPZ. Separate PAGs are established for \neach EPZ because the health risks to the public are different. The PAGs \nfor the 10-mile EPZ are established to avoid early health effects. The \nprotective actions include evacuation and sheltering, with \nconsideration to be given of KI distribution. The PAGs for the 50-mile \nEPZ are established to reduce the risk of long-term or latent health \neffects. The protective actions include interdiction of contaminated \nfood, relocation of a population out of a contaminated area, placing \nfarm animals on stored feed, and access control to contaminated areas.\n    The reason for the different approach is because only the \npopulation close (within the 10-mile EPZ) to the nuclear power plant is \nat meaningful risk of exposure to radiation and radioactive materials \nfrom exposure to the plume. Evacuation is the most effective protective \nmeasure in the event of a radiological emergency because it protects \nthe whole body (including the thyroid gland and other organs) from all \nradionuclides and all exposure pathways. However, in situations when \nevacuation is not feasible, in-place sheltering is substituted as an \neffective protective action. In addition, administering potassium \niodide is a reasonable, prudent, and inexpensive supplement to \nevacuation and sheltering for specific local conditions. When the \npopulation is evacuated out of the plume and potentially contaminated \nfoodstuffs are embargoed, the risk from further radioactive iodine \nexposure to the thyroid gland is eliminated.\n    Beyond the 10-mile EPZ, the primary radiation exposure route is the \ningestion of radionuclides (including radioactive iodides) from water \nor contaminated foodstuff (including milk). Therefore, the primary \nprotective action strategy beyond the 10-mile EPZ is eliminating \nconsumption of contaminated food and water, as well as access controls \nand decontamination. While KI is a component of the protective strategy \nwithin the plume exposure pathway EPZ during the plume phase of the \nevent, restricting consumption of contaminated foodstuff up to 50 miles \nfrom the plant in the direction of the release, as needed, is part of \nthe overall protective strategy for all radionuclides. If ingestion is \nprevented, there is no benefit to KI administration. Moreover, the risk \narises from ingestion of contaminated food or water over a long time. \nIt is inappropriate to use KI to deal with chronic exposure."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 9. S. 1746 would provide for planning of evacuation of \npopulations from within a 50-mile radius surrounding nuclear power \nplants in the event of an emergency, as compared to the current Federal \nemergency program that includes planning for evacuation out to 10 miles \nfrom nuclear power plants. What are the Commission's views on the need \nto plan for evacuation out to 50 miles from a nuclear power plant?\n    Response. The Commission does not support a requirement for the \nplanning of evacuation of the population out to a 50-mile radius from a \nnuclear power plant. The Commission requires that two emergency \nplanning zones (EPZs) be established around each nuclear power plant; \nan EPZ of about 10 miles in radius for planning to protect the public \nfrom airborne exposure (the plume exposure pathway) and an EPZ of about \n50 miles in radius for planning for actions to prevent radioactive \nmaterial from entering the food chain (the ingestion pathway). The size \nof the EPZs represents a judgment as to the extent of detailed planning \nthat must be performed to ensure an adequate response based on the \nconsideration of the probabilities and consequences of a spectrum of \naccidents.\n    For the 10-mile plume exposure EPZ, shelter, evacuation and \nprophylactic use of KI would be the likely principal immediate \nprotective actions recommended to the general public. For the 50-mile \ningestion pathway EPZ the planning effort involves the identification \nof major exposure pathways from contaminated food and water and the \nassociated control points and mechanisms. The ingestion pathway \nexposures in general would represent a longer term problem, although \nsome early protective actions to minimize subsequent contamination of \nmilk or other supplies should be considered.\n    The Commission evaluated several factors in establishing the size \nof the EPZs. These included risk, probability, cost effectiveness and \nthe accident consequence spectrum. The Commission chose to base the \nsize of the EPZs on the probability of a spectrum of accidents and the \ncorresponding consequences. The Commission requires that emergency \nresponse plans be useful for responding to any accident that would \nproduce offsite doses in excess of the EPA's Protective Action Guides \n(PAGs). These accidents include the more severe design basis accidents. \nAfter reviewing the potential consequences of these types of accidents, \nthe Commission determined that emergency plans should be based upon a \ngeneric distance within which predetermined actions would minimize the \ndose received by the public. Based on the source term resulting from \nthis spectrum of accidents and the applicable PAGs, a radius of about \n10 miles was selected for the plume exposure pathway and a radius of \nabout 50 miles was selected for the ingestion exposure pathway. \nAlthough the radius of the EPZ implies a circular area, the actual \nshape would depend upon the characteristics of a particular site. The \ncircular or other defined shape is assumed for planning purposes, \nwhereas necessary response would likely involve only a portion of the \ntotal area because of meteorological conditions at the time of the \naccident. For example, there is no danger of plume exposure upwind of \nthe site even within the 10-mile EPZ. Thus, in a particular emergency, \nprotective actions would most likely be restricted to a small part of \nthe planning zones.\n    The need for evacuation beyond a few miles from the plant is \nextremely unlikely. If protective actions were needed beyond 10 miles, \nthe action required would most likely be sheltering while the plume \npasses and then evacuation of relatively small areas based on the \namount of deposition of radioactive materials on the ground from the \npassing plume. The risk is highly concentrated near the nuclear plant. \nAlthough there is no line at 10 miles beyond which radiation cannot \npass, the hazard from an accident tends to decrease as one moves \nfurther from the plant. The Commission has concluded that beyond a \ndistance of 10 miles the hazard is small enough that specific detailed \nplanning for evacuation is not necessary."

What is the current Federal and \nlicensee program for conducting emergency planning exercises and drills \nat and around nuclear power plants, i.e., onsite and at 10 miles and 50 \nmiles?\n    Response. Emergency planning regulations currently require \nemergency planning exercises to be conducted onsite for the 10-mile \nplume exposure pathway EPZ every two years, and for the 50-mile \ningestion pathway EPZ with State involvement every six years, as \ndescribed below.\n    A full participation exercise, which tests as much of the licensee, \nState and local emergency plans as is reasonably achievable (without \nmandatory public participation), is conducted for each site. In such an \nexercise, appropriate offsite State and local authorities and licensee \npersonnel physically and actively take part in testing their integrated \ncapability to assess and respond adequately to a nuclear power plant \naccident. This exercise is conducted within 2 years prior to the \nissuance of the first operating license for full power (>5% power) and \nincludes participation by each State and local government within the \n10-mile plume exposure pathway EPZ and each State within the 50-mile \ningestion pathway EPZ.

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 11. In his testimony, Dr. Irwin Redlener questions why \naircraft are not forbidden to fly over nuclear plants. Since NRC has \nworked closely and extensively with NORAD and FAA on this very topic, \nwhat are the Commission's views on the practicality of excluding \nnuclear power plants, as well as other sensitive targets (sports \nstadiums, chemical facilities, tall buildings, etc.) from fly zones?\n    Response. On September 23, 2001, representatives of the Federal \nAviation Administration (FAA), Department of Defense (DoD), and NRC met \nto discuss aviation security. The FAA determined that an FAA Notice To \nAirmen (NOTAM) was the appropriate vehicle to advise pilots about the \nneed to avoid air space above sensitive sites, such as nuclear power \nplants. The NOTAM subsequently issued on September 26, 2001, and \nupdated by later NOTAMs, strongly urged pilots ``to not circle or \nloiter over the following sites: Nuclear/Electrical power plants, power \ndistribution stations, dams, reservoirs, refineries, or military \ninstallations, unless otherwise authorized by air traffic control or as \nrequired to land or depart at towered/non-towered airports.'' This \nnotice is still in effect.\n    Since September 11, 2001, nuclear plant licensees have reported \naircraft flying in close proximity to their facilities. On October 12, \n2001, the NRC formalized the process by issuing an advisory to \nlicensees which requested that they provide immediate reports of any \nflyovers to the FAA, FBI, local law enforcement agencies, and the NRC.\n    The NRC contends that the most effective means of ensuring \nprotection against attack by commercial aircraft is by interdiction at \nthe airport (through personnel and baggage screening), hardened cockpit \ndoors, support from the U.S. Air Marshal program, warning signals from \naircraft that a high-jacking is underway, etc.\n    No fly zones around nuclear power plants and other sensitive \ntargets are not practical as a matter of routine. Because of nuclear \npower plants' location in areas of dense air traffic, such as the \nnortheast corridor of the United States, such flight restrictions would \nsignificantly disrupt air travel. A 5- or 10-mile no fly zone would \nalso provide very little warning of attack, insufficient for a combat \nair patrol aircraft to respond unless it were already in the immediate \nvicinity."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 12. In his testimony, Dr. Irwin Redlener states that \nnuclear fuel rods are extremely vulnerable in the deep pools where they \nare currently stored. What are the Commission's views on the protection \nprovided by the pools from aircraft or ground assault?\n    Response. The Commission does not agree that spent fuel stored in \npools is ``extremely vulnerable''. The construction of the spent fuel \nstorage pools is robust. Spent fuel pool wall thicknesses typically \nexceed containment wall thicknesses and are frequently not exposed on \nthe exterior wall of the building in which they are housed. Although \nthe structures over spent fuel pools tend to be less robust than the \npools themselves, attacks that damage the overhead structure are not \nlikely to cause the pool water to drain down. In the highly unlikely \nevent that an attack caused structural debris to fall into the pool and \ndamage the stored fuel, the pool water would reduce the release of \nradioactive material to the environment. In addition, the location of \nsystem connections to the pools is designed to prevent uncovering spent \nfuel due to drain down if the connections should fail. Most pool drain-\ndown or heat-up scenarios develop slowly, thus providing time for \noperators to act to mitigate the event and prevent radiological \nrelease. As we stated in response to question 7, even if an attack \ncould somehow rapidly empty the pool, the much lower decay heat of the \nspent fuel in the pool would permit emergency cooling of the fuel using \nreadily available measures that could be accomplished without \nsignificant exposure of workers to radiation and would also provide \nadditional time to evacuate the area near the plant to prevent any \nimmediate fatalities."

With respect to potential terrorist attacks, we believe that \nthere is reasonable assurance that the health and safety of the public \nis protected against such attacks for both types of spent fuel storage. \nLicensees have implemented actions as a result of the NRC Orders and \nadvisories to protect against a potential terrorist attack. \nNonetheless, we are continuing to assess whether additional measures \nare needed to strengthen further the current capability to defend such \nstructures against terrorism.\n    NRC disagrees with the statement that ``nothing but costs prevent \nimmediate transfer of spent fuel rods to dry cask storage.'' There are \ntechnical issues associated with dry cask storage that need resolution \nbefore transfer of all spent fuel rods to dry cask storage is \npractical. The dry cask storage systems currently approved by NRC have \nnot been evaluated for all the different types of fuel currently stored \nin reactor pools. New spent fuel dry storage systems would need to be \ndesigned, and then evaluated and approved by NRC prior to their use. In \naddition, the current production capacity of dry cask storage system \nvendors is limited and time is needed to increase production capacity. \nFinally, in the case of a site specific license application, schedules \nmust allow for contested issues to be resolved through hearings prior \nto a licensing decision."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    On behalf of the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), it is my \npleasure to appear before the Committee and express our support for \nboth S. 1586 and S. 1746. We believe that these bills, if enacted, \nwould significantly reduce the risk of radiological sabotage by \nlessening the probability that attempted sabotage will be successful \nand by lessening the consequences should sabotage be successful despite \nall protective measures.\n    My name is David Lochbaum. After obtaining a degree in nuclear \nengineering from The University of Tennessee in 1979, I worked more \nthan 17 years in private industry, most of that time at operating \nnuclear power plants in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Kansas, New \nJersey, and Pennsylvania. I have been the Nuclear Safety Engineer for \nUCS since October 1996. UCS, established in 1969 as a non-profit, \npublic interest group, seeks to ensure that all people have clean air, \nenergy and transportation, as well as food that is produced in a safe \nand sustainable manner. UCS has worked on nuclear plant safety issues \nfor nearly 30 years.\n    Some representatives of the nuclear industry claim that nuclear \npower plants are such hardened structures as to be virtually immune \nfrom attack. Other industry representatives assert that even a \nsuccessful attack would not endanger the American public because \nradioactive material released from the sabotaged nuclear plant would so \ndiluted within 5 miles as to preclude the need for either sheltering or \nevacuation. There would be no need for the security upgrades specified \nin the proposed legislation if either of these claims were valid.\n    Compelling circumstantial evidence creates more than reasonable \ndoubt for the veracity of the industry's claims. Force-on-force tests \nof nuclear plant security administered by the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission (NRC) since 1991 consistently demonstrated security \ncapabilities below NRC's minimum expectations nearly half of the time. \nNuclear plants cannot be considered immune from attack when security \nforces, given up to 6 months advance warning of the precise test date, \nare unable to prevent simulated reactor core damage from a very, very \nsmall band of mock attackers. On at least two recent occasions, a \nsingle mock intruder successfully simulated the destruction of the \nequipment needed to cool the reactor. Nuclear plants cannot be \nconsidered immune from attack when security forces are unable to \nprevent a lone saboteur from triggering a reactor meltdown. In the past \n2 years, I have attended numerous NRC public meetings where industry \nrepresentatives contended that poor performance on a security test \nwould not have occurred had an armed guard not taken a wrong turn while \nrushing to his or her response position. Again, nuclear plants cannot \nbe considered immune from attack when a single mistake by a single \nguard means the difference between successful defense and reactor \nsabotage.\n    With respect to the potential consequences from the successful \nattack on a nuclear plant, the industry's actions speak much louder \nthan its rhetoric. If it were even close to being true that \nradioactivity releases would not endanger people living 5 miles or more \naway, then it would also be true that the nuclear power industry would \nnot need Federal liability protection. Representatives of the nuclear \npower industry testified before the Congress that the Price-Anderson \nAct needed to be renewed for existing plants and expanded to cover any \nnew nuclear plants that are built. The industry's need for Price-\nAnderson protection is an implicit concession that the offsite \nconsequences from a nuclear plant accident /attack could be extremely \nserious.\n    It is our steadfast position that U.S. nuclear plants are \nvulnerable to attack and that the consequences from a successful attack \ncould be dire. It is further our position that all reasonable measures \nmust be taken to lessen this risk. The proposed legislation in S. 1586 \nand S. 1746 represents reasonable steps that would reduce the \nprobability of a successful attack and reduce the consequences \nfollowing a successful attack. Thus, we support both bills and hope \nthey become law."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    While all provisions of both bills have merit, the most valuable \nportion of the proposed legislation is Section 4 of S. 1746 (the \nNuclear Security Act of 2001). This section would amend Section 204 of \nthe Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5844) to create an \nOperation Safeguards and Response Unit within the NRC. Subsection \n(d)(3)(B) of the amended act requires the NRC to conduct force-on-force \ntesting at each nuclear plant at least once every 2 years. Force-on-\nforce tests are the best measure of the integrated capability of \nsecurity fences, locked doors, intrusion detection equipment, access \ncontrol barriers, and armed guards to defend the plant from attempted \nsabotage. Absent such performance demonstrations, security must be \nevaluated via piece-meal audits of the various physical protection \nelements.\n    How do teachers evaluate their students' academic performance? Do \nthey use a checklist to verify that students attend classes with \ntextbooks, pencils, paper, and calculators? No, they use tests that \ndemonstrate their students' capabilities. Textbooks and class \nattendance are the pathway to knowledge while tests are the best \nmeasure of progress along that pathway. Likewise, security checklists \nshow that a nuclear plant has gates, guards, and guns, but they provide \nlittle insight on how far the plant has progressed along the pathway to \nadequate security. Force-on-force tests demonstrate whether the desired \nperformance objective of adequate security has been achieved. Frequent \ndemonstration of adequate security performance is invaluable.\n    The NRC initiated force-on-force testing in 1991. Due to resource \nconstraints, the NRC only tested each nuclear plant about once every 8 \nyears. UCS heard from many NRC staffers and nuclear plant workers that \nsecurity capabilities ramped up at some nuclear plants in advance of \nthe force-on-force tests and rapidly declined shortly afterwards. More \nfrequent testing levels out the peaks and valleys and assures more \nconsistent security capabilities.\n    Legislation directing the NRC to conduct frequent force-on-force \ntests ensures that the agency has the budget necessary to administer \nthe tests. In July 1998, resource allocation issues prompted the NRC to \ncancel force-on-force testing. The ensuing public outcry reversed the \nNRC's decision with testing re-instituted in fall 1998. This \nlegislation ensures that nuclear facility security tests are not \ndiscarded at the next budget crisis.\n    This legislation also ensures that testing of nuclear facility \nsecurity remains in the NRC's hands where it belongs. The nuclear \nindustry has been campaigning to conduct the security tests themselves \nand to evaluate their performance on the tests. Nuclear facility \nsecurity is too important to permit the equivalent of take-home tests \nthat are self-graded. The industry's consistently poor performance on \nsecurity tests since 1991 does not warrant self-assessment in this \nvital area.\n    The very nature of nuclear plant security does not lend itself to \nindustry self-assessment. The nuclear industry has successfully \nemployed self-assessment in other areas. For example, requalification \nof control room operators is conducted by plant owners subject to audit \nby the NRC. The standards employed by the plant owners and the audit \nreports issued by the NRC are all publicly available for perusal by \npeople living near the facility and by public-interest groups like UCS. \nIn addition, NRC inspection reports covering control room operator \nperformance during routine operations and during transient conditions \nare publicly available. This transparency makes it harder for self-\nassessments to cover up poor performance.\n    Conditions are significantly different when it comes to nuclear \nplant security. For obvious reasons, the public does not have the same \naccess to either security standards or NRC audit reports. This \nnecessary opaqueness makes it easier for self-assessment to cover up \npoor performance. The NRC must retain control over nuclear plant \nsecurity tests to protect the public against inadequate security being \nmasked by the self-assessment process.\n    Subsection (d)(3)(F) of the amended act requires the NRC to submit \nan annual report on force-on-force testing results to the Congress and \nthe President. This annual report facilitates oversight of this \nimportant public health issue. This report also provides the American \npublic with the ``big picture'' it deserves regarding nuclear facility \nsecurity. The anxiety level in America following 09/11 about potential \nvulnerabilities of nuclear facilities to terrorist attack would have \nbeen significantly lessened had the Federal Government been able to \npoint to the information in this annual report as tangible evidence of \nsecurity preparedness. People living near nuclear facilities that had \nperformed well on robust security tests conducted by NRC would take \ncomfort in that knowledge. People living near nuclear facilities that \nhad not performed so well on security tests would also benefit, albeit \nin a different way. Anxiety about abstract security concerns would be \nreplaced by more focused concerns. The ensuing discussions about \nactions taken to compensate for and correct problem areas would allay \nanxiety faster than press releases about hardened facilities and lack \nof credible threats against specific nuclear facilities.\n    Subsection (d)(4) of the amended act requires NRC in conjunction \nwith FEMA and other Federal, State, and local agencies to exercise \nresponse to a radiological emergency at each nuclear facility at least \nonce every 3 years. Appendix E to 10 CFR Part 50 currently requires a \nfull-scale exercise of the emergency response plan for each nuclear \npower plant at least once every 2 years. UCS believes that the key \ndifference between the existing requirement in Appendix E to 10 CFR \nPart 50 and the intent of subsection (d)(4) is emergency response to an \nact of radiological sabotage. The exercises conducted to satisfy 10 CFR \n50 Appendix E simulate nuclear accidents that cause releases of \nradioactivity to the air and water. The emergency response to \nradiological sabotage would be similar, but it might be more \ncomplicated. For example, Federal, State, and local resources might be \nmore challenged following a sabotage event because of the need to also \nprovide protection of other potential targets in the region. In \naddition, protective measures of securing bridges and tunnels might \nimpede evacuation efforts. Therefore, it seems prudent and reasonable \nto periodically assess whether emergency response plans for nuclear \nfacilities can also handle acts of sabotage."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    The second most valuable part of the proposed legislation is \nSection 3 of the Nuclear Security Act of 2001 which would amend Chapter \n14 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) to add \nSection 170C, ``Protection of Sensitive Nuclear Facilities Against the \nDesign Basis Threat.'' Subsection (c)(1) requires the NRC to revise the \ndesign basis threat from its 1960's-vintage level to a more realistic \nlevel. The current design basis threat was promulgated by the NRC \nnearly 40 years ago and has not been substantively changed other than \nthe addition of the vehicle bomb requirement in 1993/1994. Subsection \n(c)(1) requires the NRC, in consultation with the Assistant to the \nPresident for Homeland Security and other appropriate Federal, State, \nand local agencies to review the design basis threat every 3 years and \nrevise it as applicable. Subsection (c)(2) requires the NRC to report \nto Congress on changes made to the design basis threat. These \nprovisions ensure that he design basis threat remains at the \nGoldilocks' level--not too high, not too low, but just right.\n    Defining the design basis threat level appropriately is extremely \nimportant. The nuclear facility owner is responsible for protecting \nagainst an attack up to and including the design basis threat level. \nThe Federal Government is responsible for protecting the facility from \nlarger threats. This division of responsibility is both necessary and \npractical. The owner of a nuclear power plant situated along our coasts \ncannot be expected to defend the facility against an enemy destroyer \ncruising offshore. Likewise, the Federal Government cannot be expected \nto defend a privately owned nuclear power plant against sabotage by a \nhandful of individuals or a small group of plant workers.\n    The initial upgrade of the design basis threat is warranted. Left \nunchanged, the current design basis threat requires the Federal \nGovernment to protect Americans from radiological sabotage caused by as \nfew as four persons or two plant workers. It requires the Federal \nGovernment to protect nuclear plants from a truck bomb of the size used \nby Timothy McVeigh in Oklahoma City. It's unrealistic to expect that \nthe Federal Government could adequately defend against such a small \nattacking force.\n    Subsections (d)(2)(B)(iv) and (d)(2)(B)(v) explicitly require \nsecurity protection for spent fuel whether it is stored in wet-pools or \ndry casks. Highlighting the potential hazard from spent fuel, and the \ncorresponding need for its protection, is very important. Since 1991, \nOver 300 force-on-force exercises have been administered by NRC at U.S. \nnuclear power plants. None of those exercises ever tested the security \nprotection for spent fuel. We are not suggesting that the spent fuel \nhazard is equivalent to the reactor hazard; rather that the spent fuel \nhazard is not negligible and must be appropriately protected. Thus, it \nis beneficial that this proposed legislation clearly establishes that \nthe design basis threat applies to both the reactor and its spent fuel, \nthus making it more likely that both hazards will be adequately \nprotected."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Section 5 of the Nuclear Security Act of 2001 amends Section 170 of \nthe Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) to require stockpiling \nof potassium iodide for the population with a 50-mile radius around \neach nuclear facility. The amendment additionally requires distribution \nplans to be developed to get the potassium iodide to people as \nexpeditiously as possible in event of a nuclear accident/attack.\n    Potassium iodide does not provide immunity from all radioactivity \nthat could be released following a nuclear accident/attack, but it does \nprovide protection against thyroid damage caused by radioactive iodine \n(I-131). That potassium iodide has value is clearly demonstrated by the \nfact that it is distributed to nuclear plant workers and to Federal, \nState, and local personnel responding to the nuclear accident/attack. \nIt would seem imprudent public policy not to provide equivalent \nprotection for the innocent people living downwind of the facility.\n    According to the NRC, 13 states currently stockpile potassium \niodide for the people living within the emergency planning zone around \nnuclear power plants. The proposed legislation eliminates the inequity \nassociated with some Americans being protected while many other \nAmericans are not protected. The NRC protecting only some Americans \nmakes about as much sense as the U.S. Coast Guard requiring lifeboats \non only some cruise ships. Given its low cost and long shelf life, it \nwould seem exceedingly difficult for Federal, State, and local \nauthorities to assure American victims that everything had been done to \nprotect them from radiation if potassium iodide hadn't been stockpiled \nand distributed.\n    Consider the following hypothetical situation. State X has two \noperating nuclear power plants. Plant A is located in the northern part \nof the State while Plant B is in the southeastern corner of the state. \nState X has not stockpiled potassium iodide, while State Y on its \neastern border has done so. A serious accident at Plant B releases \nlarge amounts of radiation to the air necessitating both sheltering and \nevacuations. Residents in State Y living within the emergency planning \nzone are also provided potassium iodide. Residents in State X living \nwithin the emergency planning zone do not receive potassium iodide.\n    In all likelihood, the post-mortem for this accident would cause \npotassium iodide to be stockpiled in State X for the people within the \nemergency planning zone around Plant A. Federal and State X authorities \nwould have a very tough time explaining why the people in State Y \nreceived greater protection. Parents in State X will never know whether \ntheir children's thyroid illnesses might have been prevented had they \njust been given a dollar's worth of potassium iodide like their friends \nwith healthy kids over in State Y received. Enacting the proposed \nlegislation will prevent this hypothetical situation from becoming a \ntragic reality.\n    Expanding the potassium iodide inventory to cover a 50-mile radius \nrather than a 10-mile radius decreases the likelihood that affected \npeople will not be protected. No matter where the line is drawn, the \nquestion will remain about people living at N+1 miles. The 50-mile \nradius seems to be a reasonable compromise. Even if conditions affect \npeople 60 or 70 miles downwind, the 50-mile inventory makes it more \nlikely that potassium iodide can be redirected from people living 40- \nto 50-mile upwind to affected people downwind."

Subsection (b)(1) requires NRC to employ the \nnuclear security force at sensitive nuclear facilities. This provision \nis our least favorite part of the proposed legislation. Our concern is \nin having the NRC responsible both for providing security and for \nassessing whether security is adequate. It would seem to create at \nleast organizational tension if not an outright conflict-of-interest \nfor the NRC staff to do both.\n    Federalization of the nuclear security force provides gains to \noffset the conflict-of-interest concern. For example, subsection \n(e)(2)(A) requires the NRC to establish minimum qualification standards \nfor members of the nuclear security force. Currently, the qualification \nstandards for security personnel are established by the plant owners or \nthe companies they've contracted with for security. Consequently, \nthere's a very wide range of ``minimum'' qualification standards.\n    There is also a wide range of working conditions for security \nguards at nuclear plants. Security guards at some plants have told me \nabout good working conditions. They get fair compensation and benefits \nand receive good initial and follow-up training. They reported security \nstaffing levels sufficient to permit adequate coverage of all posts and \nto avoid fatigue associated with chronic overtime. Unfortunately, I \nhave also heard from security guards complaining about poor training, \ndefective equipment, insufficient staffing levels, low pay, lack of \nmedical benefits, and other factors contributing to bad morale. \nFederalization is unlikely to make all security guards content all the \ntime, but it should serve to narrow the gap between the guard forces at \nfacilities where management recognizes their importance and the guard \nforces at facilities where management views them as undesired financial \ndrains.\n    The periodic force-on-force testing conducted by the NRC as \nproposed in Section 4 of the Nuclear Security Act of 2001 could achieve \nthe same positive gain as would result from federalizing the nuclear \nsecurity force. Plant owners who currently undervalue their security \nguards would likely have to change that outlook in order to attain the \nrequired performance levels on the 2-year force-on-force tests."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","                  PROTECTION AGAINST INSIDER SABOTAGE"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    As detailed above, the proposed legislation contains many \nprovisions that individually and collectively improve nuclear facility \nsecurity. The only element potentially missing from the proposed \nlegislation is adequate protection against insider sabotage. Subsection \n(c)(1)(A)(iv) of the proposed amendment to Chapter 14 of the Atomic \nEnergy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) outlined in Section 3 of \nthe Nuclear Security Act of 2001 requires the NRC to revise the design \nbasis threat to include several nuclear workers assisting in an attack. \nSubsection (b)(2) requires the NRC to ``develop and implement a \nsecurity plan for each sensitive nuclear facility to ensure the \nsecurity of all sensitive nuclear facilities against the design basis \nthreat.'' UCS recommends that the Committee consider strengthening the \nproposed language by revising it to explicitly incorporate the \nfollowing items, obtaining a firm commitment from the NRC to include \nthese items as appropriate in the security plans, or providing clear \nguidance on expectations regarding these items in the Committee reports \naccompanying the bills:\n    <bullet> Two person rule for vital areas.--Authorized individuals \ntypically gain entry to vital areas within nuclear facilities using \ncomputerized access cards. An authorized individual could thus enter \nvital area(s) alone and tamper with safety equipment. Adoption of the \ntwo-person rule for vital area entry would eliminate the opportunity \nfor a single person acting alone to attempt sabotage.\n    <bullet> In-plant security cameras.--The majority of security \ncameras in use today at nuclear facilities protect against unauthorized \nintrusion to the site. Fewer security cameras are deployed inside the \nfacility to protect against sabotage. Installation of additional \nsecurity cameras within the nuclear facility would provide greater \nprotection against sabotage by workers.\n    <bullet> Security guard accompanying visitors in vital areas.--\nUnder certain conditions, a single authorized individual can escort \nfive visitors into vital areas without being accompanied by a security \nguard. These visitors have had no background investigations other than \na perfunctory check using the social security numbers they provide. The \npotential exists for an insider to arrange for the external attackers \nto enter the facility as visitors and then escort them into vital \nareas. Requiring all visitors into vital areas to be accompanied by a \nsecurity guard provides substantive protection against this threat.\n    <bullet> 50.59 screenings for insider sabotage.--10 CFR 50.59 \nrequires proposed modifications to nuclear facilities and planned \nchanges to procedures to be reviewed for possible erosion of safety \nmargins. Safety margin reductions must be approved in advance by the \nNRC. But these 50.59 screenings do not specifically require an \nevaluation of whether the changes provide insiders with greater \nopportunities for sabotage. For example, a temporary configuration \nduring a refueling outage may reduce response time to less than that \navailable when the plant is operating. The insider may elect to attempt \nsabotage during this vulnerable period. If this vulnerability was \nidentified, it would be possible to compensate for it by posting a \nsecurity guard by essential equipment during the temporary alignment. \nRequiring 50.59 screenings to explicitly assess insider sabotage \nprovides substantive protection against this threat.\n    <bullet> Compensation for longer testinglinspection intervals.--In \nrecent years, the NRC has allowed plant owners to lengthen the interval \nbetween tests and inspections of safety equipment. The reductions in \ntesting/inspection frequencies have been justified using actual \nexperience of component failure rates. Longer testing/inspection \nintervals-particularly when their schedules are readily available-\nprovide insiders with ample opportunities to plan and execute a \ncampaign of tampering with safety equipment over time with the aim of \ndisabling all mitigating and containment systems when sabotage is \nultimately attempted. These opportunities should be lessened by the NRC \n(a) recognizing that equipment tests and inspections also guard \nagainst-sabotage and therefore intervals must not be solely based on \nobserved failure rates, or (b) requiring random tests/inspections to be \nconducted if the intervals are solely based on observed failure rates.\n    <bullet> Providing operators with anti-sabotage training.--The \nNRC's Generic Fundamentals Examination Question Bank for boiling water \nreactor (BWR) operator license candidates has 959 pages of questions \nwhile the NRC's Generic Fundamentals Examination Question Bank for \npressurized water reactor (PWR) operator license candidates has 977 \npages of questions Not a single one of the literally hundreds of \nquestions directly deals with how to defend the plant from an insider \nattempting radiological sabotage. Operator candidates receive classroom \ninstruction and control room simulator training on how to cope with \npostulated pipe breaks, pump failures, and power outages. Licensed \noperators receive annual retraining on these subjects. Training \noperator candidates and licensed operators on how to respond to \nscenarios such as an insider attempting to take over the control room \nor an insider manipulating switches from the remote shutdown panel \nwould supplement the skills they develop to handle nonsabotage \nemergencies.\n    In summary, UCS supports both S. 1586 and S. 1746 and hope that \nboth bills become law. If only one part of the bills became law, we'd \nprefer that it be the part requiring the NRC to conduct force-on-force \nsecurity tests at each nuclear facility at least once every 2 years. If \nonly one part of the bills didn't become law, we'd least miss the part \nfederalizing the nuclear security forces."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 1. In your testimony, you stated that you thought ``the \nmost valuable portion of the proposed legislation is Section 4'' to \ncreate on Operation Safeguards and Response Unit within the NRC. Can \nyou please comment on Chairman Meserve's testimony, which indicated \nthat this aspect of the legislation has already been accomplished and \nis therefore unnecessary?\n    Response. On April 7, 2002, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nestablished an Office of Nuclear Security and Incident Response to \nconsolidate the agency's efforts for nuclear facility security. This \noffice is in many ways superior to the Operation Safeguards and \nResponse Unit described in the proposed legislation. For example, it \nreports at a more senior level within the NRC than was proposed for the \nOperation Safeguards and Response Unit. However, we disagree with \nChairman Meserve that the objective of the proposed legislation has \nalready been accomplished. The proposed legislation in Section 4 of the \nNuclear Security Act did not merely shuffle and rename bureaucratic \npieces. It charged the Operation Safeguards and Response Unit with \nperforming force-on-force security exercises at all nuclear facilities \nunder NRC's purview at least once every 2 years. The newly established \nOffice of Nuclear Security and Incident Response would conduct these \nsecurity exercises, but the NRC did not require it to conduct exercises \nat all, let alone once every 2 years. Thus, the actions taken by the \nNRC on April 7th were a step in the right direction, but they remain \nseveral steps shy of the destination. The proposed legislation in \nSection 4 will move the agency the remaining steps. Absent this \nlegislation, those steps might not be taken."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 2. In your testimony, you talked about NRC's resource \nconstraints, which apparently inhibited the Commission's ability to run \nforce-on-force exercises at the plants. Can you provide more detail on \nthis issue and explain how the legislation we are considering today \naddresses that issue?\n    Response. In June 1998, the Senate Appropriations Committee \nsuggested that it would cut the NRC's budget by approximately 40 \npercent. In the ensuing discussions regarding this suggestion, the \nbudget cut was scaled back to a much more modest reduction. The \nAppropriations bill authorizing the NRC's budget required the agency to \nreport monthly to the Congress on its progress in handling specific \nactivities. For example, the NRC reported on goals of completing 95 \npercent of all license amendment applications within 1 year and 100 \npercent of all such applications within 2 years. The NRC did not want \nto miss goals it was reporting to Congress each month. Therefore, the \nagency reallocated staff so as to provide greater assurance that these \ntasks would be completed on time. The NRC was not required to report to \nCongress on its progress in other areas, such as how often it tested \nnuclear plant security. Thus, the aforementioned staff reassignments \nwere from non-reported areas to reported areas. In July 1998, the NRC's \nDirector of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation canceled the \nforce-on-force security testing program that the agency had been \nconducting since 1991. This cancellation was part of the staff \nreassignments made following the June 1998 budget debates.\n    The proposed legislation would address the problem by providing the \nNRC with a mandate to conduct force-on-force security tests at all \nnuclear facilities at least once every 2 years. The NRC would have to \nrequest in its annual budget sufficient funding to accomplish this \nmandate."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 3. You and others today have expressed concerns about \nfederalizing security at our Nation's nuclear power plants, but you \nhave also indicated that there are certain threats against which plants \ncannot be expected to defend as has the NRC. So how do we best provide \nseam-less security at these facilities?\n    Response. UCS views the Design Basis Threat (DBT) as the line \nbetween the threat level that individual plant owners must defend \nagainst and the larger threat level that the Federal Government is \nexpected to defend against. The best way to provide seam-less security \nwould be to require the NRC to promulgate regulations analogous to \nthose in Appendix E to Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The \nNRC promulgated Appendix E to require all nuclear plant owners to have \nan emergency plan in case of accidents. The regulations include \nprovisions for periodically testing the emergency plan with exercises \ninvolving local, state, and Federal agencies. Collectively, these \nregulations help assure that all of the entities that would need to \nfunction following a nuclear plant accident have procedures in place \nalong with adequate training. During the hearing on June 5th, the \nCommittee heard testimony praising the effectiveness of emergency \nplanning.\n    Comparable regulations could require nuclear plant owners to have \nformal plans in case of larger than DBT attacks. Periodic exercises of \nthe plans would enable U.S. military, State National Guardsmen, local \nlaw enforcement, U.S. Coast Guard, and other entities to demonstrate \ntheir proficiencies. As in the case of emergency planning, it would \nseem most appropriate for the NRC to be responsible for bringing these \nvarious authorities together to ensure adequate nuclear plant security. \nIf it promulgated comparable regulations, the NRC would be positioned \nto assure that plant owners could defend against threats up to and \nincluding the DBT and that other entities could defend against larger \nthreats."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 4. In your testimony, you indicate that the qualification \nstandards for security personnel are established by the plant owners or \nthe companies that the have contracted with for security resulting in a \nwide range of minimum qualification standards. Is this something that \nneeds to be addressed and if so, how? In your opinion, does the \nlegislation being considered today address this issue?\n    Response. We believe that the proposed legislation does address the \nconcern about diverse qualification standards. The force-on-force \nsecurity tests conducted at least once every 2 years as specified in \nSection 4 of the Nuclear Security Act represent a performance standard \nthat is superior to minimum qualification standards. Poor performance \non the security tests would require plant owners to fix the problems, \neither by upgrading the caliber of security guards or by increasing the \nsecurity guard staffing levels to compensate for qualification \nshortfalls. With respect to public health and safety, either option is \nacceptable as long as adequate overall performance is demonstrated by \nthe force-on-force testing."

In your opinion, what do \nyou think the value of making the changes public will have?\n    Response. UCS did not envision the NRC's report to Congress being \npublicly available. Congress receives information from other agencies \nthat is not made public. We thought this report would also be treated \nconfidentially.

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 3.

Some of the security personnel have \ntold us they are pleased with their labor contacts and are apprehensive \nabout ``trading down'' if federalization occurred. But most of the \nsecurity personnel we have talked with complain about low wages, poor \nhealth plans, insufficient training, and long working hours. They \nconsider federalization was one way, but not the only way, to remedy \nunsatisfactory working conditions.\n    As noted in our written testimony, if one part of the proposed \nlegislation was not enacted, we'd hope it was the federalization part. \nIf the force-on-force security testing part was enacted, we believe it \nwould cause those plant owners who may be currently undervaluing their \nsecurity personnel to remedy any unsatisfactory working conditions."

Exelon \nGeneration currently owns and operates approximately 37,000 megawatts \nof diversified electrical generation, including 17 nuclear reactors \nthat generate 16,970 megawatts of electricity. Exelon is the largest \nnuclear generation operator in the country with approximately 20 \npercent of the nation's nuclear generation capacity, and the third \nlargest private nuclear operator in the world. We also own 50 percent \nof AmerGen Energy, which is a partnership with British Energy of \nEdinburgh, Scotland. AmerGen owns 3 of the 17 units in the Exelon \nfleet, with plants in Illinois, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\n    Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss \nlegislative proposals addressing several important security issues at \ncommercial nuclear power plants.\n    I would also thank several members of the committee for their \nefforts to investigate the issue of nuclear plant security first-hand. \nSenators Graham, Clinton, Corzine, Smith, Voinovich and Specter have \nall toured nuclear power plants to receive briefings on plant security \nsince September 11, as have several of the committee's staff members. \nIn fact, Senator Specter has toured three of the five nuclear power \nplants in Pennsylvania, including two Exelon facilities.\n    My testimony today will focus on three areas:\n    First, I will address legislative proposals pending before the \nSenate on nuclear plant security.\n    Second, I will provide the Committee with an overview of nuclear \nplant security.\n    Third, I will provide the Committee with recommendations regarding \nactions the Federal Government can take to address nuclear plant \nsecurity issues in the post-September 11th environment.\n    Before addressing these issues, however, let me make a few \npreliminary comments.\n    Let me begin by assuring the Committee that the nuclear power \nindustry is absolutely committed to ensuring that our plants are \noperated safely and that all necessary steps are taken to protect the \nhealth and safety of the public and our employees. No one has a greater \ninterest in protecting the safety and security of nuclear plants than \nthe owners and operators of those facilities.\n    In addition, it is important for the Committee to understand that \ncommercial nuclear power plants are the most well-protected industrial \nfacilities in the United States today. In fact, many businesses are \nturning to the nuclear industry as a model for providing security and \nemergency planning at their industrial complexes.\n    Finally, as the United States acts to strengthen homeland security \nin light of new threats to the nation's security, it is imperative that \nFederal, State, and local officials work cooperatively with nuclear \nplant operators to buildupon the solid foundation of emergency response \ncapabilities that existed prior to September 11th."

My comments will address \nthese bills, as well as H.R. 2983, legislation to reauthorize the \nPrice-Anderson Act of 1954, which was passed by the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and which is awaiting action by the Senate.\nS. 1586\n    S. 1586, introduced by Senator Jim Inhofe, amends the Atomic Energy \nAct to authorize NRC licensee employees to carry firearms, provides \nlimited arrest authority to such employees, and establishes a fine or \nimprisonment for the sabotage of commercial nuclear facilities. These \nprovisions were submitted to Congress by the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission several years ago and were approved by the Senate during the \n106th Congress as part of S. 1627, the NRC Fairness in Funding Act of \n2000, and as part of separate appropriations legislation.\n    The nuclear industry testified in support of the provisions as part \nof its testimony on S. 1627 during the 106th Congress, though some NRC \nlicensees have recently expressed concern about the possible legal \nimplications of providing wide-ranging arrest authority to private \nsecurity forces.

Unfortunately, S. 1746 puts \nthe proverbial cart before the horse by mandating radical legislative \nsolutions to issues that have not been identified as problems.\n    Section 3 would substitute a statutorily mandated design basis \nthreat for that developed by the independent Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission and would federalize security at commercial nuclear power \nplants by establishing a nuclear security force within the NRC and by \nrequiring the Commission to develop a security plan for each of the \nnation's sensitive nuclear facilities. Section 3 also levies a tax on \nsensitive nuclear facilities to fund a newly created Nuclear Security \nFund within the Treasury to pay for these massive and sweeping new \nFederal responsibilities.\n    Exelon is concerned about the imposition of a statutorily mandated \ndesign basis threat which prejudges the nature of the design basis \nthreat without a comprehensive review by the NRC in conjunction with \nFederal intelligence and law enforcement agencies. If legislative \naction in this area is deemed necessary, Congress should first direct \nthe President to conduct a comprehensive review with the various \nenergy, intelligence and law enforcement agencies of the various \nthreats facing nuclear power plants. Once such a review is completed, \nthe NRC should be directed to adjust the design basis threat \naccordingly.\n    With regard to federalization of nuclear plant security forces, \nExelon strongly opposes such a drastic and unjustified change in \nsecurity requirements. Security forces at nuclear power plants are \nhighly trained professionals. Substituting Federal employees to \nsafeguard sensitive nuclear facilities may actually degrade security. \nThe background check requirements, hiring qualifications, and training \nstandards in the bill are actually less stringent than those currently \nenforced by the NRC.\n    Federalizing the nuclear security forces would also eliminate some \nof the best candidates for nuclear security forces by effectively \nbarring recipients of Federal pensions from serving as Federal \nemployees. Some of the current members of nuclear security forces are \nmilitary retirees who would be forced to choose between resigning their \nposition or giving up their Federal pensions. In addition, nuclear \npower plant security forces work in an integrated manner with plant \noperators during a security event to coordinate responses to security \nthreats. Integrated command and control of plant security forces and \nplant operations personnel is essential to assure the protection of \npublic health and safety. Finally, federalizing nuclear security forces \nwould fundamentally change the mission of the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission. Hiring, training, and managing a security force of 7,000 \nemployees would be a massive undertaking and might well detract from \nthe Commission's core mission of assuring that plants are operated in a \nmanner that protects the public health and safety. It also places the \nNRC in an active role in day to day operations at the nation's nuclear \npower plants--a dramatic reversal of the efforts the Congress, the \nexecutive branch, the Commission, and the industry have made over the \npast 30 years to ensure the NRC is a regulator, not an operator.\n    Similarly, requiring the NRC to develop security plans for each of \nthe nation's sensitive nuclear facilities within 180 days would be a \nsignificant task that would result in an unnecessary--and perhaps \ndangerous--diversion of Commission resources. The NRC currently has \ndetailed regulations governing security requirements at plants, and \nplant personnel can best handle the coordination of plant security \nforces with State and local law enforcement officials. As with \nfederalization of nuclear plant security forces, requiring a federally \ndeveloped security plan for several dozen sites is unnecessary given \nthe complete lack of evidence that the current system is deficient.\n    Finally, a tax on nuclear plant operators would fund a new and \nunnecessary Federal bureaucracy and would be unparalleled in the \nprivate sector. Simply put, the tax would fund an activity that is \ncurrently being effectively managed by the private industry. In \naddition, the tax potentially would force nuclear power plant customers \nto inappropriately fund national defense activities and would likely \nresult in some nuclear plants subsidizing the cost of security at other \nplants.\n    Section 4 establishes an Operation Safeguards and Response Unit at \nthe NRC. The existing NRC Operational Safeguards and Response \nEvaluations (OSRE) program has been applied and interpreted in an \ninconsistent and at times arbitrary manner. Anti-nuclear groups and the \nNRC have at times inaccurately characterized licensee performance under \nthe existing OSRE program by claiming that licensees have ``failed'' a \nsignificant portion of force-on-force drills.\n    It is important to note that the OSRE program evaluates plant \nsecurity, and not plant safety. Given the ability of plant operators to \nsafely shut down an operating reactor in a matter of seconds, OSRE \ndrills alone are not an accurate reflection of plant safety.\n    The NRC has been striving to develop a more objective methodology \nfor determining the ability of nuclear plants to respond to design \nbasis threats. The program would potentially result in more frequent \nforce on force drills than in the past. The Commission has also moved \nto enhance its organizational structure with respect to security by \ncreating a new office dealing with security policies and programs.\n    Senator Reid's legislation seeks to address problems with the \ncurrent program by mandating a highly prescriptive program that could \nprevent the Commission from establishing amore effective and more \nappropriate program to evaluate the performance of plant security \nforces.\n    Section 4 also inappropriately expands the emergency planning zone \naround sensitive nuclear facilities from a 10-mile radius to a 50-mile \nradius. There has been no evidence to suggest that such a radical \nchange in the current regulatory system is warranted to protect public \nhealth and safety. Extending the 10-mile emergency planning zone to a \n50-mile radius would require planners to address an area of 7,857 \nsquare miles (as opposed to the current emergency planning zone which \nencompasses 315 square miles). Such an expansion would only serve to \ndiffuse the resources available to and distract the personnel \nresponsible for emergency planning from focusing on enhancing planning \nthat may have been ignored in other sectors prior to 9/11 and from \ncontinuing to ensure current planning is satisfactory. Again, absent \ncompelling evidence on the need to undertake such a massive effort, \nCongress should defer to the NRC, FEMA, and EPA in determining the \nappropriate radius for emergency planning purposes.\n    Section 5 directs the Commission to establish a stockpile of \npotassium iodide tablets and to develop plans for the prompt \ndistribution of potassium iodide tablets within a 50-mile radius of all \nsensitive nuclear facilities; The NRC, in conjunction with the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the Department of Health and Human \nServices, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has recommended \nthat potassium iodide be made available at the request of State \ngovernments for distribution within the 10-mile emergency planning zone \naround commercial nuclear power plants. There is no scientific basis \nfor expanding the distribution of potassium iodide to an area within 50 \nmiles of a sensitive nuclear facility.\n    Section 6 of the legislation directs the Commission to request \nassistance from Governors and the President in the event of war or \nother national emergency. While such assistance may be appropriate in \nthe event of war or other national emergency, the Commission is not \nbarred under current law from requesting such assistance. In addition, \nas the Commission stated in its review of the legislation, such \nassistance may not be appropriate in all circumstances and could divert \nresources from more vulnerable parts of the nation's infrastructure.\nH.R. 2983\n    H.R. 2983, which was passed by the U.S. House by voice vote last \nyear, includes an amendment by Representative Ed Markey to address the \nnuclear security issue. Under the Markey amendment, the President is \ndirected to conduct a study to identify the types of threats that pose \nan appreciable risk to NRC licensed facilities. The legislation \nincludes a number of issues to be considered during this study, \nincluding each of the issues enumerated in Section 3 of S. 1746. The \nPresident is also required to classify each type of threat as being the \nresponsibility of the Federal Government or of NRC licensees.\n    Exelon strongly supports the Markey amendment as an appropriate \nfirst step in identifying what additional changes maybe necessary to \nprotect commercial nuclear facilities in he aftermath of September \n11th. The amendment allows the White House to tap all Federal \nintelligence and law enforcement resources to assess the nature of the \nthreats that are faced by commercial nuclear facilities. The amendment \nalso directs the White House to clearly delineate between threats \nagainst which licensees must defend and threats against which law \nenforcement officials and the Federal Government must defend. Only \nafter such an assessment is conducted can Congress make a well-informed \ndecision regarding what additional resources and requirements are \nnecessary to protect commercial nuclear facilities."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Protection of public health and safety requires both the safe \noperation of nuclear plants and the physical protection of the plant \nagainst potential threats.\n    The industry today is operating the nation's 103 nuclear reactors \nmore efficiently and safely than ever before. The average capacity \nfactor for nuclear plants reached an all-time high of 91 percent in \n2001 according to preliminary data from the Nuclear Energy Institute, \nwhile the industrial safety accident rate for nuclear plants in 2000 \nwas a record-low 0.26, compared to an average accident rate in the \nmanufacturing sector of 4.0.\n    As another measure of safety, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nmonitors the number of ``significant events'' at each nuclear reactor \n(broadly defines as occurrences that challenge a plant safety system). \nThe average number of significant events per unit has declined from \n2.37 per year in 1985 to 0.03 per year in 2000, the latest year for \nwhich data is available.\n    Nuclear power today provides 20 percent of the nation's electricity \neach year, and it does so without emitting any of the pollutants \nassociated with acid rain or global warming. In fact, nuclear power has \nplayed a major role in allowing many regions of the country come into \ncompliance with Clean Air Act requirements.\n    The industry's commitment to safety also extends to plant security. \nIn fact, commercial nuclear power plants are regarded by many to be the \nmost well protected industrial facilities in the United States today. \nIndeed, many other industries are turning to the nuclear industry as a \nmodel for providing security at a variety of commercial facilities. For \nexample, in addition to unique physical protections employed at \ncommercial nuclear facilities, the nuclear industry is alone among \ncritical infrastructure industries in using the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigations to run criminal background checks on applicants for \npositions at sensitive facilities."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","Current Law\n    Existing Federal statutes and regulations provide strict standards \nrequiring licensees to take actions necessary to protect the public \nhealth and safety. NRC requirements and industry programs are \npredicated on the need to protect the public from the possibility of \nexposure to radioactive release caused by acts of sabotage.\n    The current design basis threat--the threat against which a plant \nlicensee must be able to protect--assumes a suicidal, well-trained \nparamilitary force, armed with automatic weapons and explosives, that \nis intent on forcing its way into a nuclear power plant to commit \nradiological sabotage. The design basis threat also assumes that the \nattackers will have insider knowledge of plant systems and plant \nsecurity plans and even insider assistance.\n    This assumed threat forms the basis for security response plans and \ntraining drills. These plans and drills are tested regularly by the NRC \nas part of their Operational Safeguards Response Evaluation (OSRE). The \nOSRE program has also provided the industry with the opportunity to \nidentify areas where security can be improved and enhanced."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","Physical Design of Plants\n    A number of defenses exist to counter such a threat. Nuclear \nplants, by their very design, provide a redundant set of physical \nbarriers designed both to keep radiation and radioactive materials \ninside the plant and to keep intruders outside' the plant. The reactor \ncore is protected by a containment structure comprised of several feet \nof thick reinforced concrete walls, a steel liner, additional concrete \nwalls within containment, and a several inches-thick high tensile steel \nreactor vessel. The metal cladding on the fuel itself also serves as an \nadditional protective barrier. In addition, there are multiple systems \nof the safety equipment needed to safely shut down the reactor. This \n``defense in depth'' design explains why the FBI considers nuclear \nplants to be ``hardened targets.''\n    Nuclear plant sites have three distinct zones, each of which has \ndifferent levels of physical and human defenses. The first zone, called \nthe ``owner-controlled area,'' includes all of the property that is \nassociated with the plant. The owner controlled area typically ranges \nin size from several dozen to hundreds of acres of land and serves as \nan effective buffer zone around the critical areas of the plant.\n    The second zone, the ``protected area,'' is a physically enclosed \narea' surrounding the plant into which access in controlled. Physical \nbarriers to intrusion include barbed wire and razor' wire fences, \nmicrowave and electronic intrusion detection systems, closed circuit \ntelevision systems, isolation zones, extensive lighting, system \nmonitoring by redundant alarm stations, and vehicle barrier systems. \nAccess to the protected area is restricted to a select population of \nsite personnel with a need for entry.\n    To access the protected area, plant employees and visitors must \npass through a metal detector and an explosives detector. X-ray \nmachines are also used to screen material brought into the protected \narea by employees and visitors. In addition, employees must utilize a \nhand-geometry device to confirm their identity before entering the \nprotected area.\n    The third zone, the ``vital area,'' includes those areas within the \nprotected area containing equipment essential for operating the plant \nsafely and successfully shutting, down in the case of an event. \nAdditional barriers are in place to protect vital areas of the plant; \nincluding concrete floors, walls, and ceilings; steel locked and \nalarmed doors; and key card access doors. Access to the vital area is \neven further restricted to a select population of site personnel with a \nneed for entry. These access lists are routinely reviewed to confirm \nthe need for access. The defensive contingency plans used by security \nforces are geared toward protection of these critical areas:"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","Security Forces\n    In addition to the robust physical structures protecting the plant, \nlicensees maintain a highly trained, well-equipped security force to \nguard each facility. Security personnel, many of whom have law \nenforcement or military experience, must undergo extensive background \nchecks, including fingerprint submittal for an FBI criminal record \ncheck; physical and psychological testing and screening; credit and \nreference checks; education and work history verification; and routine \ndrug and alcohol screening. The nuclear industry is unique among energy \nindustries in having a cooperative relationship with the FBI to \nfacilitate such criminal record checks.\n    In addition, security personnel are subject to rigorous training \nrequirements. Initial nuclear security officer training includes a wide \nvariety of topics, including NRC requirements for nuclear--facility \nphysical security, recognition of sabotage devices and equipment, \ncontraband detection devices and operation, firearms training and \ntactical response training. Annual supplemental training covers areas \nsuch as weapons proficiency, physical readiness, stress fire course, \nforce-on-force drills, and table top drills. A significant amount of \nannual training focuses on force-on-force training, which covers such \ntopics as threat assessment and tactical response, response force \ndeployment and interdiction, protection of specified vital equipment \nand protected areas, multiple target acquisition and engagement, and \nthe use of armored body bunkers, ballistic shields, and other \nspecialized security equipment.\n    As a further protection to the public, each nuclear power plant has \nan extensive and well-honed emergency response organization and systems \nin place to respond to and mitigate any emergency that arises. \nEmergency response plans are tightly integrated with local, State and \nFederal regulatory and emergency authorities and undergo regular \ntraining and drilling. The emergency planning zone includes an area \nwithin a 10-mile radius of the plant, an area encompassing roughly 315 \nsquare miles. Since September 11, Exelon Nuclear has conducted security \nbriefings for State and local officials in each of the States in which \nwe operate to reinforce the coordination and response plans in the \nevent of an emergency."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","September 11 and Its Aftermath\n    Upon notification by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on September \n11, all nuclear plants immediately increased their security to Level 3, \nthe highest level of security maintained at commercial nuclear \nreactors. All U.S. commercial reactors remain at Level 3.\n    Since September 11, nuclear plants have also extended the point of \ninitial screening of people entering the plant site from the protected \narea boundary to a point in the owner controlled area boundary. This \ninitial screening includes an identification check, confirmation of the \npurpose for entering the site, and a thorough vehicle inspection for \nall visitors. State police and, in some cases the National Guard, have \naugmented this effort. In addition, armed patrols have extended their \npatrols to include a larger portion of the owner-controlled area. These \npatrols are coordinated with onsite personnel to enhance detection and \ndeter potential threats.\n    Given the uncertain nature of potential attacks, Exelon Nuclear and \nother reactor operators took a variety or protective measures in \nconjunction with NRC guidance. These included actions to harden site \naccess, increase security resources, and improve operational readiness.\n    To harden site access, Exelon has: established armed owner control \narea checkpoints for all vehicles entering the site; implemented \nadditional vehicle pre-screening and control of all onsite deliveries \nupon entry to the owner-controlled area; positioned barriers to prevent \naccess at alternate Owner Controlled Area entrances; restricted visitor \naccess to those required for essential plant work; extended background \nchecks for all personnel with temporary unescorted access; checked \nemployee data bases against FBI watch lists of suspected terrorists \nfrom all known terrorist organizations.\n    To increase security resources, Exelon has: increased the number of \nsecurity officers; procured additional weapons and upgraded armaments; \nadded armed security posts at key plant locations; increased the \nsecurity presence at each site entrance; added local law enforcement, \nand at times National Guard, posted at site entrances.\n    To enhance operational readiness, Exelon has: enhanced plant \nprocedures and operator training for use during an attack or credible \nthreat; implemented a fleet-wide threat assessment procedure to respond \nto threat situations; elevated attention to security and fire \nprotection related equipment; established protocol for augmented \nFederal and State law enforcement assistance and intervention.\n    Since shortly after September 11, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nhas been engaged in a top-to-bottom review of the Design Basis Threat \nto reevaluate its adequacy. As an interim measure, the Commission \nissued Orders on February 25th of that year which imposes significant \nadditional requirements on licensees pending the completion of a more \ncomprehensive review of safeguards and security program requirements.\n    While many of the specifics regarding the NRC Orders are classified \nas safeguards information and cannot be disclosed to the public, issues \naddressed by the Orders include security officer staffing levels, \nprotection against potential vehicle and waterborne threats, protection \nof used fuel, enhanced access authorization controls, and mitigation \nefforts in the event of an attack."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    As the United States acts to strengthen homeland defense in light \nof new threats to the nation's security, it is imperative that Federal, \nState, and local officials work cooperatively with nuclear plant \noperators to buildupon the solid foundation of emergency response \ncapability that existed prior to September 11.\n    In particular, there are several steps that we believe the Federal \nGovernment should take to address security issues at nuclear power \nplants.\n    <bullet> There must be a clearer delineation of responsibility \nbetween government and plant licensees. Federal law currently requires \nNRC licensees to protect against a variety of potential threats to \ncommercial nuclear power plants, but the law also considers many \nthreats to be outside the scope of licensee responsibility and instead \nrelies on law enforcement agencies and the military to protect against \ncertain threats. Congress and the Administration must determine where \nthe line between licensee and government responsibility lies in light \nof the new threats faced by nuclear power plants and other facilities \nthat make up the nation's critical energy infrastructure.\n    <bullet> There must be improved communication and coordination \namong licensees and the various Federal, State and local agencies \ninvolved in emergency response planning. The Federal Government has a \nrole in financially supporting many of the actions necessary to \naccommodate this improved communication and coordination.\n    <bullet> The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has incurred--and will \ncontinue to incur--additional costs to address new security concerns. \nCongress should support the NRC's request for additional funding to \nsupport additional actions undertaken in support of homeland defense.\n    <bullet> The Nuclear Regulatory Commission should revise its \nprotocol of threat levels to conform with that used by the Office of \nHomeland Security.\n    <bullet> In determining the resources necessary to protect nuclear \npower plants, the Federal Government should consider the potential \nvulnerability of these plants relative to other potential critical \ninfrastructure targets and allocate limited Federal resources to those \nfacilities deemed to be most vulnerable to terrorist attack."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","Delineation of Government and Licensee Responsibility\n    The most pressing challenge facing Congress and other Federal \npolicymakers is ow to allocate responsibility for protecting the \nnation's critical infrastructure against attacks by terrorists and \nother enemies of the state. Federal law currently requires Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission (NRC) licensees to protect against a variety of \npotential threats to commercial nuclear power plants. Federal law \nconsiders many potential threats to be outside the scope of licensee \nresponsibility and instead relies on law enforcement agencies and the \nmilitary to protect against certain threats. The question facing \nCongress and the Administration is where the line between licensee and \ngovernment responsibility lies in light of the new threats faced by \nnuclear power plants and other facilities that make up the nation's \ncritical energy infrastructure.\n    The events of September 11 have presented the Nation with a variety \nof new challenges. Protection of the country's critical infrastructure \nis among the most important of these challenges, but it is a challenge \nthat I am confident the nuclear energy industry can and will continue \nto meet.\n    Exelon Nuclear fully supports the NBC's efforts to conduct a top-\nto-bottom review of security requirements pertaining to nuclear \nfacilities. We continue to assess security at our plants and have taken \nappropriate steps to increase security measures as a result of the \nheightened State of alert.\n    As Congress and the Administration debate what changes in Federal \nlaw and policies are appropriate in the aftermath of the September 11 \nattacks, strong consideration should be given to building upon the \nexisting regulatory system which distinguishes between threats for \nwhich licensees are responsible and threats for which law enforcement \nand the military are responsible.\n    As I mentioned earlier in my testimony, the House of \nRepresentatives endorsed one such approach last year as part of H.R. \n2983, the Price-Anderson Amendments Act, which passed by the House by \nvoice vote. The House legislation directs the President to conduct an \nassessment of potential threats against nuclear facilities and to \nclassify each threat as one for which the Federal Government should be \nresponsible or as one for which NRC licensees should be responsible The \nmeasure also requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to promulgate a \nrulemaking to ensure that licensees address the threats identified in \nthe report as a licensee responsibility.\n    Exelon strongly supports the Price-Anderson provisions as a \nreasoned approach to this very important issue. The Presidential study \nwill allow the White House to coordinate the efforts of a number of \nFederal agencies to conduct a comprehensive threat assessment. Such an \napproach will also allow personnel knowledgeable in security matters to \nmake decisions in coordination with intelligence officials to ensure \nthat nuclear facilities are treated in a manner consistent with the \nprotection of other critical infrastructure facilities."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","Improved Communication and Coordination\n    The need for improved communication and coordination among \nlicensees and Federal, State and local government agencies is perhaps \nbest illustrated by an event at AmerGen's Three Mile Island (TMI) plant \nlast year. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission notified AmerGen on \nOctober 17, 2001, that the Federal Government had received information \nthat it believed constituted a credible threat against the plant. A \nnumber of Federal agencies and organizations, including the NRC, the \nFBI, the FAA, and NORAD, were involved in the subsequent response to \nwhat was later determined not to be a credible threat.\n    Site personnel took immediate action to secure the plant, which was \nin the midst of a maintenance and refueling outage. The company also \nrequested--and received--additional security assistance from the \nPennsylvania State Police.\n    The ``threat'' against Three Mile Island showed that the regulatory \nsystem currently in place can work effectively in response to a \npotential threat. As the licensee, AmerGen took immediate action to \nsecure the site physically and called in additional assistance from the \nlaw enforcement community, while the Federal Government and the \nmilitary took action to protect the plant against potential threats \nthat fell outside the design basis threat against which AmerGen is \nresponsible for defending.\n    At the same time, the TMI event also provided both the industry and \nthe government with some valuable ``lessons learned,'' including the \nneed to work more closely with Federal officials to clarify the nature \nof threat information, the need to develop coordination procedures with \nmultiple Federal agencies, and the need to communicate effectively with \nlocal elected officials and emergency services personnel.\n    The Commission took a step toward addressing some of these issues \nearlier this year when it established an Office of Nuclear Security and \nIncident Response to consolidate and streamline selected NRC security, \nsafeguards, and incident response responsibilities and resources. While \nthis should address some coordination and communications issues, other \nFederal agencies must engage in similar efforts.\n    Finally, it is important that the NRC be integrated into the \nintelligence community's process for assessing and communicating \npotential threats against commercial nuclear facilities and other NRC \nlicensees. Nuclear plant licensees are highly dependent on receiving \nthreat information from the NRC, so it is essential that the Commission \nitself be fully integrated into the intelligence community's threat \nassessment process."

Each of the nation's 103 reactors have been at \nthe top level, Level 3, since September 11 and the Commission has \nindicated that plants will remain at Level 3 for the foreseeable \nfuture. This situation begs the question of how meaningful the \ndifferent security classifications are if the highest level of alert \neffectively becomes the only level of security. Given these concerns \nand the need for consistency in communicating the urgency of potential \nthreats, the Commission should revise its protocol of security levels \nto conform to the five level classification system established by the \nOffice of Homeland Security. Such a system would also allow the \nCommission and licensees to distinguish between the current generalized \nheightened State of alert and a more specific threat against a plant or \nplants.\n    As the NRC develops a new security level classification; it should \nestablish security requirements that correspond appropriately to the \nvarious threat levels. In essence, the Commission must redefine the \nbaseline security requirements for plants assuming a ``green'' alert \nlevel where no threat exists. The Commission should then require \nappropriate additional security requirements as alert levels are \nupgraded. This will allow plant operators and emergency response \nofficials to develop readiness levels commensurate with the threat \nlevel that exists."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","Balancing the Need for Enhanced Security and Limited Federal Resources\n    In determining the resources necessary to protect nuclear power \nplants, the Federal Government should consider the potential \nvulnerability of these plants relative to other potential critical \ninfrastructure targets and allocate limited Federal resources to those \nfacilities deemed to be most vulnerable to' terrorist attack.\n    For example, some in Congress have advocated federalizing nuclear \nplant security forces. As I mentioned earlier in my testimony, the \nindustry has a highly trained force of security personnel guarding \ncommercial nuclear plants. Replacing these forces with Federal \nemployees is unnecessary and would complicate the ability of licensees \nto coordinate the response of plant and security personnel in the event \nof a terrorist attack. Federalizing nuclear security forces would also \nunnecessarily limit the pool of potential guards by prohibiting retired \nmilitary and other government officials who would' be prohibited from \nserving as Federal security personnel and continuing to draw, their \nFederal pension.\n    Others in Congress and elsewhere have advocated placing anti-\naircraft artillery installations at nuclear plants to protect against \nan air attack. The industry believes that Federal resources would be \nmore properly focused on increased airport security to ensure that \nterrorists are denied access to the large commercial airliners that are \nof most concern.\n    Given the strong physical structures at nuclear plants and the \nhighly trained guard force to protect commercial nuclear facilities, \nresources may be more appropriately focused on other critical \ninfrastructure facilities.\n    Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to discuss these issues \nwith you.

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 1. Please explain your claim that the owners and operators \nof nuclear facilities have the greatest interest in protecting the \nsafety and security of the plants.\n    Response. As the owner and operator of a commercial nuclear \nreactor, Exelon's foremost responsibility is to the protection of the \nhealth and safety of the public and of our employees. Exelon Nuclear's \ncommitment is outlined in our Conduct of Operations policy, which \nstates that we ``will operate and maintain nuclear power plants with \nthe full commitment to public and employee health and safety.''\n    Thousands of nuclear plant workers and their families live within \nthe 10-mile emergency planning zone which surrounds commercial nuclear \nreactors. Clearly, these employees have an overriding personal interest \nin making sure that they do not take any action that would threaten the \nsafety or security of the plant.\n    From a business perspective, nuclear plants represent the largest \ncorporate asset of most nuclear plant owner and operators. The \nmanagement of the corporation would never place these assets at risk by \ncutting back on necessary safety and security measures. The safe \noperation of our plants is the first priority of plant operators.\n    Thus, while the general public undoubtedly shares our strong \ninterest in assuring that nuclear plans are operated safely and \nsecurely, the combination of personal and business factors mentioned \nabove make it clear that the owners and operators of nuclear facilities \nhave the greatest interest in protecting the safety and security of the \nplants."

Congress has the responsibility to provide guidance to--\nand to conduct oversight of--the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) \nand other Federal agencies regarding the level of security and safety \nexpected by the American public, but establishing the details of the \ndesign basis threat is best accomplished by experts in nuclear safety \nwho have access to the full range of intelligence information regarding \nthreats to nuclear facilities.\n    Establishing the details of the design basis threat through the \nregulatory process is beneficial for several reasons:\n    First, establishing the design basis threat requires a significant \namount of expertise in the area of threat assessment. The NRC and other \nFederal agencies have an established relationship with the intelligence \ncommunity and have established a process for gathering and evaluating \nthreat information.\n    Second, it is important that the NRC have the ability to update the \ndesign basis threat without the enactment of legislation, a difficult \ntask in the best of times. The design basis threat is currently \ncodified in NRC regulations and can be changed through the rulemaking \nprocess.\n    Finally, although the regulatory process can be lengthy, it \nprovides for significant input from all stakeholders and interested \nparties in a manner that cannot be duplicated by the Congress. \nRegulations are typically issued in draft form, with an opportunity for \npublic comment and, in some cases, public hearings.\n    The industry recognizes that Congress is responsible for assuring \nthat the NRC and the nuclear industry are examining and responding to \nthe events of September 11th, including the nature of the potential \nthreat to our national infrastructure.\n    The nuclear industry would welcome the opportunity to provide to \nthe Committee with more details on the nature of plant security and \ninformation regarding the many improvements in plant security \noperations that have been made since last year in a closed session."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 3. Could you please explain specifically why you believe \nthe requirements, standards, and qualifications of a federalized \nsecurity force would degrade security?\n    Response. Following the introduction of legislation in both the \nSenate and the House of Representatives calling for the federalization \nof the security forces at nuclear power plants, the industry conducted \na review of this issue through its trade association, the Nuclear \nEnergy Institute (NEI). NEI issued a lengthy report on the issue \n(``Implications of Security Force Federalization on Nuclear Plant \nSecurity Safety''), which I am attaching to this response. The report \nconcludes that federalizing nuclear power plant security could have \nseveral negative impacts:\n    <bullet> It could diminish and disrupt plant security by \nbifurcating the management responsibilities over the security forces.\n    <bullet> It could unnecessarily distract the NRC from its NRC's \nprimary mission of protecting public health and safety through the safe \noperation of nuclear plants by creating one of the largest law \nenforcement and security agencies in the country.\n    <bullet> It could reduce the stringent hiring standards, extensive \nbackground checks, training and performance reviews that are already in \nplace for our private security forces since existing standards exceed \nthe minimum standards specified in proposed legislation.\n    <bullet> It could squander vital experience that current forces now \nhave by replacing these private security forces with Federal personnel \nwith little or no experience at nuclear plant facilities.\n    <bullet> Federalizing nuclear plant security forces when nuclear \nplants are already among the most secure privately owned facilities in \nthe country may easily result in a mis-allocation of limited Federal \nsecurity forces. For this reason, the industry believes that Congress \nand the Administration should conduct a comprehensive review of \nsecurity at all critical energy infrastructure before making patchwork \nchanges in security requirements."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 4. Can you explain the concerns of NRC licensees about he \npossible legal implications of providing arrest authority to private \nsecurity forces and the possible remedies to these concerns?\n    Response. The nuclear industry largely supports the efforts of the \nNRC to increase the legal authority of our security forces. We are \nconcerned, however, that efforts to blur the distinction between local \nlaw enforcement agencies and private security forces may have \nunintended consequences. For example, a wide body of State and Federal \nlaw has developed to establish the rights and responsibilities \nassociated with the arrest authority of local law enforcement agents, \nbut it is not clear how the underlying principles would be applied to \nprivate security forces. For example, would the arrest authority of our \nprivate security forces extend beyond our perimeters to permit the \narrest of demonstrators that might block access to our facilities? In \naddition, would granting arrest authority to private security forces \nrestrict their ability to engage in interviews of individuals or \nconduct searches of an individual's property on the plant site?\n    Notwithstanding the authority to arrest or not arrest, our nuclear \nplant security officers are currently fully prepared to perform their \nduties to protect our facilities."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, POGO first began \ninvestigating security at nuclear facilities over 16 months ago. We are \nan investigative organization that works with insiders in order to \nimprove public policy. We have neither a pro- nor an anti-nuclear \nagenda. We began investigating the Department of Energy's (DOE) nuclear \nweapons facilities because more than a dozen insiders--current and \nformer DOE and contractor security officials, contractors with military \nexperience who test and evaluate the security at these facilities, and \nmembers of various guard forces--came to us with grave concerns \nregarding inadequate security pre-September 11.\n    Just prior to September 11, we completed our report ``U.S. Nuclear \nWeapons Complex: Security at Risk,'' concluding that our nation's ten \nnuclear weapons facilities, which house nearly one thousand tons of \nweapons-grade plutonium and highly enriched uranium, regularly fail to \nprotect this material from mock terrorist attacks. Once security became \na national priority, we briefed these alarming findings with the \nNational Security Council, the Office of Homeland Security, the \nPentagon Nuclear Command and Control staff, the staff of the Scowcroft \nEnd-to-End Review, the Office of Management and Budget, numerous \nCongressional Committees and Members, and at Rep. Chris Shays' request, \nthe General Accounting Office.\n    Because of this work, guards from commercial nuclear power plants \nacross the country began contacting POGO with similar concerns about \ninadequate security at the plants where they work. In April, POGO \naccompanied a group of nuclear power plant security guards to brief a \ndozen Congressional offices and Committee staff about their first hand \nconcerns. We then began working with current and former Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission (NRC) security officials and contractors with \nmilitary capabilities who test and evaluate security at commercial \nreactors. These people echo the same concerns about ongoing inadequate \nsecurity at commercial nuclear power plants.\n    My testimony is based on the information and documents gathered \nfrom these insiders. Again, I believe it is important to emphasize that \nour sources of information are not ``anti-nuclear.'' In fact, most of \nthem have worked in the nuclear energy field for most of their adult \nlives. We applaud the sponsors of Senate Bills 1586 and 1746, the \n``Nuclear Security Act,'' for several important provisions contained in \nthese bills."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Nuclear facilities are required to protect against a specified \nlevel of threat (known as the Design Basis Threat or DBT) from outside \nattackers and inside conspirators using a specific set of weapons. \nNRC's current DBT is wholly inadequate and must be made more realistic. \nAccording to published sources including U.S. News and World Report, \nthe NRC's DBT requires protection against only three outside attackers \nwith the help of one passive insider. This is absurd given the 19 \nterrorists involved in the highly coordinated, technologically advanced \nSeptember 11 attack.\n    Rumors are that DOE will increase its DBT to approximately ten \noutside attackers and significantly upgrade the weaponry and tools that \nadversaries can be expected to use in an attack; However, although some \nin NRC have also recommended an increase tots DBT, there seems to be \nresistance within the senior ranks of the NRC to committing to making \nthese improvements. There appears to be no justification for the NRC to \nhave a less robust DBT for nuclear power plants than DOE has for \nnuclear weapons facilities. A successful attack on either a nuclear \npower plant or weapons facility would cause unfathomable damage to \nsurrounding populations. We believe that the provisions in the \n``Nuclear Security Act'' for a new and significantly upgraded DBT are \nabsolutely essential.\n    In addition to the inadequate number of attackers to be protected \nagainst, the current DBT does not require protection against some of \nthe most dangerous weapons that are available on the open market today, \nsuch as 50 caliber API sniper rounds that can penetrate hardened guard \nposts and vehicles, nor do they use simulated chemical or biological \nagents that would require the guard force to be trained with gas masks. \nFurthermore, performance tests do not employ diversionary tactics that \nare likely to be used during an attack, such as remote controlled \nexplosives. POGO agrees with the Nuclear Security Act's provisions that \nthe new DBT include enhanced requirements for more realistic weapons, \nexplosives, tools, and tactics, as well as more outside attackers and \nactive inside collaborators."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Though the DBT is severely inadequate compared to what we now \nrecognize as the threat, half the nuclear power plants cannot even \nprotect against this current standard of three outside attackers. David \nOrrik, the head of the Operational Safeguards Response Evaluation \n(OSRE) program, testified before the House Commerce Committee on April \n11, that in 46 percent of the force-on-force security tests:"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","        ``the expert NRC team identified a significant weakness--\n        significant being defined as the adversary team simulating \n        sabotaging a target set, which would lead to core damage and in \n        many cases, to a probable radioactive release. It is important \n        to note that, even with adequate time for the plants to prepare \n        and make themselves ready for the OSRE, that 46 percent still \n        had--a weakness in armed response.''"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Let me caution the Committee--these tests are seriously dumbed down \nto favor the guard forces. The utilities are informed of an upcoming \ntest six to 10 months in advance giving them plenty of time to prepare, \nthe guards are usually aware of the attack scenarios, the mock \nterrorists are allowed to be made up of the utilities' own management \nstaff, and the weapons used in the tests are not nearly as dangerous as \nthose that can easily be found on the open market.\n    Despite their clear artificiality and imperfections that favor the \nguard forces, force-on-force performance tests are still the best test \nof the performance of a guard force in protecting key targets at a \nnuclear facility. This is the key issue that cannot be forgotten--can \nthe guard force protect the integrity of the reactor and the spent fuel \npools from a suicidal terrorist attack? The statistics say no. How much \nworse would those statistics be if the DBT accurately represented the \nvery real and sophisticated threat we know we are now facing?\n    The mindset of both the utilities and the NRC is far too \ncompliance-oriented--rather than performance tested. Our security \nguards are regularly told that security upgrades are unnecessary \nbecause the utility is already in ``compliance'' with NRC regulations. \nIn other words, if a checklist of requirements for detection, delay, \nand response is met--to include such items as a double-fence, alarms, a \ncertain number of guards--the facility is deemed secure. However, \nperformance tests repeatedly reveal that despite this ``compliance'' \nwith requirements, physical security and the guard forces cannot stop \nterrorists from causing catastrophic damage to the reactor. This \ninstitutionalized bureaucratic complacency may be the biggest \nimpediment to adequate security.\n    A post-September 11 example of this phenomenon is that armed guards \nare now required to accompany all visiting trucks coming onto the site. \nWe are told, there is often no extra guard available, and therefore, a \nguard is required to leave his post uncovered to accompany the truck. \nIn these cases, the facility may be in compliance with this new \nrequirement, yet guards are concerned that there is a hole in their \ndefensive posture."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    The NRC has never tested a power plant guard force's ability to \nprotect spent fuel pools--possibly the prime target of a terrorist \nattack. In October of 2000 the NRC started to recognize the problem of \nspent fuel fires in a study of the effects of accidents. However, in \n100 pages of analysis, they never considered sabotage by terrorists. \nThe NRC needs to create a target/assets list prioritized by importance.\n    Several spent fuel pools at nuclear power plants across the country \nare only 50 yards from the double fence line. In a terrorist attack, \nthe initial strike would likely be extraordinarily violent, fast, and \nwith a significant level of human carnage. According to Sandia National \nLab's ``Barrier Technology Handbook,'' it is estimated that a terrorist \ncould penetrate the fence line and breach a door or side of a secured \nbuilding in less than 60 seconds. We encourage the NRC to immediately \nrecognize spent fuel pools as a primary terrorist target.\n    We have been advised by military Special Forces sources of specific \nand obvious vulnerabilities at most nuclear power plants that I would \nbe happy to discuss with Senators or staff. I am uncomfortable, \nhowever, outlining them in public testimony.\n    To explain in general terms, a certain type of explosive, which a \nterrorist could carry on his back, would allow him to blow a sizable \nhole in the reinforced concrete bottom or wall of the spent fuel pool. \nAt nuclear plants that have boiling water reactors (BWR)--about one-\nthird of the existing reactors are BWRs--things could be even worse. \nThese reactors have the spent fuel pools above ground. In these cases, \na certain kind of explosive could even be launched from outside the \nfence line into the side of the pool. According to an unclassified \nstudy by Brookhaven National Lab, under certain conditions, the pool \nwould start draining immediately, which could result in the immediate \nrelease of high-levels of radiation, quickly turning into an \nuncontrolled radioactive fire, and the plant could do nothing effective \nabout it.\n    The Nuclear Security Act does require a plan to increase security \nof these spent fuel pools. In the meantime, we would encourage the \naddition of barriers and delay mechanisms to supplement security until \nthe spent fuel is placed in dry casks underground."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Guards from several of the power plants have registered complaints \nwith POGO about inadequate training as well. For example, one facility \nhired a new class of guards after September 11. The vast majority of \nthe new recruits had never fired a gun before. During their training, \nthey were limited to firing 96 rounds with their handgun, and far fewer \nwith their shotguns. Two guards quit after 2 months on the job \nbelieving they couldn't protect the plant in the case of a terrorist \nattack. They told POGO, and other guards have admitted to NRC \ninspectors, that their training is so inadequate; in the face of real \nterrorist attack, many guards would use their guns simply to protect \nthemselves while they escaped from the plant. Other guards with decades \nof experience protecting nuclear power plants bemoaned the lack of \ntraining outside the classroom, as well as the lack of modern tactical \ntraining. For example, their firearms training requires only that they \nbe capable of standing and hitting a stationary target 25 yards away--\nthey have no training shooting on the run at a moving target.\n    Additionally, the guard forces at nuclear power plants are severely \nout-gunned. Even the NRC's DBT assumes that attackers will be armed \nwith automatic weapons and explosives, yet many guard forces around the \ncountry are equipped only with shotguns and revolvers. We understand \nthat the NRC is working with the Committee on legislative language to \naddress this discrepancy."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","               SECURITY TESTS: MORE OFTEN AND MORE ROBUST"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    NRC's virtually defunct Operational Safeguards Response Evaluation \n(OSRE) program conducts force-on-force tests using mock attackers only \nonce every eight years at each plant. According to the nuclear power \nplant security guards and NRC inspectors we have interviewed, this 8-\nyear hiatus creates a woeful lack of focus on security between tests. \nAccording to the guards with whom we have been working, because the \ntests are announced so far in advance, the utility management has time \nto quickly invest in security training consultants to improve their \nposture and chances of success. The guards advise us that after OSRE \nforce-on-force tests, the security posture regularly returns to a bare \nminimum.\n    POGO agrees with the Nuclear Security Act's provision to require \nthat such tests occur no less than every 2 years to ensure that \nheightened standards remain in effect. POGO additionally recommends \nthat the utility only be given 24- to 36-hour notice and that the \nutility be required to freeze in place the guard force to be tested at \nthe moment of notification, rather than being allowed to call in the \nyoungest or most capable guards.\n    Currently, the mock terrorists and the attack scenarios to be \ntested are chosen by the utilities. The mock terrorists can be county \nor State police, the utility's own training staff, or even their own \nutility management staff--the very people who have a stake in ensuring \nsuccess. With all due respect to these people, and as genuine as they \nmay be in trying to test the physical security of the facility, none of \nthem are trained to have the mindset or skills of highly trained \nterrorists. POGO recommends the use of military Special Forces units \nthat are already trained to act as the adversarial team in force-on-\nforce tests.\n    According to the guards, they know within an hour or two when a \ntest will take place and what part of the plant the mock terrorists \nwill attack. They tell us that contrary to the full-page ads in the \nWashington Post and other newspapers, they do not normally wear flack \njackets or their communications gear, nor do they carry their semi-\nautomatic weapons. Sometimes, the guards are more than a football \nfield's distance away from their weapons and flack jackets. However, \nwhen the mock attack is about to take place, the guards are magically \nwearing their flack jackets and communications gear and have their \nweapons in hand. Even more troubling is the fact that, at one-third of \nnuclear power plants, the guards only have access to shotguns, and they \nare locked up at a central location. In case of a real attack, the \nguards would have to go to that location, unlock the cabinet, get their \nshotguns and protective gear, and return to their post. By that time, \nthe terrorists would have achieved their goals and caused catastrophic \ndamage. Ongoing, limited-scope performance tests should regularly be \ntesting the timelines for terrorist access to critical components.\n    If the facility fails a performance test, the Nuclear Security Act \nrequires re-testing every 6 months until it passes. We would recommend \nimmediately calling in a well-armed and trained National Guard unit as \ncompensatory action to supplement security until the facility passes a \nnew OSRE test.\n    We have learned from anti-terrorism experts that the worst enemy of \nany guard force is the daily grind of nothing happening. Guards are \nonly human. A simple way to combat this problem is to add unannounced \nchecks by the NRC to security testing. Fast food chains and the Postal \nService frequently use a ``mystery shopper'' to use a false ILK or \nexploit some other weakness. Because the guards know a ``mystery \nshopper'' may be in their midst at any time, they remain more alert. \nThis would be a very low cost tool that would significantly supplement \nsecurity."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    We recognize that federalizing the security force is a contentious \nissue. POGO believes that the same goals can be accomplished through \nfar more vigorous Federal oversight, along with upgraded training, \ncompensation, and authority granted to security forces.\n    Currently, security guards who are risking their lives are among \nthe lowest compensated employees at many plants. Pay scales and first \nresponder benefits for security forces, including life and disability \ninsurance, should be commensurate with those accorded to local police \nand fire departments. We cannot expect our security guards to give \ntheir all when we do not fairly provide for them in the event that they \nare injured while performing this dangerous and important job. Also, \npeople working at nuclear power plants, including NRC and utility \nemployees as well as contractor and subcontractor employees, should be \ngiven whistleblower protections. In the current climate of fear and \nwhistleblower retaliation, it has been our experience that people have \nbeen deterred from coming forward with important information that could \nhelp fix security problems. The Paul Revere Act, introduced in the \nHouse; and soon to be introduced in the Senate, would strengthen \nwhistleblower rights and extend them to Federal contractor employees.\n    We applaud the introduction of Senate Bill 1586 that recognizes \nthat security forces do not have enough authority to carry out their \nmission. Currently, guards are prohibited from using deadly force \nunless an intruder wields a gun; or they feel their life or the life of \nsomeone else is in danger, in accordance with State law. In other \nwords, if an attacker jumps over the fence with a backpack and runs \ntoward the reactor building or spent fuel pool, the guard can only \nattempt to chase down the attacker. We have been told of an instance \nwhen an NRC inspector observed a guard follow a mock terrorist during a \nforce-on-force drill as he destroyed critical target sets in the \nreactor complex. When asked why he wasn't doing anything to stop him, \nthe guard explained that he didn't have the authority to shoot an \nintruder who was only destroying property. The NRC has been trying to \nresolve this conflict for years. This legislation must remedy this \nobvious failure.\n    Local law enforcement and first responders should also be given \nclearance to receive safeguard information so they can better \ncoordinate emergency response plans. Currently, local law enforcement \nand first responders, in many cases, do not have adequate familiarity \nwith the layout of critical areas of the plant that is necessary to \nrespond to an emergency.\n    If there is any expanded role for the Federal Government, it should \nbe providing independent oversight, rather than management of security. \nRobust and credible Federal oversight is absolutely key to adequate \nsecurity at both the nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons \nfacilities. POGO has already recommended taking the security oversight \nfunction out of DOE, and we strongly recommend the same for NRC. NRC \nhas historically been altogether too compliant with industry's wishes. \nFor example, recently agreeing to industry's demands to replace OSRE \nwith industry self assessments of security was totally irresponsible. \nHistory has shown that the critical job of security oversight cannot be \nadequately performed from within these agencies. Therefore we suggest \nthat a small independent Office of Nuclear Security be created, perhaps \nhoused in the Office of Homeland Security, or perhaps as an independent \nagency reporting to the Congress and President. Its purpose would be to \nprovide oversight over and test the security of both government and \ncommercial nuclear facilities.\n    We would be happy to assist you and your staff as you work to \nrefine these pieces of legislation, as well as making some of our \ninside sources available to you so that you can learn from their first-\nhand experiences."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question. In your testimony, you indicate that the mock terrorists \nand the attack scenarios to be tested at the plants are chosen by the \nutilities themselves. Can you explain further?\n    Response. The OSRE does not use special forces military units, or \ntheir own trained adversary units, in their force on force tests of the \npower plant guard forces. The utilities are allowed to choose the \nadversary force--which is a key element of these tests. The utilities \nover time have chosen their own management personnel, their own \ntraining staff, and local and State police units as adversaries. This \nis a serious flaw in the tests. Even if these adversary forces are \ntrained at all, they are not trained to have a terrorist mindset--as \nsome military special forces units are. We strongly recommend that \nspecial military units, or OSRE's own trained adversary units be used \nfor force-on-force tests. The utilities are also allowed to choose the \nscenario to be tested--for example, the location of the attack, as well \nas the target. In that the guard force has 6-9 months to practice these \nparticular scenarios, the guards are never surprised by either the \ntiming of the attack, or the tactics of the ``terrorists.'' When they \nare surprised by an unscripted tactic, the utility complains that the \nadversaries ``cheated.'' For these reasons, and others, we believe \nthese tests are dumbed-down and not credible.\n    One way to address these artificialities in the oversight would be \nto create a permanent Office of Nuclear Security in the new Department \nof Homeland Security. We have come to believe that the nuclear \nagencies, including the Department of Energy, are incapable of serious \nself-evaluation. We have talked to OMB and Homeland Security about this \nidea, and they believe it has merit. Moving the OSRE function out of \nNRC and into Homeland Security would be a quantum leap toward serious \nsecurity oversight of our nation's nuclear power plants."

I never suggested that the new DBT be made public. In \nfact, I believe it should not be public. However, the Congress should \nfully understand the basis for and the credibility of the new DBT--not \nonly for the number of outside attackers, and the issue of passive/\nactive insiders, but also the kinds of weaponry, tools, explosives, \netc. that can be used by the adversaries.

During my 14 years at \nINPO, I completed 280 plus plant visits and at the time of my \nretirement, was manager of the emergency preparedness program for the \nInstitute. I have been to every plant in the United States at least \nonce, many more than once, and many outside the US. INPO's EP program \nincluded identifying areas of strengths and recommendations for \nenhancements for emergency response programs at nuclear power plants.\n    <bullet> Manager of the Emergency Preparedness program at PSEG, \n(Salem/Hope Creek plants) in New Jersey for 5 years. The 10-mile EPZ \nfor PSEG included two States, four counties, one NRC region, two FEMA \nregions, and again, multiple other Federal agencies.\n    Since my second retirement in August of 2001, I have worked as an \nemergency preparedness consultant in the nuclear industry.\n    As you can see, most of my career has been in emergency planning in \nradiation-related fields. And, like many people whose career is devoted \nto one area, I am occasionally reminded that many people are not \nfamiliar with the extensive history and experience in emergency \nplanning that is the standard for commercial nuclear power plants.\n    I look at my testimony today as an opportunity to provide \nenlightenment about an area that has, since September 11, generated \nconsiderable concern and much speculation among many Americans, and \nthat is, the history of emergency preparedness programs at U.S. nuclear \npower plants.\n    Emergency planning for nuclear plants actually goes back to 1970. \nIn my testimony today, I will review how the work of the past 30 years \nhas put in place emergency preparedness program elements to protect the \nhealth and safety of the public. This will include sections on:\n    <bullet> What is Emergency Planning?\n    <bullet> What is the Regulatory History of Emergency Planning?\n    <bullet> What are the Existing Roles and Responsibilities?\n    <bullet> What are the Existing Emergency Preparedness Program \nElements?\n    <bullet> What is the Experience with Nuclear Plant Emergency \nResponse Programs?\n    What is the Nuclear Industry's Commitment to Emergency Planning?\n    Any comprehensive history of emergency planning must include the \nregulatory history, complete with titles and citations that can often \nmake for laborious reading. But to not detail that history would be a \ndisservice to this committee."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Emergency Preparedness has three goals: (1) to protect the plant \nworker; (2) to protect the plant equipment; and (3) to protect the \nhealth and safety of the general public. An emergency plan and \nimplementing procedures provide the basis for safeguarding the \npopulation and the work force.\n    Since 1980, every nuclear power plant in the United States has been \nrequired by Federal law to create an onsite emergency response plan and \nensure that offsite plans exist to protect public health and safety. \nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approves onsite plans. Approval \nof offsite plans is coordinated between NRC and the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency (FEMA). Both onsite and offsite plans must be \napproved for the plant to obtain and retain an operating license.\n    Total emergency preparedness requires plans for the response of \nboth systems and people. The engineering design of the plant provides \nfor safe operations. The operating procedures address appropriate \nsystems response during emergencies. The emergency plan and \nimplementing procedures provide the basis for safeguarding the \npopulation and the work force.\n    In the nuclear industry, effective emergency preparedness depends \non mutually supportive planning. The multi jurisdictional nature of the \nemergency planning zone (EPZ) plan requires that arrangements must be \nmade at multiple governmental levels--contiguous counties within the \n10-mile EPZ cooperating with mutual aid agreements, joined by State and \nFederal agency coordination. Federal departments and agencies, State \nand local governments, voluntary disaster relief organizations, and the \nprivate sector work together to meet basic human needs and restore \nessential services after an emergency."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    In December 1970, the NRC (then the Atomic Energy Commission) \nintroduced emergency planning requirements into the regulations. \n(35FR19568, December 24, 1970). The content of application, technical \ninformation section was amended to include Section 10CFR50.34 ``A \ndiscussion of the applicant's preliminary plans for coping with \nemergencies''. 10CF50.34 embodying the first emergency planning rules, \nrequired a discussion of plans for coping with emergencies, and set \nforth-minimum requirements. Also, Appendix E provided additional items \nthat shall be included in these plans. (35FR19568, December 24, 1970).\n    In 1973, the Federal interagency responsibility for radiological \nincident emergency response planning was identified in the Federal \nRegister Notice of January 17. (38FR2356). The notice was revised \nDecember 24, 1975, and published in the Federal Register (40FR248).\n    In the January 17, 1973 notice, the Environmental Protection Agency \n(EPA) was assigned the responsibility for:\n    (1) establishing protective action guidelines; (2) recommending \nappropriate protective actions; (3) assisting State agencies in the \ndevelopment of emergency response plans; and (4) establishing radiation \ndetection and measurement systems.\n    In December 1974, the NRC developed NUREG75-111, ``Guide and \nChecklist for the Development and Evaluation of State and Local \nGovernment Radiological Emergency Response Plans in Support of Fixed \nNuclear Facilities'' to assist in developing the offsite plans.\n    In September 1975, the EPA issued EPA-520/1-75-001, ``Manual of \nProtective Action Guides and Protective Actions for Nuclear \nIncidents.''\n    In 1975, the NRC published Regulatory Guide 1.101 that set out the \nformat and content of onsite emergency plans. At that time, offsite \nemergency planning was required for licensing purposes only in the low-\npopulation zone (LPZ) located within about a 3-mile radius of the \nplant. The EPZ was defined in 10CR100.11. At this time the only plan \nrequired to be submitted was the plant plan.\n    In 1976, a Task Force of NRC and EPA representatives determined the \nappropriate degree of emergency response planning efforts. A joint EPA/\nNRC document in December 1978: NUREG-0396, ``Planning Basis for the \nDevelopment of State and Local Government Radiological Emergency \nResponse Plans in Support of Light Water Nuclear Power Plants.'' \nintroduced the concept of establishing emergency planning zones \n(EPZs)--the Plume Exposure Pathway (0 to 10 miles) and the Ingestion \nPathway (0 to 50) miles.\n    In December 1979, FEMA was assigned lead responsibility for the \nevaluation of offsite planning and response by President Carter in a \nWhite House statement and Fact Sheet. FEMA developed a review process, \nestablished in the 44 CFR350 regulations. These regulations were \nfinalized in the Federal Register Notice on September 28, 1983 \n(48FR44332). NRC retained jurisdiction over plant licensing and \noperation and onsite emergency preparedness.\n    In August 1979, extensive changes were made to the NRC's \nregulations following the TMI accident. The changes were noticed in the \nAugust 19, 1979 Federal Register pages 55402--55418. There were several \nkey changes to the regulations. These included the addition of 10CFR \n50.47 and major additions to Appendix E. The additions included \ndetailed instruction for developing the emergency response \norganization, assessment action, activation of the emergency \norganization, notification procedures, emergency facilities and \nequipment, training, emergency procedures, recovery efforts and \nemergency computer systems.\n    In November 1980, a joint NRC/FEMA document, NUREG-0654/FEMAEP-1, \n``Criteria for Preparation and Evaluation of Radiological Emergency \nResponse Plans and Preparedness in Support of Nuclear Power Plants'' \nestablishing the substantive basis for both onsite and offsite \nemergency planning. It required joint licensee/state/offsite agency \nparticipation in an annual simulated accident scenario (exercise) as a \ncondition for an operating license.\n    On December 16, 1980, memorandums of understanding written between \nthe NRC and FEMA were formalized.\n    In September 1984, the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan \n(FRERP), published as an interim document in the September 12, 1984, \nFederal Register (29FR35896) outlined the authority and responsibility \nof each of the 12 Federal agencies that have the resource and \ncapabilities needed to respond to a radiological emergency. The plan \nwas first tested in a full-scale exercise at the St. Lucie Nuclear \nFacility on March 6-8, 1984. FEMA published the final operational FRERP \nin the November 8, 1985, Federal Register (50FR46542).\n    In February 1985, the NRC/FEMA response was published in NUREG-098 \n1/FEMA-51, Rev. l, ``NRC/FEMA Operational Response Procedures for \nResponse to a Commercial Nuclear Reactor Accident''.\n    In November 1985, FEMA issued FEMA-REP-10, ``Guide for the \nEvaluation of Alert and Notification Systems for Nuclear Power \nPlants''. The Guide establishes the areas to be reviewed and the \nacceptance criteria.\n    In November 1986, FEMA issued Guidance Memorandum EV-2, \n``Protective Actions for School Children''. The purpose of the guidance \nis to assist State and local government officials and administrators of \npublic and private schools in developing emergency response plans for \nuse in protecting the students.\n    In 1992, the Federal Response Plan (FRP) was implemented. (This \ncomprehensive plan may be implemented concurrently with the Federal \nRadiological Emergency Response Plan (FRERP), which details the Federal \nresponse to a peacetime radiological emergency). The FRP describes the \npolicies, planning assumptions, concept of operations, response and \nrecovery actions, and responsibilities of 27 Federal departments and \nagencies, including the American Red Cross, that guide Federal \noperations following residential declaration or emergency.\n    In July 1996, a Federal Register notice announced the strategic \nreview of FEMA's Radiological Emergency Preparedness (REP) program and \nrequested comments.\n    In 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published the \nEPA Radiological Emergency Response Plan (EPA-RERP) to replace the \n1986, EPA Radiological Emergency Response Plan. The EPA-RERP has been \ndeveloped to reflect changes in EPA's programmatic and operational \nconcepts for responding to radiological incidents and emergencies. The \nnew plan represents EPA's integrated approach to management of \nradiological releases.\n    In 1999, the NRC's risk significance program; the Reactor Oversight \nProcess integrated the NRC's inspection, assessment, and enforcement \nprograms. The Operating Reactor Assessment Program evaluates the \noverall safety performance of operating commercial nuclear reactors and \ncommunicates those results to licensee management, members of the \npublic, and other government agencies.\n    The assessment program collects information from inspections and \nperformance indicators (PIs) in order to enable the agency to arrive at \nobjective conclusions about the licensee's safety performance. Based on \nthis assessment information, the NRC determines the appropriate level \nof agency response, including supplemental inspection sand pertinent \nregulatory actions ranging from management meetings up to and including \norders for plant shutdown. The NRC's revised inspection program \nincludes three parts: baseline inspections; generic safety issues and \nspecial inspections; and supplemental inspections performed as a result \nof risk significant performance issues.\n    In April 2001, NRC published new EP inspection procedures to \ndetermine, in conjunction with the performance indicators, whether a \nlicensee is meeting the Cornerstone Objective and Performance \nExpectation. The cornerstone objective is ``To ensure that the licensee \nis capable of implementing adequate measures to protect the public \nhealth and safety in the event of a radiological emergency''. The \ncornerstone performance expectation is ``Demonstration that reasonable \nassurance exists that the licensee can effectively implement its \nemergency plan to adequately protect the public health and safety in \nthe event of a radiological emergency.''\n    In September 2001, FEMA published the ``Radiological Emergency \nPreparedness: Exercise Evaluation Methodology'' (66FR47526), the \nRadiological Emergency Preparedness exercise evaluation areas and \nassociated criteria, to be effective October 1, 2001.\n    In April 2002, FEMA published corrections to certain provisions of \nthe ``Radiological Emergency Preparedness Exercise Evaluation \nMethodology'' exercise evaluation areas.\n    Since 1979, more than 2000 graded exercises have been conducted. \nIn-depth critiques are conducted following each exercise and areas for \nimprovement, as well as strengths, are identified. The improvement \nareas are corrected and tested in subsequent exercises to prevent \nrecurrence."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Before March 1979, accident at Three Mile Island (TMI), offsite \nemergency planning at nuclear power sites by utilities and local and \nState authorities was done under the NRC oversight and basically on a \nvoluntary basis. Specific requirements for off-site emergency planning \nas a precondition for licensing had not been established, and as a \nresult, the capabilities to respond to a radiological accident varied \ngreatly.\n    One of the major lessons learned from TMI was the need for a \ncomprehensive, coordinated response plan, by every level of government \nand integration with onsite and offsite plans.\n    To investigate these and other concerns, President Carter appointed \na special investigative body, the Kemeny Commission, to study the Three \nMile Island accident. Following the Commission's report, the President \ndirected that principal Federal responsibility for off-site emergency \nplanning around nuclear power plants would be transferred from NRC to \nFEMA.\n    FEMA had been established in 1978 (prior to TMI) in order in order \nto create a single emergency planning and response manager for the \nFederal Government. FEMA coordinates offsite measures at all levels of \ngovernment to safeguard the population, while NRC maintains \nresponsibility to oversee emergency actions taken inside the nuclear \nplant boundaries. NRC maintains its authority as the licensing \nauthority for commercial nuclear power plants; FEMA provides \nrecommendations and findings to NRC for use in its deliberations. Both \nagencies have issued extensive instruction in the Code of Federal \nRegulations to explain how their respective responsibilities are \ncarried out.\n    Following is a brief description of licensee, state, local, and \nFederal responsibilities:\n    <bullet> Licensees are responsible for operating the plant in a \nsafe manner and for being prepared to respond to a radiological \nemergency in a manner such as to effectively mitigate the consequences \nof the emergency. If an accident should occur, the licensee is \nresponsible for stabilizing the situation, bringing the plant to a safe \ncondition, limiting the consequences, implementing on-site emergency \nplanning, making off-site initial notifications and protective \nrecommendations and providing sufficient plant status information to \nassist in off-site emergency response. The licensee is responsible for \nmonitoring the plant and radiological parameters to determine the level \nof the emergency (unusual event, alert, site area emergency, or general \nemergency and recommend onsite and offsite protective actions.\n    <bullet> State and local agencies are responsible for maintaining \nthe offsite emergency preparedness. In case of an accident, the State \nand local designee will consider the emergency action recommendation of \nthe licensee and make any off-site protective action decision, \nincluding sheltering and evacuation. The offsite authorities are \nresponsible for activating the alert and notification systems. Having \nalerted the public, the State or local agency will provide additional \ninformation to the public through the electronic media including what \nprotective actions should be taken.\n    <bullet> State Emergency Management Agencies are the lead \norganization responsible for developing the State Radiological \nEmergency Preparedness Plan and for coordinating the development of \nassociated county plans. They have a lead role and responsibility for \nthe training of State and local emergency response organizations and \nfor the conduct of public information and education. (In California the \nlocal agencies have the lead role).\n    <bullet> State Departments of Health are the State technical \nagencies responsible for the assessment of the impact of a radiological \nemergency and the environment. These agencies also function as the \ntechnical advisor to the emergency management organization in \nradiological matters and protective actions.\n    <bullet> County and municipal emergency management officials are \nresponsible for the development and implementation of their respective \nemergency response plans. The Federal, state, county, and local \ngovernments have developed coordinated radiological emergency \npreparedness plans. The plans are coordinated with the licensee onsite \nemergency plan and periodically exercised to ensure a fully \ncoordinated, effective response and the availability by the required \noffsite support for an onsite emergency. State and local emergency \nplans have been prepared for every commercial nuclear power site in the \ncountry. All have received FEMA 44CFR350 evaluation and have been \ntested in exercises.\n    <bullet> The Federal Government's role is to support the licensee, \nState, and local agencies in an emergency.\n    <bullet> The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is the Cognizant \nFederal Agency when an event occurs at a commercial nuclear power \nplant. The NRC/FEMA response is documented in NUREG-0981 /FEMA 51, Rev. \n1, ``NRC/FEMA Operational Response Procedures for Response to a \nCommercial Nuclear Reactor Accident, `` February 1985. The agency \nmaintains a 24-hour-a-day Headquarters Incident Response Center where \nthe Operations Officer is an engineer or scientist specifically trained \nfor that job. The Center functions as the NRC's point of direct \ncommunication through dedicated telephone lines with all operating \ncommercial nuclear power plants. The Center notifies additional NRC \npersonnel, including regional offices, and other Federal agencies as \nneeded. During an emergency, the NRC establishes three teams:"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","        <bullet>  the Reactor Safety Team follows the course of the \n        plant event and attempts to anticipate future plant responses;\n        <bullet>  the Protective Measures Team follows the event from \n        the radiological standpoint; and\n        <bullet>  the headquarters Executive Team determines if or when \n        to escalate the NRC response."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    The teams also include Congressional, Government, and Public \nAffairs liaison. NRC participates in a licensee-graded exercise once \neach quarter.\n    <bullet> The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is \nresponsible for off-site emergency plans and maintains the Emergency \nInformation and Coordination Center (EICC) in Washington, DC, with \ncommunications capability to its regions and other Federal agencies. \nFEMA's Radiological Emergency Preparedness Program (REP) has a two fold \nemphasis: (1) assistance to State and local governments in developing \nemergency plans (44 CFR 350); (2) coordination of Federal agencies' \nassignments to carry out Federal functions (44 CFR 351)."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","     D. WHAT ARE THE ELEMENTS OF AN EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PROGRAM?"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    All U.S. nuclear reactor facilities are required to participate in \nindependently reviewed; full-scale emergency exercises every 2 years \n(and training drills in off years). For each exercise, the licensee \ncreates a confidential emergency scenario to be played out by plant \nstaff and local emergency response organizations, including law \nenforcement, local hospitals, radiological monitoring teams and others. \nPost-exercise critiques by the Federal agencies and exercise \nparticipants identify areas that need to be corrected in future \nexercises or improvements that need to be made to the plan itself. \nFollowing is a brief summary of the elements that are tested regularly:\n    <bullet> Onsite Emergency Organization.--The licensee is \nresponsible for developing the onsite emergency organization of plant \nstaff personnel for all shifts. An emergency coordinator must be \ndesignated who shall be on shift at all times and have the authority \nand responsibility to immediately and unilaterally initiate any \nemergency actions required to protect the health and safety of the \npublic. Certain responsibilities cannot be delegated to others in the \norganization, including the decision to notify and to recommend \nprotective actions to authorities responsible for offsite emergency \nmeasures.\n    <bullet> Emergency Classification System.--All utilities at all \ncommercial nuclear power plants use a standard emergency classification \nsystem. The emergency classification system provides for graduated \nlevels of response from minor events of low consequence to very severe \nevents. Specific Emergency Action Levels (EAL) trigger each \nclassification.\n    <bullet> Emergency Communications and Notification Methods and \nProcedures.--The licensee must have the capability to notify \nresponsible State and local government agencies within 15 minutes after \ndeclaring one of four emergency action levels. The licensee must also \ndemonstrate that administrative and physical means have been \nestablished for alerting and providing prompt instructions to the \npublic within the 10-mile plume exposure pathway. The notification \nsystem should have the capability to essentially complete the initial \nnotification of the public within the EPZ within about 15 minutes once \nthe offsite responsible State or local authorities decide to notify \nthem. In November 1985, FEMA issued FEMA-REP-10, ``Guide for the \nEvaluation of Alert and Notification Systems for Nuclear Power Plants.\n    Offsite Communications.--Each licensee is responsible for a primary \nand backup telephone system to make notifications to offsite agencies \n(e.g., NRC, State, and counties) within 15 minutes after recognition \nand classification of an emergency condition at the plant. A dedicated \ntelephone line has been established between the plant control room and \nthe NRC's headquarters Incident Response Center. IE Information Notice \nNo. 86-97, ``Emergency Communications System,'' dated November 28, \n1986, defines the emergency communications requirements.\n    Public Alerting Systems.--Off-site emergency agencies are \nresponsible for notifying the public of an emergency and activating the \nnotification system. However, the licensee must be able to demonstrate \nthat a notification system is available within the 10-mile EPZ. Sirens \nare the predominant method of public alerting around the U.S. \ncommercial nuclear plants and Federal regulations have established \ncriteria for the design of acceptable siren systems. The number of \nsirens that are required for the 10-mile EPZ will depend on the \npopulation density, type of terrain and other limiting factors. The \naverage site will have between 50 to 85 sirens positioned throughout \ntheir EPZ.\n    Public Notification.--Once the public has been alerted to an \nemergency, the capability must be in place to provide an informational \nmessage or instructions to the public through out the 10 miles EPZ \nwithin 15 minutes. This capability must be available 24 hours per day. \nThe most common method of providing instructions to the public is local \nradio and television stations. Another method of providing instructions \nto the public is by the Alert Notification System (ANS), a system of AM \nand FM radio stations which provide or are capable of providing, 24 \nhours per day transmission and have backup power generation capability.\n    In order to instruct the public to tune to a specific radio, \ntelevision, or an EBS radio station for emergency information once \nalerted, emergency preparedness public information brochures are \ndistributed throughout the 10-mile EPZ. The brochures identify the \nmethod of alerting and measures to be taken once alerted. The brochures \ndiscuss the various protective measures that residents may be asked to \ntake, including sheltering, evacuation, and use of thyroid blocking \nagents or other precautionary measures.\n    <bullet> Public Education and Information.--The responsibility to \ninsure the education of the general public concerning radiological \nemergencies and protective actions is jointly shared by the licensee, \nthe State and the local governments. Information is disseminated \nannually to the public within the 10-mile EPZ. Specifically, \ninformation is provided describing how they will be notified in the \nevent of an emergency and what initial actions should be taken upon \nnotification. In addition, educational information on radiation \ncontacts and special needs for the handicapped are addressed, as well \nas how to obtain additional information.\n    <bullet> Emergency Facilities and Equipment.--Adequate provisions \nmust be made for facilities and equipment to support the response to a \ngiven emergency. This includes monitoring, assessment, decontamination, \nfirst aid treatment and transportation. The physical facilities include \nan onsite technical support center, an operational support center, a \nnear-site emergency operations facility, an onsite and offsite \ncommunications system, and a media center.\nEmergency Response Centers\n    Control Room (Onsite).--The Control Room is the primary facility \nwhere plant conditions are monitored and controlled and where \ncorrective actions are taken to mitigate degradation of reactor \nsystems.\n    Technical Support Center (Onsite).--The TSC is an emergency \noperations work area from that designated technical and engineering \npersonnel trend plant conditions in order to predict further \ndegradation and to devise appropriate corrective actions.\n    Operational Support Center (OSC) (Onsite).--The OSC is the assembly \npoint for personnel providing emergency assistance to the Emergency \nOrganization. The purpose of the OSC is to provide an assembly. and \nstaging area for essential operations support personnel who are \ndeployed into onsite areas.\n    Emergency Operations Facility (EOF) (Offsite).--The EOF is the \nprimary offsite center for the management of the licensee's emergency \nresponse, coordination of radiological and environmental assessments, \nand determination of recommended public protective actions.\n    Joint Public Information Center (JPIC) (Offsite).--The JPIC is the \nprincipal media contact point for the licensee, state, and local \ncommunities during a radiological emergency.\n    State Emergency Operations Center (EOC).--This facility provides \nthe management of offsite emergency responses. The State EOC will serve \nas a location from which local officials may request manpower and \nresource assistance.\n    Local Community Emergency Operations Centers (EOC).--The local EOCs \nserve the purpose of maintaining a communications point within each \ncommunity as well as providing this capability with other adjacent \ncommunities and the State. Each local chief executive can direct \nprotective actions to be taken for his community and can activate the \npublic alerting system for his community.\n    <bullet> Accident Assessment.--The means for determining the \nmagnitude of and for continually assessing the impact of the release of \nradioactive material must be available to respond to an accident. Dose \nassessment is performed using actual in-plant effluent radiation \nmonitors to generate the radionuclide source term, meteorological \ninstrumentation, and associated hardware to develop a dispersion model \nfor an atmospheric release, hydrological instrumentation to develop \ndilution factos for a liquid release, and the assumption of appropriate \ndose conversion factors (DCF) to account for the isotopic mixture and \nits concurrent chemical and physical state.\n    As part of the Radiological Environmental Monitoring Program, \nnuclear power plants maintain a fixed environmental monitoring system, \nwithin the 10-mile EPZ, consisting of Thermoluminescent Dosimeters \n(TLDs), air particle detectors and another environmental media sampling \nstations. During 12 and/or subsequent to emergency conditions, this \nprogram is modified to collect and analyze additional samples from \nexisting stations. Results are used to confirm radiation exposure \nestimates and environmental calculations.\n    <bullet> Protective Response.--A range of protective actions for \nemergency workers and the public have been developed for the 10-mile \nEPZ. Systems are available to warn and advise onsite individuals \nincluding employees not having emergency assignments, visitors, \ncontractors, construction personnel, or others in public access areas. \nProvisions have been made for these individuals to leave the site by \ndesignated routes to some suitable offsite locations.\n    If needed, monitoring and decontamination capabilities of \nindividuals leaving the site have been established. Having requested \nnon-essential personnel to leave the site, the licensee must have the \ncapability to account for all individuals onsite and be able to provide \nthe names of missing individuals within 30 minutes of the start of an \nemergency. The licensee must be able to account for all onsite \nindividuals continuously after that time.\n    The licensee will also make recommendations, if needed, to the \naffected State and local authorities. This may include sheltering, \nevacuation, or use of potassium iodide in a sector around the plant, \nearly dismissal of school children, or relocating individuals in a \nspecific sector. As part of this process, the emergency plan includes a \ndesignated evacuation route and relocation centers in most areas and \nshelter areas. People whose mobility is impaired and the means for \nregistering and monitoring of individuals at relocation centers have \nbeen established.\n    For the 50-mile ingestion pathway, the procedure for protecting the \npublic from consuming contaminated foodstuffs is addressed. The \nrequirement that dairy animals be put on stored feed is a protective \naction. Lists are available of the names and locations of all plants \nthat process milk products and other agricultural products.\n    <bullet> Radiological Exposure Control.--The licensee has \nestablished onsite exposure guidelines that are consistent with the \nEPA's Emergency Worker and Lifesaving Activity Protective Action \nGuidelines. These guidelines address providing first aid, performing \nassessment actions, and decontamination, removal of injured persons and \nproviding transportation and medical treatment of the injured. As an \nexample of guidance developed on this subject, FEMA issued Guidance \nMemorandum EV-2, ``Protective Actions for School Children'' dated \nNovember 13, 1986. The purpose of the guidance is to assist State and \nlocal government officials and administrators of public and private \nschools in developing emergency response plans for use in protecting \nthe students.\n    <bullet> Medical and Public Health Support.--Local and backup \nhospitals and medical services are identified for medical support of \ncontaminated injured individuals. The licensee is responsible for \nhaving the onsite-first aid capability. Transportation arrangements of \nthe injured persons to the medical facilities are also part of the \nemergencyplanning program.\n    <bullet> Recovery and Reentry Planning and Post Accident \nOperations.--Following the accident and when the plant has.been \nstabilized, the licensee will go into the recovery phase of the event.\n    <bullet> Exercises and Drills.--Each licensee is required to \nexercise its emergency plan annually. Each licensee is required to \nexercise with offsite authorities within the plume exposure pathway 10-\nmile EPZ biennially. All parties within the ingestion pathway 50-mile \nEPZ must exercise its plan every 6 years.\n    <bullet> Continual Improvement. Critiques and Corrective Actions.--\nFollowing each exercise or drill, the licensee and Federal, State and \nlocal emergency response personnel conduct an in-depth critique. Areas \nfor improvement are noted and placed in the licensee corrective action \nsystem. Corrective action attention is a year round responsibility.\n    <bullet> Audits, Reviews, and Self Assessments.--One element \nassuring corrective actions is the audit or program review process \nthrough which all emergency preparedness programs work. Program reviews \n(checks) range from one end of the spectrum to the other . . . from \nquarterly communications checks (internally and externally) and \nequipment/facility checks to independent program reviews of the EP \nprogram. Periodic (on a set schedule) tests of the prompt public \nnotification system are also a part of this process.\n    Audits are conducted by the licensee's own quality assurance \ndepartments and inspections are conducted at various times by outside \nregulatory groups such as the NRC. These audits/inspections cover all \naspects of the emergency preparedness program. In all cases, the \nassociated emergency plans and procedures must be reviewed at least \nannually and revised as necessary.\n    Licensee's periodically self-assess their program elements. \nFrequently the licensee will request a subject matter expert from \nanother department or licensee to participate in the self-assessment.\n    <bullet> Emergency Response Training.--Annual training of company \npersonnel (onsite and offsite) and training of noncompany personnel \n(offsite at the local level) is conducted. This process is continual \nthroughout the year. This element of emergency planning incorporates \nthe following methods: classroom instruction; performance-based \ntraining, walk through for specific groups within certain emergency \nresponse facilities and between facilities; integrated drills; training \ndrills; and medical drills.\n    <bullet> Emergency Planning Zones (EPZ).--In 1978, a joint task \nforce of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and US Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission (NRC) developed the planning basis for offsite \nemergency preparedness efforts considered ``necessary and prudent'' for \npower reactor facilities. During the development of the planning basis, \nthe task force received substantial input from other Federal agencies \nand the Inter-organizational Advisory Committee on Radiological \nEmergency Response Planning and Preparedness of the Conference of State \nRadiation Control Program Directors, which also included \nrepresentatives of the National Association of State Directors for \nDisaster Preparedness and the U.S. Civil Defense Council.\n    Subsequently, the planning basis has been adopted by the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, which assumed the Federal lead role in \noffsite radiological emergency planning and preparedness \nresponsibilities under order from President Carter in 1979. This \nplanning basis continues today as the primary basis utilized by the \nFederal Radiological Preparedness Coordinating Committee (FRPCC)\\1\\ \nwith respect to coordinating all Federal responsibilities for assisting \nState and local governments in radiological emergency planning and \npreparedness activities.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\1\\ The FRPCC is chaired by FEMA, and includes representatives from \nthe Departments of Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and Human \nServices, Transportation, Agriculture, Interior, Veterans Affairs, \nState, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, and the General Services \nAdministration, NASA, USEPA and USNRC.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    An important element of the planning basis developed by the NRC/EPA \ntask force is that it defines the geographical area around nuclear \npower plants over which planning for predetermined actions should be \ncarried out to protect public health and safety in the event of a \nradiological emergency at a nuclear power plant. In developing the \nplanning basis, the task force did not attempt to define a single \naccident scenario. Rather, the task force considered a number of \npotential accidents, including the core-melt accident release scenarios \nof the Reactor Safety Study.\n    The planning basis was related to two predominant pathways by which \na population might be exposed to radiation released as the result of an \naccident. The two exposure pathways include the following:\n    a. The plume exposure pathway includes direct exposure from \nradiation in a plume as it passes, as well as from radioactive material \ndeposited on the ground or other surfaces. The pathway also includes \nexposure from inhalation of radioactive material in the passing plume. \nThe recommended protective actions for the plume exposure pathway are \nevacuation from the area, or sheltering, if timely evacuation is not-\npractical. More recently, the States are considering whether to include \nthe distribution and use of potassium iodide to protect against \nexposure from radioactive iodine in the plume, as a supplement to \nevacuation and sheltering.\n    b. The ingestion exposure pathway includes exposure from the \nconsumption of contaminated water, milk, or foods. The recommended \nprotective actions for the ingestion pathway include near-term actions, \nsuch as removing cows from pasture and putting them on stored feed \nsupplies, as well as long-term actions such as monitoring and \ninterdicting sources of water, milk and foods, as necessary to protect \npublic health and safety.\n    The areas, over which planning efforts are carried out, referred to \nas emergency planning zones (EPZs), are associated with the plume \nexposure pathway and the ingestion exposure pathway. The EPZs are \ndefined as the areas for which planning is carried out to assure that \nprompt and effective actions can be taken to protect the public in the \nevent of an accident. The two EPZs are discussed in more details below:\n    (a) The plume exposure EPZ includes a radius of 10 miles (more than \n300 square miles) around the plant. The size of the plume exposure EPZ \nis based on the following conclusions by the NRC/EPA task force:\n    <bullet> Projected doses to the public from design basis accidents \nwould not exceed Protective Action Guide (PAG) levels\\2\\ beyond the 10-\nmile zone;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\2\\ Protective Action Guide (PAG) levels refer to criteria that are \nestablished by the EPA. The PAG is a level of projected radiation dose \nfrom an unplanned release at which a specific protective action should \nbe taken. For example, the PAG for initiating evacuation or sheltering \nis when members of the public are projected to receive 1 rem or more \nfrom an actual or anticipated release. The PAGs are published in EPA \nReport 400-R-92-001, Manual of Protective Action Guides and Protective \nActions for Nuclear Incidents,'' 1992.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    <bullet> Projected doses from most core melt sequences would not \nexceed PAG levels beyond the 10-mile zone;\n    <bullet> For the worst-case core melt sequences, immediately life-\nthreatening doses would generally not occur beyond the 10-mile zone;\n    <bullet> Detailed planning within the 10-mile zone would provide a \nsubstantial base to support the expansion of emergency response efforts \nin the event this proved necessary.\n    b. The ingestion exposure EPZ includes a radius of 50 miles (more \nthan 2500 square miles) around the plant. The size of the ingestion \nexposure EPZ is based on the following conclusions by the NRC/EPA task \nforce:\n    <bullet> The downwind range within which contamination might occur \nwill generally not exceed PAG levels beyond the 50-mile zone because of \nwind shifts during the release and travel periods;\n    <bullet> There may be conversion of radioactive iodine suspended in \nthe atmosphere during transit to chemical forms that do not readily \nenter the ingestion pathway;\n    <bullet> Much of the particulate material in a plume will have \ndeposited on the ground during transit within the 50-mile zone; and\n    <bullet> The small likelihood of exceeding ingestion pathway PAG \nlevels at 50 miles is comparable to the small likelihood of exceeding \nplume exposure PAG levels at 10 miles.\n    The 10- and 50-mile EPZs are currently employed in nuclear power \nplant emergency preparedness programs as the basis for planning, \ntesting and exercising predetermined emergency response capabilities."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question.  Your testimony provides a great deal of detail on \nemergency preparedness and evacuation. It cites several cases of \nevacuations using response plans developed by the nuclear industry. \nHowever, these examples were all populations less than 17,000. What \ncomplications do you expect with populations much larger than this? \nWhat effect would population density have on the ability to evacuate an \narea?\n    Response. The studies provided in NUMARC NESP-004 ``Identification \nand Analysis of Factors Affecting Emergency Evacuations,'' (Table 2-2) \n(Document Attached) provide a study of fifty evacuations of up to \n300,000 people.\n    In addition, a 1989 Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) study showed \nthat during the 9-year period 1980-1988, the United States experienced \n250 emergencies that required the evacuation of more than 1,000 people. \nThe emergencies ranged from hurricanes and floods to spills and leaks \nof toxic chemicals. Some critics have voiced skepticism that any large \nnumber of people could be evacuated in a short period of time, but \nexperience demonstrates the contrary.\n    The following are examples of successful evacuations of larger \npopulations for non-nuclear emergencies. All the evacuations were \nperformed safely and orderly.\n    <bullet> 300,000 evacuees of Hurricane Elena (Pinellas, Florida) 8/\n29/85.\n    <bullet> 150,000 evacuees Hurricane Gloria (Monmouth County, NJ), \n37,000 evacuees from New Hanover County, NC, and 50,000 evacuees from \nWorcester, MD, 9/26/85.\n    <bullet> 42,000 evacuees from Hurricane Alicia (Galveston, TX) 8/\n16/83.\n    <bullet> 25,000 evacuees from a transport accident (Cambridge, \nOhio) 6/2/87.\n    <bullet> 20,000 evacuees from a train derailment (Miamisburg, Ohio \n7/8/86.\n    <bullet> 10,000 evacuees from a chemical explosion (Superior, WI) \n5/6/82.\n    I am not aware of any evacuations in the United States that \nexperienced significant problems. State and local emergency management \npersonnel are well trained to effectively conduct safe evacuations, and \ntake this responsibility seriously.\n    The effect that a large population density would have on the \nability to evacuate an area has been demonstrated on a number of \noccasions, such as frequent evacuations of 100,000 plus people from \nlarge sporting events. I believe the type of planning we currently \nperform for a nuclear power plant provides a sound basis for large \npopulation evacuations."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    The United States nuclear industry, in coordination with Federal, \nState and local agencies has the most advanced and demonstrated \neffective emergency preparedness programs in the country, perhaps the \nworld. In partnership with our Federal, State and local colleagues, we \nare the recognized experts.\n    Even with the expertise and history, we are not complacent. Our \nhistory is one of continuous improvement and we are currently \nevaluating and responding to the implications of September 11, 2001. \nEmergency Preparedness performed interim compensatory measures in \nresponse to September 11 that included specific actions to:\n    <bullet> Determine the potential effect on the plant and on site \nevacuation strategies, modify procedures and equipment, as necessary.\n    <bullet> Review site response plans and take actions to assure the \nresponse to terrorist threats is well planned, tested and available.\n    <bullet> Provide emergency action levels (EALs) to ensure that a \nsite-specific credible threat results in a declaration of at least a \nnotification of unusual event. Review and validate the strategy for \nescalation to higher event classifications.\n    <bullet> Implement site specific, credible threat EALs per November \n6, 2001 NRC recommended actions, as confirmed by the NRC letter to NEI \nFebruary 4, 2002.\n    We, the industry and involved local, State, and Federal agencies \nbelieve that we can help the country in the War on Terrorism and \nHomeland Security by serving as a model for other industries and \ncritical infrastructure that have not had the same advantage of long-\nterm experience in testing and refining emergency preparedness \nprograms.\n    Question 1. In your testimony, you have provided an extensive list \non the history of emergency planning. Could you briefly highlight the \nmajor changes the NRC and facilities have gone through in response to \nnational security and other perceived threats since Three Mile Island? \nIn your opinion, do they respond well and make the necessary changes?\n    Response. The Three Mile Island (TMI)-related changes are only the \nbeginning of immediate and continuous improvements the industry made in \nemergency preparedness. As an industry, we continue to actively \nidentify and implement improvements to nuclear safety and emergency \npreparedness as an intended, industry safety culture that rests on \ncontinuing self-assessment and continuous learning.\n    As a result of the accident in March 1979 at the TMI site, several \nstudy groups were formed to study the responses to the accident and to \nmake recommendations for corrective actions.\n    On April 11, 1979, in response to TMI, President Carter established \na Commission to conduct . . . ``a comprehensive study and investigation \nof the recent accident involving the nuclear power facility on Three \nMile Island in Pennsylvania.'' Dr. John G. Kemeny, then President of \nDartmouth College chaired the Commission. The ``Report of the \nPresident's Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island'' (Kemeny \nCommission) concluded that prior to the accident, emergency planning \nhad not received sufficient priority and that programs needed to be \nupgraded.\n    Recommendations made by the Kemeny Commission included:\n    1. Responsibility for offsite emergency planning should be assigned \nto the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); before an operating \nlicense is granted the State must have an emergency plan approved by \nFEMA.\n    2. Planning should involve the identification of several different \nkinds of accidents with different possible offsite radiological \nconsequences; local communities should have funds and support adequate \nfor preparing these plans\n    3. Medical means should be developed for protecting the public \nagainst radiation.\n    4. The public should be better informed about nuclear power and \ngiven clear information on what actions to take during emergencies\n    5. Further studies should be conducted with reference to evacuation \nplanning and methodologies.\n    6. The role of various Federal support agencies must be specified.\n    The industry made a strong and comprehensive response to the \noverall recommendation, ``Utilities must make sufficient advance \npreparation for the mitigation of emergencies . . .'' The industry's \nresponse included, but was not limited to, the following:\n    <bullet> Utilities have established emergency response \norganizations using personnel with a wide variety of technical \nexpertises useful in responding to emergencies. Members of emergency \nresponse organizations are designated and trained in advance regarding \ntheir roles during an emergency.\n    <bullet> Using scenario information similar to a real event, \npractice emergency drills are held several times a year so emergency \nteams can develop and maintain proficiency in their emergency response \nroles. Each utility is also required to regularly pass a Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission (NRC) and Federal Emergency Management Agency \n(FEMA) graded exercise that tests the level of preparedness within the \n10-mile emergency planning zone. The exercises are conducted every two \nyears involving utility, local, and state emergency organizations and \nresponse teams. Emergency preparedness programs within the 50-mile \nemergency planning zone are tested every six years.\n    <bullet> Each plant now maintains an onsite technical support \ncenter that is activated and staffed during an emergency to assist the \nplant operations staff. Emergency off-site facilities have also been \nestablished that are activated and staffed by utility personnel during \nan emergency to coordinate off-site support for the utility. local, \nState, and Federal emergency response organizations.\n    <bullet> The industry now has in place mutual assistance agreements \nin which all utilities agree to share their resources promptly in the \nevent of a transportation accident or a plant emergency. An Emergency \nResources Manual, maintained for the industry by the Institute of \nNuclear Power Operations (INPO) lists emergency response points of \ncontact at all utilities, identifies equipment and technical expertise \navailable at various organizations, and provides copies of the \nagreements that specify the terms and conditions that apply to exchange \nof equipment or services provided.\n    Another recommendation, ``Emergency plans must detail clearly and \nconsistently the actions public officials and utilities should take in \nthe event of off-site radiation doses resulting from release of \nradioactivity . . .'' also received strong industry response.\n    <bullet> Each nuclear utility has developed station and corporate \nemergency plans to coordinate their response efforts in the event of a \nsignificant release of radioactivity off-site. These comprehensive \nradiological emergency response plans were developed in conjunction \nwith State and local governments to define the actions to be taken by \neach party to protect the public's health and safety. Supporting \nimplementation procedures provide guidance for accomplishing the \ndetailed actions.\n    <bullet> The effectiveness of these plans has been demonstrated \nthrough the successful completion of regular federally graded full-\nscale exercises at all plants.\n    <bullet> Emergency plans also include provisions for providing \ntimely and accurate information to the public. Joint information \ncenters have been established where utility and government \nrepresentatives prepare press releases and hold briefings for the \npublic and media.\n    The Special Inquiry Group (Rogovin Report) reached many of the same \nconclusions as the Kemeny Commission. The report pointed out that the \nexistence of adequate county and local emergency plans is a critical \ncomponent of the overall emergency planning effort. The recommendations \nmade in the report include:\n    1. Workable evacuation plans must be considered a prerequisite to \ncontinued operation of existing and future reactors.\n    2. Plant operations, however, should not be made absolutely \ncontingent on approved local plans.\n    3. Adequate funding must be provided to local emergency planning, \nperhaps by the utility.\n    4. The emergency plan should be treated as if it were an engineered \nsafety system. If a portion of the plan cannot be carried out \n(evacuation cannot be carried out due to a blizzard, for example) \nconsiderations should be given to limiting operations.\n    5. Emergency planning zones should be developed on a site specific \nbasis\n    6. Existing reactors may be required to install additional accident \nmitigation systems to limit offsite consequences.\n    These recommendations, and many more, have been successfully \nimplemented and tested following the TMI accident. Additional post-TMI \nplanning requirements are listed in Attachment 1. These are just the \nbeginning of regulation regarding Emergency Preparedness programs. The \nregulations grew from these few to the current 28-feet of EP regulation \nin the Public Document room.\n    In addition to Federal regulation, licensee applicants have to \ndescribe the emergency plan in their Preliminary Safety Analysis Report \n(PSAR) and submit as part of the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). \nThe PSAR must contain sufficient preliminary information to ensure that \nadequate emergency planning will exist. The plans must show \ncompatibility of the onsite and offsite emergency plans, and of \nfacility and site design with respect to roads, population distribution \nand land use. The FSAR must contain detailed plans for coping with \nemergencies. The information must be sufficient to provide the NRC with \nassurance of coordination among the licensee and supporting groups \nprior to issuing an operating license for the plant.\n    The TMI-related changes are only a part of the scale and scope of \nemergency preparedness program improvements. The industry continues to \nactively identify and implement improvements to nuclear safety and \nemergency preparedness. This trend of continuous improvement is \ndemonstrated in the included graphs.\n    In conclusion, industry standards and NRC regulations and oversight \nrequire industry programs have the continuous capability to protect the \npublic from possible exposure to radioactive release caused by an \naccident or a terrorist event. All plants have comprehensive measures \nfor safety and security that include: Robust containment; Redundant; \ndiverse plant safety systems; Trained plant staff, skilled in accident \nand event response; Comprehensive emergency plans; Rigorous security \nplans and well-trained and equipped security forces; Established \nfacilities and equipment to support accident mitigation and \ncommunications with offsite emergency response organizations; Alert and \nnotification systems, such as siren systems, to notify the public of an \nevent; and Annual, communications with the population within the 10-\nmile emergency planning zone describing what to do in the case of an \nemergency."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 2. In your testimony, you discuss and provide several \nexamples of situations where nuclear power plant emergency response \nplans have been activated successfully by local officials to support \nevacuations for other, non-nuclear events. Can you please provide a \nfuller set of examples and/or references that more fully describe such \nsituations?\n    Response. A 1989 Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) study showed that \nduring the nine year period 1980-1988, the United States experienced \n250 emergencies that required the evacuation of more than 1,000 people. \nThe emergencies ranged from hurricanes and floods to spills and leaks \nof toxic chemicals. Some critics have voiced skepticism that any large \nnumber of people could be evacuated in a short period of time, but \nexperience demonstrates the contrary.\n    Evacuation plans have never been used to evacuate a nuclear power \nplant in the event of an emergency. Several nuclear emergency response \nplans, however, were activated successfully by local officials for use \nin non-nuclear emergencies. All the evacuations were performed safely \nand orderly. A few examples:\n    <bullet> The evacuation of 10,000 people from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, \nin July 1985, following a fire at a city-operated sewage treatment \nplant that dispersed a black cloud of toxic gas fumes over the city. \nState and local officials used a plan developed for the now Nuclear \nManagement Company's Duane Arnold nuclear plant.\n    <bullet> The evacuation of 17,000 residents of St. Charles Parish, \nLA, following a leak from a nearby chemical plant in December 1982. \nState and local officials worked from a plan for the now Entergy's \nWaterford 3 nuclear plant, which was in the late stages of final \nconstruction.\n    <bullet> The evacuation of 13,000 people from Naticoke, PA, in \nMarch 1987, when a fire from a metal plant blanketed the community with \ntoxic smoke. Pennsylvania Power and Light's Susquehanna nuclear plant \nresponse plan was used.\n    <bullet> The evacuation of about 6,000 residents and visitors from \nGrover City, CA, in July 1985, when a 10-day fire costumed more than \n75,000 acres of nearby grassland. The evacuation was based on the \nDiablo Canyon nuclear plant emergency plan produced by Pacific Gas & \nElectric Co.\n    Examples of large numbers of people that can be evacuated in a \nrelatively short period of time:\n    <bullet> In August 1965, nearly all the 150,000 people living in \nBaton Rouge, LA, were evacuated in only two hours following an accident \ninvolving a chorine-carrying barge.\n    <bullet> In June 1972, virtually all of Wilks-Barre, PA's, 75,000 \nresidents were evacuated in an hour after flood warnings were issued.\n    <bullet> Several large-scale evacuations preceding on coming \nhurricanes have been carried out successfully, including: the 1980 \nevacuation of 400,000 from Corpus Christi, TX, to escape Hurricane \nAllen; the 1985 evacuation of 300,00 from Pinellas County, FL, in \nadvance of Hurricane Elena; the 1985 evacuations from Connecticut, \nMaryland, New Jersey, New York and North Carolina totaling 318,000 in \nthe Path of Hurricane Gloria; and the 1992 evacuation of several \n100,000 from south Dade County, FL, as Hurricane Andrew approached.\n    NEI's 1989 study of evacuations found that communities that have \nconducted field exercises of emergency plans performed better than the \ncommunities that had not. The study concluded that there was \nsignificant value in testing plans, because such plans revealed areas \nfor improvement.\n    The crash of USAir Flight 427 in PA in September 1994 called on the \nexpertise of the emergency responders from Beaver County, who had \ntrained and practiced through the many years with the now First \nEnergy's Beaver Valley Nuclear Power Plant. Employees of Beaver \nValley's emergency preparedness department worked with the State and \nlocal emergency management agency personnel in the recovery effort. The \nplant also filled the state emergency management agency's request for \ndisposable suits, gloves, boots, etc. for use by the workers at the \ncrash site, which had been declared a biological hazard.\n    Additional information: NEI, (previously NUMARC) authorized an \nindependent study ``Identification and Analysis of Factors Affecting \nEmergency Evacuations,'' NUMARC/NESP-004, February 1989.\n    This study of the ``Identification and Analysis of Factors \nAffecting Emergency Evacuations,'' was undertaken in 1987-1988. The \nstudy effort entailed the compilation and analysis of data on emergency \nevacuations occurring in the United States since 1980. The study \nfocused on 50 disaster events that required 1000 or more persons to be \nevacuated.\n    The report shared insights, understanding, and knowledge gained \nfrom the collection and analysis of large scale, U.S. evacuations \noccurring in response to both natural and man-made hazards. The results \nof the study enhanced the level of understanding of the evacuation \nprocess.\n    Evacuations of the public in connection with natural disasters or \ntechnological/industrial accidents are a frequent occurrence in the \nUnited States. Emergency evacuations involving 100 or more persons \noccur, on the average, more than once per week. These evacuations \ngenerally have proceeded smoothly and safely without plans and with \nlittle evacuation training.\n    Following each United States census, utilities conduct new \npopulation density charts and could designate new evacuation routes, if \nsignificant changes occur in population densities or in critical \nlocations such as schools, hospitals, elderly care facilities, etc. For \nexample, when a minor bridge (not a primary evacuation route) was \nclosed for repair near the St. Lucie Nuclear Power Plant in Florida, \nextensive compensatory measures were put in place.\n    Communities around nuclear power plants are better protected in the \nevent of all types of emergencies than other communities, by virtue of \nthe emergency preparedness infrastructure that has been put in place.\n    Question 3. S. 1746 would provide for mandatory stockpiling of \npotassium iodide tablets for use by populations within a 50-mile radius \nof nuclear power plants, as compared to the current NRC program for \nvoluntary stockpiling within 10 miles and the provision for voluntary \nstockpiling up to 20 miles included in the ``Public Health Security and \nBioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002.'' What are your \nviews on the need to stockpile potassium iodide for populations out to \n50 miles from a nuclear power plant?\n    Response. The current NRC/Federal program requires States and \nTribal governments to consider including KI as a supplemental \nprotective measure (i.e., the State and Tribal governments make the \ndecision). The program is limited to covering populations in the 10-\nmile emergency planning zone around nuclear power plants. NRC will \nprovide an initial supply of KI tablets upon request, and may consider \nextending the program to fund replenishment supplies. Distribution of \nKI is a ``supplement'' to the primary protective actions of evacuation \nand sheltering in the 10-mile emergency planning zone and protecting \nfood and water supplies in the 50-mile ingestion-planning zone.\n    Attachment 2 is a listing of States that have agreed to stockpile \nor distribute potassium iodide.\n    In my testimony I discussed the technical basis for the 10- and 50-\nmile emergency planning zones. In 1978, a joint task force of the US \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the US Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission (NRC) developed the planning basis for offsite emergency \npreparedness efforts considered ``necessary and prudent'' for power \nreactor facilities. During the extensive two-year study the task force \nperformed a detailed analysis of the full range of possible reactor \naccidents to determine the appropriate distance from the plant that \nshould be used for planning prompt protective actions, such as \nevacuation and sheltering, as well as longer-term actions such as \nprotecting food supplies.\n    The task force received substantial input from all Federal agencies \nand relevant State agencies that would be responsible for implementing \nprotective action. Even following the events of September 11, there is \nno credible scientific or technical information to indicate the need \nfor a 50-mile distribution of KI or to suggest that the EPZs and \nrelated current regulatory system for emergency preparedness should be \nchanged.\n    The current KI distribution programs are voluntary and delegate \ndecision-making authority to State and local governments. S. 1746 would \nabrogate the authority of the States to reflect the specific needs of \ntheir people and could create a Federal program that would likely be \nless effective. Used nuclear fuel discharged from the reactor is not a \nradioiodine KI issue."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 4.  S. 1746 would provide for planning of evacuation of \npopulations from within a 50-mile radius surrounding nuclear power \nplants in the event of an emergency, as compared to the current Federal \nemergency program that includes planning for evacuation out to 10 miles \nfrom nuclear power plants. What are your views on the need to plan for \nevacuation out to 50 miles from a nuclear power plant?\n    Response. The above response contains answers to part of this \nquestion. The current NRC/Federal program includes provisions to extend \nprotective actions such as evacuation and sheltering beyond 10 miles, \nif needed. The dilution of resources and refocus of priorities to plan \nfor a 50-mile emergency planning zone, that does not have a credible \nscientific or technical basis, may degrade the current high level of \nprotection that is provided to citizens that live within the 10-mile \nEPZ that is based on our best scientific and technical understanding of \npotential consequences."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 5. S. 1746 would provide for emergency planning exercises \nout to 50 miles every three years. What is the current Federal and \nlicensee program for conducting emergency planning exercises and drills \nat and around nuclear power plants, i.e., onsite and at 10 miles and 50 \nmiles?\n    Response. Emergency exercises and drills are important as a test of \nthe planning, procedures, and training of utility, State, and local \ncommunity emergency capabilities. Planning, coordinating and evaluating \ndrills and exercises are major undertakings involving significant \nresources both within and outside the utility.\n    Utilities are required to conduct a full-scale; NRC graded exercise \nevery two years. During the off year, the utility conducts a self-\nevaluated exercise. In addition multiple training drills are conducted \nthroughout the year.\n    Under 10 CFR 50.47 and Appendix E the nuclear power licensees, \nState, and local emergency response organizations are required to \nexercise the 10-mile plume pathway emergency-planning zone biennially. \nThe 50-mile ingestion pathway is exercised every 6 years. Conduct of \nthe 50-mile ingestion-planning zone involves the full or partial \nparticipation of Federal, State and local agencies with the planning \nzone.\n    The specific response capabilities for the 12 Federal agencies \ninvolved in responding to an emergency at a nuclear power plant are \ncontained in the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan (FRERP), \npublished as an interim document in the September 12, 1984, Federal \nRegister (29FR35896). This plan outlined the authority and \nresponsibility of each of the 12 Federal agencies that have the \nresource and capabilities needed to respond to a radiological \nemergency. The plan was first tested in a full-scale exercise at the \nSt. Lucie Nuclear Facility on March 6-8, 1984. FEMA published the final \noperational FRERP in the November 8, 1985, Federal Register \n(50FR46542). This plan works in conjunction with the Federal Response \nPlan (FRP) that identifies the responsibilities of the Federal agencies \ninvolved in response to all emergencies. The FRP has been in place \nsince April 1992, Public law 93-288, as amended. The FRP represents a \nconcerted effort by the Federal Government to provide assistance in an \nexpeditious manner to save lives and protect property.\n    The FRP was developed through the efforts of 27 departments and \nagencies. The purpose of the FRP is to facilitate the delivery of all \ntypes of Federal response assistance to States to help them deal with \nthe consequences of significant disasters. This plan outlines the \nplanning assumptions, policies, concept of operations, organizational \nstructure and specific assignments of responsibility to the department \nand agencies in providing Federal response assistance to supplement the \nState and local response."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    In July 1979 the NRC issued NUREG-0578, TMI-2 Lessons Learned Task \nForce Status Report and Short Term Recommendations. The report \nidentified short-term engineering fixes to assure more reliable reactor \noperations, recommended the establishment of an onsite technical \nsupport center and operational support center, and specified improved \nin-plant monitoring and staffing.\n    In September, 1979 the NRC issued NUREG-0610, Draft Emergency \nAction Level guidelines, which established the four classes of \nemergency action levels (Notification of Unusual Event, Alert, Site \nArea Emergency, and General Emergency.)\n    On December 19, 1979, the NRC published for comment the proposed \nnew regulations concerning emergency planning for power reactors (10 \nCFR 50. Appendix E). The proposed rulemaking would incorporate the \nvarious NUREGs, recommendations, letters, and proposals which had been \nissued since March.\n    In January 1980, the NRC published the first draft for comment of \nNUREG-0654, Criteria for Preparation and Evaluation of Radiological \nEmergency Response Plans and Preparedness in Support of Nuclear Power \nPlants. This interim document was based on the draft version of \nAppendix E and public comment was formally requested under Federal \nRegister Notice 44 FR 9768 on February 13, 1980.\n    On August 19, 1980, the final version of Appendix E was adopted by \npublication in the Federal Register (45 FR 55410). It became effective \non November 3, 1980. Subsequently in October 1980, the final version of \nNUREG-0654 was published as NUREG-0654, FEMA-REP-1, Revision 1.\n Statement of Irwin Redlener, M.D., President, The Children's Hospital \n        at Montefiore; and President, The Children's Health Fund\n    Thank you, Chairman Jeffords, Ranking Member Smith and Members of \nthe Committee, for the opportunity to testify this morning. I am Dr. \nIrwin Redlener, a pediatrician and president of the Children's Health \nFund headquartered in New York and the new Children's Hospital at \nMontefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. I have had a career in public \nhealth and health services delivery spanning more than three decades. \nHowever, allow me to share some background information with respect to \nmy role in the matters before the Committee today.\n    First, on September 11, 2001 I dispatched two mobile medical units \nfrom our New York programs to lower Manhattan to participate in the \nenormous emergency medical response to the terrorist attacks at the \nWorld Trade Center. We also assisted in a number of additional ways in \nthe immediate aftermath in terms of medical services and continue to \nprovide mental health support to families and children throughout the \nCity who have been affected by the attacks.\n    In addition, with a colleague who heads the Center for Pediatric \nEmergency Medicine at the New York University Medical Center, Dr. \nGeorge Foltin, I established the New York City Task Force on Pediatric \nDisaster Preparedness in December. I am also a founding member of the \nTask Force on Terrorism of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Over the \nlast 8 months I have been working to ensure that Federal efforts \ndesigned to improve preparedness for terrorist attacks include specific \nprovisions to ensure the safety of children.\n    In New York City I have had regular contact, formal and informal, \nwith City and private sector officials responsible for disaster \nresponse. Since October of last year I have had continuous contact with \nFederal officials regarding various issues with respect to homeland \nsecurity. These issues have included my ongoing concerns regarding the \nsecurity of nuclear power plants in general and the Indian Point \nnuclear power plants in particular. Finally, during the 1980's, I was \nsignificantly involved in the analysis of Crisis Relocation Planning, \nthe response proposed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to \nthe threat of large-scale nuclear attack on the United States.\n    The September 11 attacks on the United States have had remarkable \nconsequences for Americans and for American society. In a real sense, \non a beautiful day this past September, we were both invaded and \nprofoundly shaken as a nation. For generations we have had a sense of \ndetachment from the grim realities which plague so many parts of the \nworld, where uncertainty and terror play out in daily life and the \npublic consciousness is always aware, on some level, of the potential \nfor deadly large-scale violence. Less than two dozen violent and \nsuicidal fanatics, connected to a diffusive and elusive global network \nof terror, has essentially ended the American reverie of protected \nisolation.\n    The cliche is that this is a ``new world'', and, indeed, it is. How \nwe respond, what plans we make, how we adjust ourselves \npsychologically, what resources we ultimately bring to bear and how we \nreorganize our government systems and agencies to prevent, mitigate or \nreduce the impact of on-going terrorism in the United States remain \nopen questions.\n    We will see conflicts between civil rights and necessary \nintelligence gathering capability; we'll struggle with interagency \ncommunications and rivalries over areas of responsibility and control. \nAnd there `will be major debates over how to prioritize and balance the \nresponse to terrorism against the ongoing societal concerns which pre-\ndate September 11, 2001.\n    However, no matter how these debates unfold, it is clear that the \nperceptions of risk, vulnerability and homeland security must rapidly \nevolve and adapt to the new realities of a Nation targeted by smart, \ncommitted agents of terror. There are, needless to say, a myriad of \ncomplex issues to be covered under the rubrics of the war against \nterrorism and the effort to enhance the security of the United States. \nOne of these areas, the subject of this morning's hearings, concerns \nthe potential risks and vulnerabilities of the 103 nuclear power plants \ncurrently operating throughout the country. Unfortunately, I also need \nto add that children, the elderly and the infirm bear a \ndisproportionately high burden of vulnerability to consequences of and \nreactions to a successful terrorist attack on a nuclear power plant.\n    Although the possibility of a catastrophic event occurring at a \nnuclear power plant as a result of accident, natural disaster or \ndeliberate act of terrorism has always been on the table, the events of \nSeptember 11 demand a re-examination of all aspects of the \nvulnerability and security of the nation's nuclear facilities. Simply \nput, what was improbable to the point of impossible, has become \npossible. Assessment of risk and specific planning scenarios need to \nevolve to new levels taking into account a much more aggressive, \neducated, trained and organized terrorist for whom capture or death is \nnot a deterrent to action.\n    A medical analogy here would be the mutation of a bacteriologic \nagent which becomes orders of magnitude more virulent and \nsimultaneously unresponsive to first-line antibiotics. Traditional \napproaches to prevention, early identification and treatment would need \nto change dramatically. In effect, this is precisely what we are \ndealing with in terms of necessary measures to secure and reduce the \nrisk posed by nuclear power facilities today in the United States. \nAcceptable risk and security measures appropriate on September 10, \nbecame unacceptable and insecure on September 11.\n    The potential consequences of failing to do everything possible to \nreduce or eliminate the population risks from acts of terrorism carried \nout against nuclear facilities are extraordinary and horrific. Attack \nscenarios well within the realm of possibility for many nuclear \nfacilities can have horrendous consequences for populations in the \nvicinity of a nuclear plant. Immediate civilian fatalities can range \nfrom a hundred or so to five thousand or more, depending on the extent \nof damage to the reactor, its support systems and the spent fuel \ncontainment systems. Excess cancers from radiation exposures can range \ninto the tens of thousands. Moreover, nuclear terrorism is in a special \ncategory of horror, evocative of the nightmare scenarios which first \narose during the height of the cold war.\n    Beyond the direct mortality and morbidity estimates, verified by \nnumerous studies of experts in and out of government, are layer upon \nlayer of unimaginable potential health and economic consequences from a \nsuccessful attack on a power plant. Studies by independent physicists \nand organizations, including the Brookhaven National Laboratories, have \nconcluded that thousands of square miles could be contaminated and \nuninhabitable for years or decades under a variety of highly plausible \nattack scenarios. In sum, the economic, psychological and societal \nconsequences of such an event in a major population center would be \nalmost incalculable.\n    For all of these reasons, it is imperative that we take necessary \nand prudent steps to reduce the likelihood of a successful act of \nterrorism against a nuclear power facility. There are two points which \nare, perhaps obvious, but worth stating:\n    First, to the very limits of our human limits, intelligence \ncapacity should be upgraded to the point where terrorist planning can \nbe disrupted prior to implementation. And, second, a cogent case can be \nmade for closing nuclear power plants altogether, particularly those \nwith inherent safety problems, those in highly populated areas with \ninadequate evacuation plans or those with relatively insufficient means \nof safeguarding spent fuel rods. The fact is that the Indian Point \nfacility meets all three criteria for closing, even though \ndiscontinuing energy production does not fully eliminate the risk and \neven though there would be modest temporary increases in energy costs \nin the region. In my opinion, this is clearly a case in which the true \nrisks to people of continuing operations are far greater than the \nbenefits, by any measure.\n    Putting aside the question of plant decommissioning, here are some \nactions that can be undertaken immediately:\n    1. Security at nuclear plants needs to be upgraded dramatically and \nimmediately, commensurate with our new and totally different \nunderstanding of the capacity and ferocity of terrorism on American \nsoil.-- The ``design basis threats'' which used to be the standard \nscenarios for anti-terrorism planning need to be upgraded, informed by \nthe events of September 11, to include a whole new range of potential \nactions for which security measures must anticipate, plan for and test. \nCan we explain to our children and grandchildren in Westchester County, \nNew York why special U.S. military forces, for instance are not \nguarding Indian Point? Incredibly, just 6 weeks ago the New York Post \nreported that a journalist spent 20 minutes flying over the Indian \nPoint facility. Can we explain why aircraft are not forbidden to fly \nover the plant?\n    2. All spent fuel rods should be stored in hardened, onsite, dry \nstorage facilities, pending a more definitive solution to the challenge \nof permanent storage.--Spent nuclear fuel rods in places like the \nIndian Point plant are kept in deep water pools. Unlike the reactor \ncore itself, which is in a hardened containment structure, the spent \nfuel pool is in an adjacent, comparatively lightweight structure. Many \nof these spent rod structures are covered with nothing more than a \ncorrugated steel roof. Moreover, the pools are now packed at high \ndensity, so much so that spent fuel will ignite and burn if water, \nessential to keeping the spent rods cool, is lost from the pool. This \nwould release a massive amount of radioactive material to the \natmosphere. Dry storage can make the spent fuel dramatically less \nvulnerable. Money is the only barrier to moving rapidly to hardened, \ndry storage of the used fuel.\n    3. There needs to be a top-to-bottom revision and upgrading of the \nemergency planning process, with active Federal oversight.--Planning \nfor evacuation in densely populated areas is extremely difficult. The \ngrossly inadequate emergency evacuation planning process around the \nIndian Point facility is a case in point. Spontaneous, uncontrolled \nevacuation in time of crisis, as happened at Three Mile Island, could \nquickly result in chaos and paralysis of egress. Permanent relocation \nfor evacuees in the event of substantial ground contamination would be \nan extraordinary challenge.\n    Reuniting school children and children in day care with their \nparents in the current plans are dependent upon wildly unrealistic \nexpectations with respect to the likely behavior of school bus drivers, \nemergency officials and parents. Plans are extremely insufficient \nregarding the size and scope of the area which would need evacuation in \na nuclear emergency. The same could be said regarding what to do with \nsenior citizens, hospitalized or disabled individuals and those who \nrefuse to leave. The entire notion of evacuation planning is so \nmassive, complex and resource intense that it is unfair and \nunreasonable to expect this to happen, if it can happen at all, without \nextensive and revised preparations and a strong role for the Federal \nGovernment. A recent Marist Institute survey on the subject of \nevacuation planning revealed that more than 75 percent of residents \nliving within 10 miles of Indian Point do not believe that the current \nevacuation plan is workable. Only a very small percentage of people \neven within a 10-mile radius of the plant know where the reception \ncenters are located. Chaos would ensue under any attempt to evacuate \nthe area in the event of a terrorist nuclear incident at Indian Point \nsince 60 percent of people within 50 miles of the plant, well beyond \nthe planning zone, would attempt to evacuate. We have every reason to \nbe concerned that people within the 10-mile evacuation zone would, in \nfact, not be able to leave because of road and transportation \ncongestion caused by people in large numbers outside the 10-mile range \nattempting to leave as quickly as possible.\n    4. Potassium iodide should be acquired and distributed on a ``point \nof use'' basis for a minimum of 50 miles radius from all nuclear power \nplants.--Radioactive iodine, I-131, is released from reactor explosions \nand, if inhaled or ingested in sufficient quantities, can cause high \nrates of thyroid cancer in children. If the proper dose of potassium \niodide (KI) is given prior to or within 2 hours of exposure to I-131, \nthis particular outcome, that is excess thyroid cancers, can be almost \nentirely prevented.\n    Because the window of opportunity to have this beneficial effect of \nKI is very narrow, it is not sufficient to have the drug only at \ncentral distribution points. It must be available at home, in schools \nand in day care centers. In addition, there must be a major public \neducation campaign to inform people about the benefits of having KI \nready for administration, especially to children and pregnant women. It \nalso must be pointed out that KI is not a ``radiation pill.'' It will \ndo nothing for any other consequence of exposure to cesium-137 or other \nisotopes. It is also essential that proper measures be taken by \ngovernment to ensure that food and water available for ingestion by \nchildren not have evidence of I-131 or other harmful radiation by-\nproducts such as Strontium-90.\n    These four steps would, in my estimation, be appropriate initial \nmeasures to prevent and/or ameliorate a terrorist attack on any one of \nthe nation's nuclear power facility. As a physician and public health \nprofessional, as a resident of a community with the least safe nuclear \npower plant in the nation--one which has 21 million people living with \n50 miles of the facility, I urge you to strongly consider these \nrecommendations and move forward as quickly as possible.\n    I also recognize that this is just the beginning and nothing more \nthan a component--albeit a very important component--of a much larger \nagenda. Even in the nuclear arena, there are many other concerns beyond \nnuclear plant security. The Federation of American Scientists and the \nHealth Physics Society have begun to raise important concerns about the \nstatus of so-called ``sealed'' and ``orphan'' sources of radioactive \nmaterials used in health care and many other industries. Management \ncontrol, security and oversight of these materials is variable to the \nextreme. Stolen radioactive materials can be used to make simple and \npotentially deadly ``dirty bombs'' which, if nothing else, have the \ncapability of rendering large land areas uninhabitable.\n    Again, I thank you for the opportunity to offer testimony at this \nhearing. I deeply respect the responsibility you and your colleagues \nhave in this time of enormous uncertainty and danger. On behalf of my \ncolleagues in health care and public health I wish you strength and \ncourage to do what needs to get done to safeguard all Americans from \nevery form of terror.\n    Thank you."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 1. In your testimony, you talk about how children and the \nelderly bear a disproportionately high burden of vulnerability to \nconsequences of a radiological release. Can you please elaborate on \nthis?\n    Response. Children represent a special level of vulnerability to \nany act of terrorism, particularly those involving chemical, biological \nor radiological agents. I have elaborated on the chemical and \nbiological issues elsewhere, but I would like to focus on the problem \nwith excess radiologic exposure. In incidents such as a successful \nattack on the main reactor core of a nuclear power plant, release of \nradioactive iodine, I-131, is rapidly absorbed into the thyroid gland \nof a child (most rapidly in younger children and infants) resulting in \na very dramatic rate of thyroid cancer. Although this can happen with \nadults, absorption is much slower and the cancer rates much less \naffected.\n    It should be noted that children are more likely to be crawling \naround the ground, more exposed to radioactive contamination, and more \nlikely to ingest toxic or contaminated substances. Finally, children \nneed to receive potassium iodide (KI) just before or immediately after \n(within two hours) exposure in order for the KI to have any beneficial \neffect.\n    Radiation sickness itself can be much more severe in children \nresulting in more rapid decline and greater loss of life. There are \nother potential health consequences, but the we need to also note that \nthe psychological needs of children in a time of crisis and chaos, in \nterms of potential separation from caretaker (school and day care) and \nneeds during evacuation make this a major issue, as well.\n    Seniors, more likely to be infirm, needing medications and other \nhealth related devices and management will have another series of \nspecial vulnerabilities during a time of rapid evacuation and \nresettlement"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 2. There are some who have testified today that it should \nbe up to the states to decide whether or not to stockpile KI tablets \nand how to distribute these tablets to their residents, should the \nstate chose to make them available at all.\n    Do you think it is important for KI tablets to be available to \neveryone living near one of these plants? And if so, how should \ndistribution be handled?\n    Response. KI distribution should be a national policy of the \nhighest priority, as long as any possibility of nuclear terrorism \nexists. A 50-mile distribution radius from every nuclear power plant \nshould be the absolute minimum, although a good case can be made for \nhaving a 200-mile distribution objective. Many cases of thyroid cancer \nin children were found at significant distances from Chernobyl \nfollowing the reactor accident there. Although some have made the case \nthat this resulted from the fact that children were allowed to eat \ncontaminated food, the evidence is far from conclusive. Distribution of \nKI, in any case, should be to ``point of use'' (i.e., homes, school, \nday care, etc.), not central stockpiles. There is no justification to \npermit states or localities to ``opt out'' of KI distribution.\n    Finally, a clear, on-going, public education campaign must \naccompany the plan to be sure that people understand what the dangers \nare and what is accomplished by administration of KI. It also needs to \nbe clarified that KI is not a general ``anti-radiation panacea'', since \nit does nothing whatsoever for any other issue than the prevention of \nthyroid cancer following inhalation or ingestion of I-131."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 3. In your testimony, you noted that lost or stolen \nradioactive sealed sources can be used to make a simple and potentially \ndeadly ``dirty bomb''. Are there any suggestions you could offer us on \nhow to better protect these so-called sealed sources.\n    Response. Much greater accountability is needed for the management \nof the nation's supplies of radioactive materials used in health care \nand throughout many industries. These sealed and orphan sources \nrepresent a significant vulnerability in terms of the construction of \nso-called ``dirty nuclear bombs'' by terrorists."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 1. In your testimony, you stated that our nation should \nconsider the ``closing of nuclear plants altogether'' that have a \nvariety of problems. What do you recommend be the process for \nevaluating a facility for this kind of drastic step?\n    How does the fact that communities rely on this low cost reliable \nenergy source or that a facility does not immediately become safe after \nit is shutdown play in this determination?\n    What impact would the closing of a nuclear site have on the \nelderly, poor, and children who are vulnerable to the high costs of \nenergy??\n    Response. Closing a nuclear power plant is an extremely serious \ndecision with obvious impact on energy production and cost, employment \nand other concerns. We are simply weighing risks and benefits and need \nto be extremely mindful of the dramatic increase of perceived and \nactual vulnerability that America has experienced since last fall. I \nalso need to emphasize that the closing or decommissioning of a nuclear \npower plant does not eliminate risk, but does significantly reduce \ncertain of the risks over time.\n    That said, there are clearly a large number of America's nuclear \npower plants for which the benefits of remaining active are overwhelmed \nby down-side risks and newly appreciated levels of vulnerability. In my \nmind there are a number of threshold issues which need to be explored \nin assessing the risk of any plant. Here are several criteria which \nwould lead me to suggest that a particular plant should be considered \nfor closing:\n    <bullet> Is the plant a ``high target value'' in terms of \npopulation density or economic impact of a potential successful attack?\n    <bullet> Are there particular vulnerabilities of the plant's \ncontainment systems for either the main reactor or the spent fuel rod \nstorage system?\n    <bullet> Is there a history of poor safety or security ratings?\n    <bullet> Is there a viable evacuation plan?\n    The Indian Point facility in Buchanan, New York, some 40 miles from \nmidtown Manhattan, for instance, fails all of these criteria and should \nbe high on the list of plants needing to be closed.\n    Still, even with all four of these criteria being met by Indian \nPoint, this is still an important question with major economic \nconsiderations for local and regional residents.\n    My feeling is, however, that under the circumstances, in the post-\n9/11 world of terrorist reality in America, we need do what needs to be \ndone. We are at war. If there is need to help the elderly and low-\nincome populations manage with higher energy costs, then, in my \njudgement, part of the homeland security strategy may well entail \nproviding an energy supplemental resource for those who need it."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Question 2. Are there any harmful effects of the misuse of \npotassium iodide?\n    If distributed widely, as you suggested, how can we ensure that it \nis not misused?\n    Response. The main harmful effect of potassium iodide would be \nrelated to over-dosage in infants which could result in dangerous \nsituations of low thyroid function with potential complications of \nslowing brain growth and development. This is preventable with \neducation about dose and administration of KI for providers and the \ngeneral public, just as we do for Tylenol, cold medications or anything \nelse we do for pediatric medication management.\n    Again, thank you so much for allowing me this opportunity to expand \nmy testimony to the Committee on Environment and Public Works."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    The Nuclear Security Act (S. 1746) represents a positive step in \nthe protection of public safety and health from acts of terror against \ncommercial nuclear facilities.\n    The Need for Timely Revised Design Basis Threat.--The STAR \nFoundation strongly supports the provision in S. 1746 which requires \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop a realistic and timely \nDesign Basis Threat for commercial nuclear power stations. We \nrespectfully recommend that this legislation include formal \nparticipation in the development of a revised Design Basis Threat by \nother affected agencies, such as the Defense and Energy Departments, \nthe Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Administration, the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation and the Federal intelligence community. \nSuch an interagency effort is necessary and will avoid the costly, \ninefficient, and largely ad hoc approach now being taken.\n    The NRC's current ``top to bottom'' review of security at nuclear \npower stations appears to have no endpoint. By comparison the National \nNuclear Security Agency (NNSA) within the Department of Energy has \ncommitted in its fiscal year 2003 Budget Request to establish a new \nDesign Basis Threat for the security of the nation's nuclear weapons \nfacilities by September of this year. The NNSA has already established \na dedicated taskforce to review current security measures and to \nprovide recommendations for a revised Design Basis Threat, which takes \ninto account the tragic attacks of September 11, 2001.\n    There is no good reason why the NRC should not follow the lead of \nthe NNSA and establish a timely revision of its Design Basis Threat \nwith a date certain. Due to the absence of clarity and timeliness by \nthe NRC, the Nuclear Security Act of 2001 (S. 1746) is very necessary, \nand if adopted, will establish the necessary Federal framework to meet \nthe challenges in this era of terrorism.\n    Protection of Spent Fuel Should be Given High Priority.--\nSpecifically, the STAR Foundation urges major emphasis be given to \nprovisions that which would reduce the risks associated with inherent \nvulnerabilities associated with spent fuel pools.\n    Unlike reactors, which are in steel vessels surrounded by thick \nconcrete containment, spent fuel pools, containing some of the largest \nconcentrations of radioactivity on the planet, are in unhardened \nstructures that include thin metal corrugated buildings. If enough \nwater drains by accident or design, the fuel could heat up and catch \nfire with catastrophic consequences comparable to a reactor meltdown. \nThis is of particular concern for the many BWR spent fuel pools which \nare elevated several stories above the ground.\n    The first place to begin is to promptly remove as much of the \n40,000+ tons of spent nuclear fuel as possible, and place it in \nmultiple, dry, hardened onsite storage containers. This will greatly \nreduce risks in the near term by reducing fire dangers and the \npotential for large radiological releases. The technology exists to \nachieve this important public safety objective and has been deployed \nfor several years on a modest scale in the United States and more \nextensively in Europe.\n    For more than twenty years, Germany officially recognized that \ndensely compacted spent fuel pools cannot be protected against acts of \nterror and has implemented an extensive dry spent fuel storage program. \nBy comparison, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which in its more \nrecent studies, concedes these risks may exist at U.S. nuclear \nstations, supports ``wall-to-wall'' fuel pool compaction. Before \nSeptember 11th the NRC had already reduced security, emergency planning \nand accident insurance coverage at eleven closed reactors with spent \nfuel pools.\n    In a world where animus against the United States remains high, and \nwhere detailed knowledge about nuclear technologies and access to \nadvanced weaponry are widespread, a national program to achieve safe \nand secure storage of spent reactor fuel should be given high priority. \nIn particular, efforts should be undertaken to further harden existing \ndry spent fuel storage containers, such as berming or additional \nhardened containment. The following illustration provides and example \nof what additional hardening of dry spent fuel containers might look \nlike."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    The costs of hardened onsite dry storage are not prohibitively \nexpensive and are estimated in the range of tens-of-millions of dollars \nper site. Currently a single dry cask unit costs between half a million \nto one million dollars. Additional hardening may double this cost. For \ninstance, a recent study done at Princeton University found that if the \nSalem Reactor station in New Jersey placed all of it's spent fuel into \ndry-hardened casks, the costs for 38 new dry casks would be between $34 \nand $76 million. However, the costs of doing too little or nothing \ncould be incalculable.\n    The Need for Logical and Adequate Nuclear Emergency Planning and \nResponse.--S. 1746 calls for the expansion of the emergency planning \nzone for nuclear accidents from 10 to 50 miles. The logic of simply \nexpanding the emergency planning zone does not necessarily provide for \nadequate emergency response and public safety. Even with an expanded \nemergency planning zone, the current system is unstructured and is not \nsite-specific, with respect to population density, meteorology, \nlogistical, transportation access criteria, and long-term risks from \nland and building contamination.\n    Instead the STAR Foundation recommends a framework for nuclear \naccident emergency planning and response be established as part of S. \n1746. Such a framework would include:\n    <bullet> Development of a specific prioritized system based on the \ngoals of (1) saving lives and early injuries; (2) and reducing \nradiation doses below limits of exposure (Protective Action Guides--\nPAGs) for purposes of evacuation, relocation and safe return.\n    <bullet> Initiation of a precautionary response when the \nprobability of a major release of radioactivity from a core melt or \nspent fuel fire becomes significant (10 percent or greater). State \nauthorities should have the technical capability to promptly identify \nand evaluate plant conditions that call for a precautionary response.\n    <bullet> Protective Action Recommendations should be based on \nmeasurements that are compared to pre-established long-term guidelines \nfor annual exposures--set as a small faction of the short term \nProtective Action Guides. The current system is based on measurements \nof contamination levels of food, water and land and buildings, without \nany regard for long-term exposures and critical issues such as when \npeople are able to return.\n    <bullet> There should be three zones:\n    1. 0 to 5 miles for ``plume protection''--emphasizing prompt early \nevacuation.\n    2. 5-25 Miles: for ``plume protection'' that includes evacuation \nand sheltering based on weather conditions.\n    3. >25 miles for ``plume protection'' for evacuation, sheltering or \nrelocation based on monitoring.\n    Because of the ability of large concentrations to travel and be \ndeposited over great distances, from weather conditions such as \nrainstorms, there should be an Ingestion Protection Plan based on \nProtective Action Guides set by the EPA for contaminated foodstuffs.\n    <bullet> There should be a classification level that addresses \nreleases from spent fuel pools and other spent fuel storage facilities. \nCurrently, there are four classification levels based on severity, \nplant condition, size of release, and accident probability, none of \nwhich apply to spent fuel pools.\n    <bullet> There should be intensive, broad-based pre-emergency \neducational in the ``Inner Planning Zone'' that goes from 0 to 25 \nmiles, and information dissemination in all other zones. Citizens \nshould be involved in the design and implementation of the educational \nprogram. There should be an upgraded flow of information during \nemergencies. Currently, pre-emergency education is limited to \ndisseminating brochures, calendars etc by the utility, with a 10-mile \nradius, as well as emergency procedures that are distributed to key \nlocations within the 10-mile zone.\n    <bullet> State authorities should have the independent technical \ncapability to identify, and classify the severity of an emergency. \nStates should also have a quick-reaction capability for plume tracking \nand dose projection. Currently, the reactor owner has the primary \nresponsibility for identifying an emergency and classifying its \nseverity. States are totally dependant on the reactor owner for \ninformation and have limited capability for plume tracking and dose \nestimation. Federal authorities have substantial plume tracking and \nradiation monitoring capabilities that are subject to several hours of \ndelay before deployment.\n    <bullet> Local counties potentially at risk should coordinate the \ndevelopment and implementation of emergency plans. There should be \nextensive ``horizontal'' communications among counties and \nmunicipalities. There should be extensive training, especially for \nvolunteer emergency workers and staff at schools, hospitals and other \ninstitutions. Currently, there is limited coordination and minimal \ntraining if any provided to potential ``at risk'' counties.\n    <bullet> There should be plans for screening and external \ndecontamination of persons potentially exposed or concerned about \nexposure. There should be plans to call in national medical resources \nin the event of a severe accident/event in which thousands of people \nmay require treatment for serious radiation exposures. Currently, the \nNRC requires screening for 20 percent of the people in a 10-mile zone. \nThere are limited arrangements for treating a small number of seriously \nexposed people. There is no explicit for the integration of national \nmedical resources in the case of a large-scale emergency.\n    <bullet> Emergency preparedness should be regarded as a safety-\nsystem equivalent to an in-plant system (e.g., emergency core cooling). \nAs such significant degradation of state emergency preparedness (e.g. \nfailure to remove snow from roads) should be grounds for shutting down \nthe plant. The plant's operating license should be contingent on the \ncontinuous maintenance of an effective emergency response capability. \nCurrently, there is a Federal requirement of an emergency plan to be in \nplace as a condition for continued plant operation. There are no \nrequirements that the plan be capable of execution when the plant is \noperating."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    As the 21st century begins, the basic concepts of warfare are being \ntransformed by the highly destructive acts of terror by small, well-\norganized groups against military and civilian targets. Over the past \ntwo decades, such attacks have occurred, tragically, with increased \nfrequency and destruction. Of particular concern are nuclear reactor \nstations. By virtue of their potentially enormous radiological impacts, \nnuclear energy facilities represent an unpredictable risk of becoming \nweapons of mass destruction at the hands of terrorists.\n    This concern was underscored by President Bush, on January 27th, \nwhen he informed the Nation in his State Of the Union Address that U.S. \nnuclear reactor information was found in a terrorist enclave in \nAfghanistan.\n    Nuclear power facilities have long been considered as potential \nterrorist targets, and limited programs are in place to protect them. \nBut, in the aftermath of September 11th, the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission concedes that U.S. reactor stations are not designed to \nwithstand destructive attacks using a jumbo passenger jet with a full \nload of fuel as a missile. For over three decades now, the NRC and it's \npredecessor--the Atomic Energy Commission--have refused to require \nreactors to be hardened against aerial attacks because it is considered \nprohibitively expensive.\n    After September 11th, nuclear reactors can no longer be viewed \nmerely as machines that generate electricity. The potential \nconsequences of a terrorist attack transcend cost/benefit analyses of \nnuclear energy. No other energy technology has the potential for \ncatastrophic releases of radioactivity, even greater than nuclear \nweapons explosions, causing thousands of deaths and cancers, and \nrendering large populated or farming areas uninhabitable, possibly for \ncenturies.\n    The only ``real world'' analog to the potential consequences of a \nnuclear terrorist attack is the tragic aftermath of the 1986 Chernobyl \nreactor accident in the Ukraine. Fourteen years after the accident, \nU.N. scientists estimated that some 74,000 square-miles in Northern and \nEastern Europe still remain heavily contaminated with cesium-137 from \nChernobyl. Large numbers of people still live in contaminated zones \nthat would trigger evacuation, and removal of foodstuffs, in the United \nStates.\n    There are no credible scientific tools to predict acts of malice, \nmuch less to compare the risk of terrorism with the benefits of nuclear \ngenerated electricity. A terrorist attack, by its very nature occurs by \ntotal surprise. Yet, knowing this, the U.S. commercial nuclear industry \nand the Nuclear Regulatory Commission have steadfastly resisted \ninclusion of terrorism into the underlying safety requirements for \nnuclear power stations, on the absurd, but technically correct basis \nthat terrorist acts cannot be foreseen.\n    In a world where animus against the United States is growing, and \nwhere detailed knowledge about nuclear technologies and access to \nadvanced weaponry are widespread, the security and safety of nuclear \npower stations should be of the highest priority."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    In terms of severe radiological impacts, the most significant \nvulnerabilities at nuclear stations involve reactor spent fuel pools. \nUnlike reactors, which are in steel vessels surrounded by thick \nconcrete containment, spent fuel pools, which contain some of the \nlargest concentrations of radioactivity on the planet, are in less \nhardened structures that include corrugated buildings. An attack \nagainst a spent fuel pool could drain enough water to cause a \ncatastrophic radiological fire that cannot be extinguished.\n    Depending on the reactor design, significant water drainage \nexposing highly radioactive cores could occur in less than an hour. \nOnce the spent fuel rods are exposed the zirconium cladding could heat \nup in a matter of hours to about 1000 degrees Celsius, and undergo \ninstantaneous ignition. As the fire a rages, the zirconium interacts \nwith the remaining water and steam, generating hydrogen, which further \nintensifies the conflagration.\n    Over the past several decades, the U.S. nuclear power industry has \ngenerated several billion curies of long-lived radioactivity, contained \nin more than 40,000 tons of reactor-irradiated spent fuel. One spent \nfuel pool has more long-lived radioactivity than was released into the \nnorthern hemisphere by all nuclear weapons tests combined. On average, \nspent fuel pools hold 5 to 10 times more long-lived radioactivity than \na reactor core. Pools at one third of U.S. reactor sites are in \nunhardened buildings, elevated several stories above ground.\n    The NRC concluded over the past several years that the loss of pool \nwater by accident or by acts of malice could lead to very serious \nradiological fires that are comparable or worse than reactor meltdowns. \nThe NRC also finds that ponds at reactors closed for many years could \npose similar dangers. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) concedes \nthat such a fire probably could not be extinguished; it could rage for \ndays. Most important in June 2001, the NRC staff informed the \nCommission that its spent fuel safety policy and procedures did not \ncover vulnerabilities to terrorism or sabotage. Despite these \nconcessions, the NRC staff recommended that the Commission greatly \nreduce security and emergency evacuation requirements at \ndecommissioning reactors and reducing accident insurance coverage by \nmore than half. Prior to September 11th particularly, worrisome is the \nlarge amount of cesium 137 in fuel ponds. With a half-life of 30 years, \ncesium 137 gives off highly penetrating radiation and is absorbed in \nthe food chain as if it were potassium. According to the NRC, as much \nas 100 percent of a pool's cesium 137 would be released into the \nenvironment in a fire. In comparison, the 1986 Chernobyl accident \nreleased about 40 percent of the reactor core's 6 million curies of \ncesium 137 into the atmosphere, resulting in massive offsite radiation \nexposures. According to a 1997 study done by Brookhaven National \nLaboratory for the NRC, a spent fuel fire could render about 188 square \nmiles uninhabitable and cause as many as 28,000 cancer fatalities and \n$59 billion in damage.\n    Despite the fact that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission recognizes \nthis problem, the commercial nuclear power industry thus far, has \nsuccessfully resisted security upgrades that involve the hardening of \nspent fuel storage. It is time for Congress to act."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Early this year, President Bush submitted a formal certification to \nproceed with the construction of a permanent high-level radioactive \nwaste repository at the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada. Much has been \nsaid by the nuclear industry and the Bush administration that opening \nthe Yucca Mountain site will serve as a primary means to protect \nexisting spent fuel from terrorist attacks.\n    Recently the House of Representatives, fueled by terrorism \nconcerns, voted overwhelmingly to proceed with a geological repository \nfor high-level radioactive wastes at the Department of Energy's Yucca \nMountain site in Nevada. Now the battle lines are drawn in the Senate, \nas arguments heat up over the risks of transporting reactor spent fuel \nversus disposing of it in Yucca Mountain.\n    Obscured in this contentious debate, however, is a more important \nand timely question. How can we protect spent reactor fuel already in \nvulnerable pools scattered across the country from terrorist attacks \nover the next 30-40 years.\n    The first place to begin is to promptly remove as much of the more \nthan 40,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel and place it in multiple, dry, \nhardened onsite storage containers. This will greatly reduce risks in \nthe near term by reducing fire dangers and the potential for large \nradiological releases.\n    Even if the Yucca Mountain site opens under the DOE's optimistic \ndate of 2010, large amounts of spent fuel will remain in pools for \ndecades, awaiting shipment. By the time the Yucca Mountain Repository \nfills up, reactors allowed to operate beyond their 30-year NRC \nlicenses, could generate over 40,000 additional tons of spent fuel for \nstorage in vulnerable pools."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    The current Design Basis Threat, which provides the ``envelope'' in \nwhich nuclear power station safeguards and security operate does not \nfactor in the type of attacks that occurred on September 11th. Guards \nare only required to protect against no more than 4 individuals, and \nhave not taken any steps to harden vital parts of the reactor station \nsuch as the control room and spent fuel pools. These latter \nvulnerabilities are the primary focus of the Project, because ``gates, \nguards, and guns'' are not sufficient to defend against an advanced \nweapons or aircraft attack against facilities that are similar in \nconstruction to ordinary commercial structures.\n    Nonetheless, the commercial nuclear industry strongly resists \nsignificant security improvements, particularly capital upgrades to \nharden facilities. Attacks against spent fuel pools were never part of \nNRC security performance tests prior to September 11th.\n    A major factor that fuels industry resistance to increasing the \ndesign basis threat is that the financial stability of much of the \nnuclear power industry has been undercut through deregulation.\n    As a result of utility deregulation many of America's nuclear power \nstations are now owned by limited liability corporations, (some with \nforeign partners) which possess questionable capital reserves. This \nmeans these companies may not have sufficient funds to manage major \ncontingencies such as major equipment failure and replacement, nuclear \nsafety upgrades, and increased safeguards and security. Under \nderegulation, these new reactor owners can no longer rely on a \nregulated rate base for cash-flow. Competitive market pressures and \nbankruptcy can put pressure on reactor owners to cut back on \n``variable'' costs such as meeting safety requirements, repairing \nsafety systems and other equipment, and having adequate staffing to \nensure safe operation. Adding to existing difficulties are the impacts \nof electric utility deregulation. Three nuclear power station owners \n(Enron, P,G&E, and Southern California Edison) are in bankruptcy."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    The purpose of this brief testimony is to provide preliminary data \nto support the contention that the current 10-mile radius of the \nemergency planning zone for plume exposure (``plume exposure EPZ'') is \ninadequate, in the event of a beyond-design-basis (``severe'') accident \nor terrorist event at a commercial nuclear power plant, and will fail \nto protect the public in accordance with Federal guidelines. Therefore, \nthe call for an extension of the emergency planning zone to 50 miles \ncontained in S. 1746, ``Nuclear Security Act of 2002,'' is an \nappropriate and prudent measure that merits serious consideration. In \nfact, such a change will be necessary to provide the level of \nprotection now called for by FDA and EPA in the event of a severe \nnuclear reactor accident.\n    We have used the MACCS2 code to generate estimates of thyroid dose \nand total effective dose equivalent (TEDE)\\1\\ to members of the public \ndownwind of a severe radiological release at a nuclear power plant, \ninvolving core melt, vessel breach and containment failure.\\2\\ The \ntotal radioactive iodine release assumed is about 60 percent of the \ncore inventory, similar to the release from the Chernobyl accident. The \ncalculated doses assume only exposures due to passage of the initial \nplume and due to deposited contamination for 1 week following the \naccident; thus long-term doses are not considered. Ingestion doses (the \nmilk pathway) are also not considered. The calculations are for a \ngeneric pressurized-water reactor and a single meteorological condition \n(atmospheric stability class D, wind speed 4.4 miles per hour, and no \nprecipitation). The exposed individuals are assumed to be 30-year-old \nadults.

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    The relevance of these values is as follows:\n    Thyroid prophylaxis.

To \nconvert the thyroid doses in the above table, which were estimated for \n30-year-old adults, to children, who would receive a larger thyroid \ndose for the same radioactive iodine intake, a factor of between two \nand ten should be applied, depending on the age.\\5\\ Thus the thyroid \ndose to children could exceed the FDA threshold for KI administration \nat even greater distances than for adults.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\5\\ International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), \nAge-Dependent Doses to Members of the Public From Intake of \nRadionuclides, Part 5, ICRP Publication 72, Vol. 26, No. 1 (1996).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Evacuation.

The 10-mile plume exposure EPZ was never intended to \nprovide significant protection against the long-term carcinogenic \neffects of radiation exposure, but was only intended to reduce the \nearly fatalities that could occur from acute radiation poisoning. \nNevertheless, the ultimate long-term health consequences of a severe \nradiological release would be catastrophic, and the government must be \nobliged to ensure that these longer-term effects be avoided to the \nmaximum extent possible.

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    The September 11 attacks have prompted new consideration of \nsecurity arrangements in the United States. They have caused us all to \nreconsider past efforts regarding security and to reevaluate the \nthreats we face. The nation, reluctantly, is adapting to heightened \nsecurity alerts, and airport security personnel have been federalized.\n    This era of heightened homeland security also has prompted the \nintroduction of legislative proposals to federalize security forces at \nthe nation's nuclear facilities. This paper addresses the implications \nof proposals to replace an established, skilled private security force \nwith federal guards at nuclear power plants.\n    Recently, airport baggage screening functions were federalized for \na fixed period to correct deficiencies that could not be solved by any \nother means. The responsibilities and attributes of airport baggage \nscreeners and nuclear power plant security forces, which protect the \nplants, are not comparable. Although they performed relatively simple \nand limited duties, airport security personnel were characterized as \nuntrained, unscreened, transitory, poorly supervised, poorly regulated \nand low paid.\n    In sharp contrast, nuclear power plant security forces, many of \nwhich have law enforcement or military experience, are subject to FBI \nbackground checks, physical and psychological testing and screening and \nsubstance abuse testing as part of the hiring process. The nuclear \nenergy industry is unique among energy industries in having a \ncooperative relationship with the FBI to facilitate such criminal \nrecord checks.\n    Nuclear plant security personnel also undergo rigorous training. \nInitially, they are provided seven weeks of training, including weapons \nproficiency and proof of marksmanship, recognition of sabotage devices \nand equipment, and tactical response training. Nuclear security \npersonnel are required to requalify annually in physical and physical \nfitness characteristics and in job skills. They are subject to a \ncontinuous behavior observation program for substance abuse and \npsychological fitness. On average, retention of the security force is \nabove 90 percent and the officers are paid an annual salary of $35,000 \nand provided a full benefits package.\n    The duties of these personnel involve both traditional industrial \nsecurity and defense of the facility against a specified, military-\ncapable land assault force. The industry's security forces are aided in \nthis effort by modern intrusion detection systems and barriers, \nbiometric and other advanced recognition technology for workers \nentering vital areas of the plant, internal fortifications and the most \ncapable weaponry permitted under law.\n    As a part of their training, security officers participate in \nexercises on an annual basis. As part of the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission's federal oversight of security requirements, the industry's \nprivate security forces must demonstrate their readiness during mock \nassaults conducted by federally supervised forces. No other private \nindustrial facilities have the combination of robust physical \nprotection, well-trained and armed security forces and emergency \nresponse capability that is found at every nuclear power plant in the \nUnited States.\n    All of these attributes of the industry security program are \nembedded in federal regulations and federal oversight. It is possible \nfor federally employed forces to replace private security officers, but \nit would result in numerous and significant disadvantages that could \nresult in diminished security at these facilities.\n    There are more than 5,000 privately employed security officers in \nthe nuclear energy industry. Their compensation levels correspond to \nGS-9 on the federal scale or E-8 (O-2) on the military scale. Owing to \nthe large number of the current force with prior military or local law \nenforcement backgrounds and the restrictions imposed by federal law \nand/or local laws associated with their existing pension credits, many \nwill find federal employment less attractive. They will choose to leave \nthis service and seek different private employment. This will result in \npotentially thousands of displaced workers and difficulties in \nrecruiting individuals with comparable backgrounds and skills. In \naddition, hiring a federal work force of more than 5,000 officers at \nthese pay scales may have significant impact on existing federal pay \nscales for current federal security forces with less sophisticated \nresponsibilities.\n    Legislative proposals such as S. 1746 to federally employ security \npersonnel at nuclear power plants would have the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission manage the program. Adding more than 5,000 employees to the \nNRC workforce would nearly triple the size of the agency and \nsignificantly dilute its focus on safety and oversight. The hiring, \ntraining and management of this workforce also could result in a \ntransition period of diminished efficiency and security protection. If \na different federal employer is chosen, the NRC as an independent \nfederal agency will be faced with oversight of another federal agency \nas well as the company that owns and/or operates the power plant. This \nwould dilute the NRC's safety focus as well."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Federal employment would result in a bifurcation of responsibility \nfor activities on a privately owned site. There would be two separate \nchains of command for site employees--one for the security force and \none for the plant operating staff. This may result in a cooperative \nworking relationship during routine plant activity. But in the event of \na threat against the facility, this division of responsibility could \nhinder the plant's response.\n    Protecting a nuclear facility against intruders requires highly \ncoordinated action on the part of both the reactor operating \nprofessionals and the security forces. Reactor safety could be \ncompromised without excellent coordination. Given the variety of \ntactical situations that could exist under an attack, this coordination \nmust occur in real time and under rapidly changing circumstances. Dual \nchains of command would make this coordination very difficult, if not \nimpossible.\n    Dual chains of command also complicate efficiency of operations. \nThe size and tactical deployment of security forces is highly dependent \non physical features and the use of intrusion detection and monitoring \nsystems. The placement and use of these systems also impacts equipment \naccessibility for plant operating staffs, which in turn has an impact \non reactor safety during normal operation and if the facility faces an \nattack. Resolution of these conflicting interests to achieve high \nlevels of both efficiency and protection will be adversely affected by \na bifurcation of accountability.\n    Security forces at nuclear facilities have multiple \nresponsibilities. They are responsible for industrial security and \nprotection of the plant assets on a daily basis. But they also must \ndemonstrate the ability to protect the facility from a defined attack \nscenario, as required by NRC regulation.\n    Undertaking both roles, a federal employer will face a broad range \nof new liabilities. This will impose a significant new dimension for \nthe federal government and will become a distinct disadvantage to \nfederal employment. Conversely, the dual responsibilities associated \nwith private employment of a federally regulated security force is a \nsignificant advantage. It allows the private employer to provide a more \ndiverse set of assignments for security forces. Without such diversity, \nthe security forces would be relegated to armed sentry duties only. \nMaintaining a highly alert security posture is difficult without this \ndiversity of assignments."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Whether the security force is federally or privately employed, \nthere are necessary and beneficial legislative changes directly \nimpacting the effectiveness of the security force that the industry and \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission recommend. Without new legislation, \nsome security forces are restricted in the use of deadly force, and \nstate/local laws limit the weapons that may be deployed on private \nproperty. Federal legislation is needed to remove these constraints and \nmake security programs consistent nationwide.\n    Clearly, private employees provide excellent nuclear power plant \nsecurity. Routine security could be accomplished by federal employees, \nbut entails significant difficulties that, in a practical sense, would \nresult in diminished safety, security and efficiency both during a \ntransition period and in the long run. This paper does not address the \nprotection of nuclear facilities and other parts of the national \ncritical infrastructure from broader acts of war. The industry supports \na broad analysis to determine the threats we now face and develop a \nseamless defense that integrates the capabilities of our industry, \nstate and local governments, and the federal government, including the \nCIA, FBI, FEMA and the military. Broader acts of war and the relative \nrisks of the facilities should be considered as part of this \ncomprehensive analysis.\n    Nuclear power plants are the most robust physical structures in the \nindustrial sector and are protected by highly skilled, well-armed \nparamilitary forces. The industry has been at the highest state of \nalert since September 11 and is reviewing its security programs to \nincorporate lessons learned from the attacks. The NRC also is \nconducting a ``top-to-bottom'' review of the federal regulations that \napply to nuclear plant security and the security. More than 20 of the \nnation's governors, state security directors and Members of Congress \nwho have toured nuclear power facilities since September 11 have \ncommented on the outstanding security programs.\n    The nuclear energy industry has always had an uncompromising \ncommitment to safety and security. The industry remains committed to \nproviding the best possible security for workers at our plants, their \nfamilies and residents of 31 states who live near the nation's nuclear \npower plants. The industry will work with the Bush administration and \nthe Congress to review and enhance our security as may be required in \nlight of recent events. However, a transition from private to federal \nsecurity forces at nuclear power plants is an illconceived and \nmisguided proposal that provides no enhanced protection of the public \nor the nuclear power facilities that provide electricity for one of \nevery five American homes and businesses."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    The Nuclear Regulatory Commission sets rigorous standards for \nnuclear power plant security measures and security forces. These \nsecurity forces represent an elite group of individuals--carefully \nscreened before hiring, trained both in general and facility--specific \nsecurity knowledge, and required to requalify every year.\n    Security begins with the hiring process. Applicants for security \nofficer positions must undergo detailed evaluations, including FBI \nbackground checks and evaluations of their psychological and physical \nfitness. Those who are hired are subject to ongoing behavior \nobservation and drug and alcohol screening. They also are trained \nregularly and evaluated in ``anti-terrorist'' exercises.\n    A clear chain of command is necessary for effective security at a \nnuclear power plant because of the close interrelationship between the \nsecurity force and plant operators. In the event of a threat, plant \noperators carry out plant emergency operations and procedures, while \nthe security force protects the equipment that is needed to maintain \nreactor safety. Close coordination between the security force and plant \noperators is best achieved when both are integrated under a single \nmanagement structure. Federalization would undercut this."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","                          Policy Implications"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    There are numerous negative policy and safety implications of \nlegislation introduced by Senator Harry Reid (S. 1746) and the \ncompanion bill (H.R. 3382) in the House of Representatives introduced \nby Congressman Ed Markey. Fundamentally, the legislation would weaken \nsecurity at nuclear power plants by unnecessarily federalizing nuclear \npower plant security. The proposed legislation also would have a \nprofound impact on the nation's energy diversity, environmental well-\nbeing, economic security and the national common defense. Those impacts \ninclude:\n    <bullet> Diminishing and disrupting plant security. Effective \nsecurity, including a successful response to a terrorist threat at a \nnuclear power plant, is highly dependent upon coordinated efforts by \nsecurity forces and power plant operators. By replacing the proven, \neffective security forces already in place at nuclear plants, the Reid-\nMarkey proposals bifurcate management responsibilities for these \nfunctions. Doing so will lessen the industry's ability to fully protect \npublic health and safety.\n    <bullet> Creating one of the largest law enforcement and security \nagencies in the country. The Reid-Markey legislation would require the \nNRC to hire an estimated 5,000 additional security employees and would \nmake the NRC one of the largest law enforcement/security agencies in \nthe country--larger than the Secret Service or the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco and Firearms. By doubling or tripling the workforce of the NRC, \nthe legislation could change the agency's primary mission from that of \nprotecting public health and safety to providing for the general \ndefense of the country.\n    <bullet> Reducing the stringent screening requirements for security \npersonnel. Requiring security forces at nuclear facilities to be \nfederal employees likely would reduce the strict hiring standards, \nextensive background checks, training and ongoing performance reviews \nalready in place for private security forces. In fact, many Department \nof Energy nuclear facilities have private security forces, as do \nfederally operated nuclear plants, such as the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority reactors. The qualifications outlined in the Reid-Markey \nlegislation are less stringent than those already in place in the \nindustry.\n    <bullet> Squandering vital experience. Replacing private nuclear \nplant security forces with federal personnel with little or no \nexperience at nuclear power facilities would set aside years of on-the-\njob experience gained through countless security exercises and NRC-\nmanaged drills. Moreover, such a transition raises serious contractual \nissues regarding existing security forces.\n    <bullet> Misallocating vital and limited federal security \nresources. Nuclear power plants are already among the most secure \nprivate facilities in the country, while other components of the \nnation's critical infrastructure may require greater protection. Only \nthrough a comprehensive review of critical infrastructure security \nneeds can policymakers balance the available resources with the wide \nspectrum of legitimate security needs. Coordinating the efforts of \nfederal agencies to conduct a comprehensive threat assessment will \navoid having regulatory and security decisions made in a political \nvacuum without necessary guidance from government experts in security \nand intelligence gathering.\n    <bullet> Blurring the line between providing national defense and \nmaintaining industrial security. By placing the burden of providing for \nthe common defense solely upon consumers of nuclear energy, the Reid-\nMarkey proposal undermines both national security and energy diversity.\n    <bullet> Reducing economic stability and environmental well-being. \nNuclear power provides economic stability to our nation's consumers and \nindustries by providing a reliable source of electricity at a low cost. \nBy discouraging its use, the legislation erodes that stability and \nconstrains an essential source of electricity that does not produce \ngreenhouse gases or other air pollutants.\n    <bullet> Breaching the line between civilian law enforcement and \nmilitary force. By placing the command of a military-like force--\nconsisting of more than 5,000 personnel--in the hands of an independent \nU.S. agency, the legislation obfuscates the clear historical line \nbetween civilian and military responsibilities."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    The federal requirements for security at our nation's nuclear power \nfacilities are designed to provide a high assurance that the nuclear \npower plants are protected from radiological sabotage. Rigorous \nrequirements, coupled with industry commitment and strong NRC \noversight, have resulted in well-designed paramilitary security \nprograms at our nation's nuclear plants. These plants have multi-\nlayered security programs that effectively combine engineered physical \nsecurity features, administrative controls, and a highly trained and \nequipped security response force.\n    Employment requirements for security force personnel are quite \nextensive, with specific requirements for employment suitability, \nmedical qualifications, physiological requirements and physical \nfitness.\n    They are also very specific and detailed with respect to training \nand qualification. Security officers are required to complete training \nin more than 70 security-related areas, including weapons training, \ntactical response force operations, use of deadly force, and the \nsearching of vehicles, packages and personnel. Security force personnel \nmust requalify every year. In addition to the performance requirements, \nsecurity officers must re-qualify each year on the employment \nsuitability, physical, psychological and physical fitness requirements.\n    The security force weapons and equipment regulations are also \nextensive and formidable. Armed security personnel are required to be \nproficient with semiautomatic rifles, shotguns and semiautomatic \npistols or revolvers. They also are required to have available tactical \nresponse equipment such as tactical helmets, body armor, gas masks, \ntear gas, night vision equipment and portable radios.\n    The NRC's security regulations specifically require that each \ncompany operate, develop and maintain a well-designed security response \nplan for its facility. The response plans must be reviewed and approved \nby the NRC prior to being implemented. Finally as part of the response \nplan, the security force is required to develop a strong liaison with \nlocal law enforcement to ensure effective coordination of response.\n    NRC security requirements have resulted in the development of \nhighly professional security programs and security forces at our \nnation's nuclear power plants:\n    1. The nuclear energy industry employs more than 5,000 trained \nnuclear security professionals.\n    2. On average, each facility employs 80 nuclear security officers \ndedicated to protecting the nuclear facility against the threat of \nradiological sabotage.\n    3. Approximately 67 percent of the industry's security officers \nhave prior military, law enforcement or industrial security experience.\n    4. More than 17 percent have a college degree.\n    5. Nuclear security officers are well-paid professionals, with an \naverage annual salary of $35,000.\n    6. Job satisfaction for the security officers is extremely high, as \ndemonstrated by a retention rate of 90 percent.\n    7. Training for a new security officer is extensive. On average, a \nnuclear security officer receives 270 hours of training prior to being \ndeployed to the security force.\n    8. The industry has a strong commitment to continuing training and \ndrills for security officers. On average, the nuclear security officer \nwill spend approximately 60 hours each year completing requalification \ntraining, with approximately 30 hours spent on anti-terrorist tactical \ntraining exercises.\n    9. Security officers also participate in considerable training \nactivities with local law enforcement agencies and emergency response \nagencies. At least annually, and in many cases more often, \nfamiliarization and coordination training is conducted with local law \nenforcement personnel and such organizations as fire departments and \nemergency medical organizations.\n    10. Physical fitness is an important requirement for security force \nofficers. Each facility's security program includes a physical fitness \nregime that effectively tests the cardiovascular fitness and endurance \nlevels of security force personnel.\n    11. In addition to security program duties, nuclear security \nofficers also perform a number of other critical safety functions for \nthe plant. These include plant fire brigade, plant fire watch patrols, \nemergency medical technicians for first aid responses, and designated \nemergency response plan actions."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","                   Industry Supports Security Changes"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    The nuclear energy industry took immediate actions to enhance \nsecurity in response to the events of September 11. However, federal \nlegislation is required to make improvements in some areas, such as the \nauthority to use automatic weapons where state laws preclude their use \nby nuclear security officers.\n    In fact, the industry has supported the NRC's repeated requests to \nCongress to enhance security, long before the attacks of September 11. \nCombining these long-requested authorities with additional actions \nsuggested by recent security reviews, the nuclear industry has compiled \nthe following list of industry-supported security improvements.\n    The nuclear energy industry supports legislation that would contain \nthe following elements:\n    1. The president, or his designee, should conduct a comprehensive \nreview of nuclear power plant security, including consideration of the \nentire spectrum of possible terrorist threats.\n    2. The NRC should determine if changes are needed in the criteria \nagainst which nuclear plant security forces must successfully defend \nthe facility--which is called the plant's design basis threat. Any \nrevisions to the threat against which plant security forces must defend \nshould be based on a reasonable expectation of the security \nresponsibility of the industry. As such, the review of possible \nterrorist threats against nuclear plants should determine whether the \ndefense against such a threat should be the responsibility of the \nfederal government or the company.\n    3. The NRC should be granted the authority to permit plant security \nforces to carry and use weapons commensurate with the plant's \nresponsibilities to respond to the design basis threat and to permit \nplant security forces to make arrests without warrants if and as \nnecessary.\n    4. A nuclear plant's security forces should be granted the \nauthority to use deadly force, if necessary, to protect the plant. This \nauthority currently is subject to varying interpretations of state and \nfederal law.\n    5. Federal law should be expanded to prohibit the unauthorized \nintroduction of firearms into facilities licensed by the NRC and to \nprohibit the sabotage of NRC-licensed or NRC-certified facilities.\n    6. Communications between nuclear plants, law enforcement agencies, \nand, when appropriate, armed services (including the National Guard) \nshould be reinforced, and consideration should be given to placing \nsecure communications equipment at each facility.\n    The costs of additional security--such as National Guard personnel \nand state police, which have been and may be necessary to respond to \nterrorist threats that are clearly acts of war--should be the \nresponsibility of the federal government or the states."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Which would provide more effective security at a nuclear power \nplant--a security force that is federally staffed or one that is \nfederally regulated? Is there a significant difference between the two \napproaches?\n    To answer these questions, the nuclear energy industry analyzed \nsecurity force effectiveness and identified 10 attributes of an \neffective security officer. These qualities are similar to those \nexamined by the NRC in 1976 when it determined that private security \nforces would be a more effective means of safeguarding nuclear power \nplants than federal guards. The attributes were evaluated to determine \nwhether a federal security force or a federally regulated force of \nprivate security officers would have an advantage for each attribute.\n    The results indicate areas where plant safety would be \ndisadvantaged by the use of federal officers. Of these, the most \nimportant is the introduction of a second chain of command. Who makes \ndecisions during an attack, and how well the security force is \ncoordinated with other activities on site, is extremely important in \ndetermining security force effectiveness. Two chains of command, one \nfederal and the other corporate, will significantly complicate \ncoordination. Plant response must be fully integrated during a crisis.\n    The industry's review raised other issues related to \nfederalization. A change to federally staffed security would disrupt \nexisting security during the implementation period. This disruption \ncould compromise nuclear plants' ability to respond to threats at a \ntime when the threats are believed to be greater than usual."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","               DETAILED DISCUSSION OF SECURITY ATTRIBUTES"
break,break,break,break,break
"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","1. Physical and Mental Fitness\n    Physical and mental fitness standards must be applied to applicants \nfor security positions and to security personnel already employed at \nthe facility. Security officers must meet stringent physical standards, \nbe free of psychological disorders and substance abuse problems, and \nmust undergo criminal background checks.\n    These standards should be appropriate for the expected duties. \nThus, standards for a checkpoint officer may differ from those of an \narmed responder. In both cases, standards would have to be set by \nfederal regulation. There are no generic federal standards that would \nautomatically apply to a federal guard force. Moreover, there is \nconcern that the myriad of civil service requirements may be an \nimpediment to maintaining an effective security force and achieving \nstandards as high as those now in the NRC's regulations.\n    Existing NRC regulations require:\n    Physical Qualifications.--Prior to employment, or assignment to the \nsecurity organization, an individual must meet the following physical \nqualification criteria:\n    1. A nuclear security officer must have no physical weaknesses or \nabnormalities that would adversely affect his/her performance of \nassigned security job duties.\n    2. The officer must successfully pass a physical examination \nadministered by a licensed physician.\n    3. Armed personnel must meet the following additional physical \nrequirements: (a) Vision: Distant visual acuity in each eye shall be \ncorrectable to 20/30 in the better eye and 20/40 in the other eye with \neyeglasses or contact lenses. Field of vision must be at least 70 \nhorizontal meridians in each eye. The ability to distinguish red, green \nand yellow is required. Loss of vision in one eye is disqualifying. \nGlaucoma is disqualifying, unless controlled by acceptable medical or \nsurgical means. (b) Hearing: Individuals shall have no hearing loss in \nthe better ear greater than 30 decibels average at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz, \nand 2,000 Hz with no hearing loss exceeding 40 decibels at any one \nfrequency. (c) Diseases: Individuals must have no established medical \nhistory or medical diagnosis of epilepsy or diabetes, or any other \ndisease that would adversely affect his or her ability to perform \nassigned duties. (d) Addiction: Individuals must have no established \nmedical history or medical diagnosis of habitual alcoholism or drug \naddiction. (e) Other physical requirements: An individual who has been \nincapacitated due to a serious illness, injury, disease or operation \nthat could interfere with the effective performance of assigned \nsecurity job duties must, prior to resumption of such duties, provide \nmedical evidence of recovery and ability to perform such security job \nduties.\n    Mental Qualifications.--Prior to employment, or assignment to the \nsecurity organization, an individual must meet the following mental \nqualification criteria:\n    1. Individuals whose security tasks and job duties are directly \nassociated with the effective implementation of physical security and \ncontingency plans must demonstrate mental alertness and the capability \nto exercise good judgment, implement instructions, assimilate assigned \nsecurity tasks, and accurately communicate as required by their job \nduties.\n    2. In addition, armed officers and central alarm station operators \nmust have no emotional instability that would interfere with the \neffective performance of assigned security job duties. This \ndetermination must be made by a licensed psychologist, psychiatrist, \nphysician or other person professionally trained to identify emotional \ninstability.\n    3. The company must arrange for continuous observation of security \npersonnel and for appropriate corrective measures by supervisors for \nindications of emotional instability of individuals in the course of \nperforming assigned security job duties.\n    Physical Fitness Qualifications.--Security force members must \ndemonstrate physical fitness for assigned security job duties by \nperforming a practical physical exercise program within a specific time \nperiod as described in the licensee training and qualifications plan. \nThis program must consider job-related functions such as strenuous \nactivity, physical exertion, levels of stress and exposure to the \nelements as they pertain to security duties.\n    Requalification.--At least every 12 months, security officers are \nrequired to demonstrate that they continue to meet the physical, mental \nand physical fitness requirements.\n2. Security Knowledge\n    Certain general knowledge of security procedures and skills is \nimportant, no matter what type of facility the security officer is \nprotecting. This includes use of equipment and weapons, general \ntactics, general procedures, self-defense and knowledge of legal \nauthority.\n    There may be a benefit to standardizing training through a central \nacademy or use of centrally generated training guides and material. The \nfederal government could do this, but the nuclear energy industry \nalready has a proven track record for developing standardized training \nprograms--notably for reactor operator training.\n    For a specific site, a security officer needs substantial local \nknowledge to be effective. This includes detailed knowledge of \nprocedures, strategies and the facility's physical layout. At a nuclear \npower plant, security officers also must understand plant operations \nand procedures, radiation protection and safety procedures. This \nknowledge is site-specific and precludes moving officers from one \nfacility to another without extensive retraining.\n    Although general security and facility-specific training is \nintegrated into an on-site training program, facility-specific training \ncannot be effectively integrated into a central security academy \nprogram.\n    Existing NRC regulations require:\n    Training Requirements.--Before performing security-related tasks or \nduties, an individual must be trained and must demonstrate that he or \nshe can perform these tasks and duties in accordance with the \nlicensee's documented training and qualifications plan. This training \nmust include knowledge of the threat conditions that must be deterred. \nThese include:\n    1. a determined violent external assault, attack by stealth, or \ndeceptive actions, by several persons;\n    2. well-trained (including military training and skills), dedicated \nindividuals;\n    3. inside assistance, which may include a knowledgeable individual \nwho attempts to participate in a passive role (e.g., providing \ninformation), an active role (e.g., facilitating entrance and exit, \ndisabling alarms and communications, participating in violent attack), \nor both;\n    4. weapons, up to and including hand-held automatic weapons, \nequipped with silencers and having long range accuracy;\n    5. hand-carried equipment, including incapacitating agents and \nexplosives for use as tools of entry or for otherwise destroying \nreactor, or features of the safeguards system; and\n    6. a four-wheel drive vehicle for transporting personnel and their \nhand-carried equipment or explosives.\n    Qualification Requirements.--An individual must be qualified in \naccordance with the company's NRC-approved training and qualifications \nplan before being assigned to perform security-related duties.\n    1. Educational development: Possess a high school diploma or pass \nan equivalent performance examination.\n    2. Criminal history: Have no criminal history that reflects on his \nor her reliability.\n    3. Age: An armed officer must be 21 years of age or older.\n    Security Knowledge, Skills and Abilities.--Each individual assigned \nto perform the security-related task identified in the licensee \nphysical security or contingency plan must demonstrate his or her \ncapability in the following areas:\n    1. NRC requirements and guidance for physical security at nuclear \nfacilities;\n    2. nuclear security officer's duties and responsibilities;\n    3. physical security system design and operation;\n    4. security access control system design and operation;\n    5. vehicle, package and personnel contraband search process;\n    6. self defense and weapons use;\n    7. adversary force capabilities, tactics, motivation and \nobjectives;\n    8. tactical response program design and operations; and\n    9. security contingency event response program.\n    Requalification.--Security personnel must requalify at least every \n12 months to perform assigned security tasks and duties for both normal \nand contingency operations--which include radiological safety, \noperating practices, quality assurance, industrial safety and fire \nprotection.\n3. Alertness, Motivation and Adherence to Requirements\n    Maintaining an alert security force capable of supporting long \nperiods of routine activity without any hostile activity is essential. \nTechniques used to maintain alertness include the integration of \ntraining and drills, rotation of assignments, and the introduction of \nvaried activity into the security officer's schedule. Officers need to \nbe involved in day-to-day activity without detracting from their \nability to respond to a threat. Involving a federal officer force in \nroutine plant activities would be a challenge. Yet it is very difficult \nto maintain a highly trained, motivated force whose only responsibility \nis to sit in a fixed position and respond when there is a terrorist \nthreat.\n    Motivation is a willingness to endure hardships in the performance \nof duty, to use force when necessary, and even to risk one's life. \nClose integration of the security force in plant operations helps to \nestablish those personal relations with other plant workers that are so \nimportant in providing continuous motivation. Under ideal conditions, \nthe security officer is protecting more than a physical structure--he \nis protecting a closely-knit workforce that operates the facility. \nInvolvement with those he is protecting at the plant and within the \nlocal community is a significant motivating factor.\n    Adherence to requirements is the willingness to enforce unpopular \nrules and procedures. This is a complex issue that must be fostered by \neffective management methods. The nuclear energy industry's strong \nsafety culture fosters strict compliance with rules and procedures.\n4. Legal Authority: Weapons, Detention, Search and Use of Force\n    Security officers must have clear authority under the law to detain \nand search intruders and to use deadly force, if necessary, to protect \npublic health and safety. They also must be equipped with, and \nauthorized to use, weapons and equipment that are adequate for the \nthreat and defensive strategy being used.\n    State laws vary in what they permit. In most states, civilian \nsecurity forces are restricted in the weapons they can use and in their \nauthority to detain and search intruders. These laws would apply \nequally to federally regulated and federally employed security \nofficers. Regardless of whether nuclear power plant security is \nfederalized, legislation is needed to establish the necessary authority \nin this area.\n    Existing NRC regulations require:\n            Weapons Training\n    Security officers who are armed to perform assigned security duties \nmust be trained in accordance with the licensee's weapons training \nprogram. Security officers must be proficient in the use of assigned \nweapon(s) and shall meet prescribed standards in the following areas:\n    1. mechanical assembly, disassembly, range penetration capability \nof weapon, and bull's-eye firing;\n    2. weapons cleaning and storage;\n    3. combat firing, day and night;\n    4. safe weapons handling;\n    5. clearing, loading, unloading, and reloading;\n    6. when to draw and point a weapon;\n    7. rapid-fire techniques;\n    8. close-quarter firing;\n    9. firing under stress; and\n    10. zeroing assigned weapon(s)."

A \ntransition to a federalized workforce would not improve this \noutstanding retention rate.\n6. Physical Barriers and Other Protection\n    Physical barriers to entry, electronic aids, plant layout, \ndefensive positions, and personnel protective equipment all enhance \nsecurity force effectiveness. Although these are major factors in \neffective security of a facility, they are not related to whether \nguards are private or federalized. However, these physical features \naffect the number of armed responders needed.

There are frequent conflicts between \nthe needs for security and free access of the plant for safe \noperations.\n    Existing NRC regulations require:\n    Physical Protection.--Vehicle barriers and/or other physical \nrestrictions must be provided as necessary to ensure that the protected \narea of the plant cannot be breached by a direct vehicular assault or \nby detonation of a vehicle carrying a bomb. All vehicles, personnel and \nmaterial entering the protected area must first be thoroughly inspected \nby security officers to ensure that no weapons, explosive or other such \nitems are brought onto the plant site.\n    Physical access to the protected area of the plant is controlled \nthrough the use of physical barriers, intrusion detection equipment, \nclosed circuit surveillance equipment, a designated isolation zone and \nexterior lighting. Physical access to the inner areas of the plant \nwhere vital plant equipment also is controlled through the use of \nphysical barriers, locked and alarmed doors, and cardreader access \ncontrol systems. The barriers are substantial enough to effectively \ndelay entry in order for effective armed response by plant security \nforces.\n    Within the protected zone, access to all vital areas of the plant \nmust be further protected. This access may be controlled by a security \nofficer or provided by computer-controlled ``key-card'' access systems. \nPlant employees must have a documented need prior to gaining access to \neach vital area.\n    Physical security plans must document the defensive positions and \ndelaying barriers used to enhance security force effectiveness.\n    Personnel Protective Equipment.--The following personal equipment \nmust be readily available for individuals assigned to security duties:\n    (1) combat helmet;\n    (2) body armor (bullet-resistant vest);\n    (3) full-face gas mask;\n    (4) flashlights and batteries;\n    (5) baton;\n    (6) handcuffs;\n    (7) ammunition/equipment belt;\n    (8) binoculars;\n    (9) night-vision aids, i.e., hand-fired illumination flares or \nequivalent;\n    (10) tear gas or other non-lethal gas;\n    (11) duress alarms; and\n    (12) two-way portable radios.\n7. Deterrent Image\n    The industry's security programs combine strong physical security \nfeatures with highly trained paramilitary security professionals. Both \nfeatures are highly visible and provide a strong deterrent to anyone \nconsidering attacking a nuclear power plant.\n8. Compatibility With Normal Operations\n    Nuclear power plant security forces are extremely well integrated \ninto the normal day-to-day operations of the facility. The security \nofficers and staff work closely with reactor operators and other plant \nstaff to help ensure the safe and efficient operation of the \nfacilities. For instance, during plant maintenance and refueling \noutages, plant management must be able to increase the security force \nto clear additional worker and vehicles into the plant protected area. \nThey must be able to balance the extra cost of those security assets \nagainst the increase in productivity associated with enabling more \nrapid access to the facility. In addition, basic industrial security \nmust be integrated into the security force responsibility on a \nredundant force is needed.\n9. Liaison With Local Officials\n    Close liaison with local officials is an integral provision of the \nsecurity regulations and, in fact, has been implemented effectively by \nthe industry. Efforts undertaken since September 11 are an excellent \nexample of the effective working relationships that exist among \nindustry security forces and their counterparts in local law \nenforcement.\n10. Chain of Command and Control During Crisis\n    Security forces also are extremely well integrated into the \nemergency operations of the nuclear facilities. During plant \nemergencies, particularly security situations, security forces work \nvery closely with the plant operating staff to help ensure the safe \noperation and, if required, shutdown of the reactor."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    Nuclear power plant security is a multifaceted approach that can \nbest be thought of as concentric rings, with security becoming tighter \nas one reaches the center.\n    The first layer of security is found at the ``owner-controlled \narea.'' This area includes all property associated with the plant. \nElectric companies generally patrol and control vehicle access to this \narea.\n    The second layer of security is in the ``protected area.'' Access \nto this enclosed area is strictly controlled. Unescorted access \nrequires a computer-coded badge issued by security personnel. Fences, \nbarbed wire, microwave detection equipment, cameras and other detection \ndevices prevent unauthorized entry.\n    The third layer of security, and most heavily controlled area of \nthe plant, is the ``vital area.'' This area contains the equipment \nessential for operating the plant safely and successfully shutting it \ndown in case of an unusual event. Security contingency plans are \ndesigned to protect this area of the plant."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","    The Atomic Energy Act and NRC's regulations are the basis for the \nindustry's approach to security. These guidelines and the industry's \ncommitment to safety ensure that nuclear power plants are operated in a \nmanner that protects public health and safety. Licenses issued by the \nNRC contain technical specifications that establish safety limits for \nplant operation.\n    The plant designs and physical features are the first line of \ndefense. By design, our plants provide multiple concrete and steel \nbarriers that protect vital safety systems and the reactor fuel from \nsabotage. These barriers begin with the fuel-rod casing, or \n``cladding,'' itself, and progresses outward from the fuel to include \nseveral-inch-thick steel that makes up the reactor vessel, a bioshield \nthat is composed of steel and leaded concrete, covered by a steel \ncontainment vessel, and capped by a several-foot-thick shield building \nwall.\n    Nuclear power plants also incorporate systems that are designed to \nprevent the type of accident that could cause the release of \nradioactive material into the environment. These include operating and \nsafety systems that ensure full redundancy for necessary supporting \nequipment, onsite and offsite power sources, redundant sources of \nemergency power, with additional redundancy in the emergency reactor \ncooling and shutdown systems."

"","","jeffords","Senator Jeffords","     Conclusion: No Clear Advantage to Federalizing Security Forces\n    The Nuclear Energy Institute believes that the continued use of \nprivate security forces that meet strict federal standards provides \ngreater security at nuclear power plants than replacing these \nestablished, well-trained forces with teams of federal officers, as \ncontemplated by legislation proposed in both the U.S. Senate and House \nof Representatives.\n    Force effectiveness depends upon personal qualities and actions \nthat are prescribed by standards, regulations or policies essentially \nindependent of the officer's federal or private status. For example, \nNRC regulations equally applicable to federal or private officers \nspecify physical and mental requirements, criminal background checks, \ntraining, weaponry and duties. Based on established effectiveness \ncriteria, there is no clear advantage to a federal security force. But \nthere are significant disadvantages.\n    NEI's findings confirm the results of the original NRC study (NUREG \n0015, 1976) used to support rulemaking that established the existing \nuse of federally regulated private nuclear security forces.\n    Security is enhanced by stability. The current officer forces are \nwell trained and familiar with existing plant-specific security plans, \nthe facility, local law enforcement agencies, the local geography and \nthe local community. Federalizing the nuclear security officers likely \nwould result in major changes to the current security force. This would \nseverely disrupt the current organizational structure and effectiveness \nof the force. New security officers would require extensive training \nand orientation. This is particularly imprudent in a time of heightened \nhomeland security."
