"skelton","Mr. Skelton","","","    Mr. Chairman, thank you. This is a very \nimportant hearing. We will listen very closely to your thoughts \nand recommendations. We do know some of them and appreciate you \nbeing with us. We are somewhat at a disadvantage because we \nonly received the Administration's proposed budget legislation \nlate yesterday afternoon, although we have talked about these \nissues for quite some time. It is critical to look at the words \non the page and how each approaches include or are pieced \ntogether.\n    And Mr. Bradbury, from you I would like to know why in the \nworld it took so long for this proposal to get to us. We have \nbeen talking about it for some time. We have been waiting to \nassist the President, provide him with important tools. It is \nterribly important that we pass some. In light of the Hamdan \ndecision we can't go on in limbo. We must protect our troops \nand front line. We must be as stern and yet as fair as \npossible.\n    One approach would be for the war military commissions as \nthey exist under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), \nwhich is mentioned in UCMJ, or is this a proposal of a new kind \nfor a new court under military jurisdiction? Unlike other \nspecialized courts such as the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act (FISA) court that is in existence, although \nnot in use as we know, a couple of key principles to evaluate \nthis is will this allow us to quickly and successfully \nprosecute terrorists? Will this system meet the requirements \nclearly laid out in by the Supreme Court in the Hamdan case? \nHow closely does it adhere if we take this approach to the \nUniform Code of Military Justice and does it rigorously \nmaintain standards that protect American forces on the \nbattlefield?\n    Well, gentlemen, we are looking forward to your views. We \nlook forward to your thoughts on how the proposed legislation \nis enshrined in the Geneva Convention, including Common Article \n3, but like I say, the most important thing is to protect our \ntroops on the battlefield, to have swift justice and as only \nAmericans can give fair justice.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman. And Mr. Bradbury, why \ndon't you tee this thing up for us and tell us about the \nAdministration's proposal?"

"","","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    Mr. Bradbury. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member \nSkelton and distinguished members of this committee.\n    The President announced yesterday that 14 senior members of \nal Qaeda had been transferred to the U.S. Naval Base at \nGuantanamo Bay. These men include those who orchestrated the \nmurders of nearly 3,000 Americans on 9/11, the attack on the \nUSS Cole, and the bombings of the American embassies in Kenya \nand Tanzania. In U.S. custody these individuals provided \nintelligence invaluable in the war on terror that has prevented \nattacks on the United States and saved American lives. As the \nPresident stated, the time now has come for the United States \nto prosecute these and other terrorists for the atrocities of \n9/11 and their own war crimes.\n    Yesterday the President sent to Congress a Military \nCommission bill that will permit us to bring these terrorists \nto justice before fair and effective tribunals. This \nlegislative proposal reflects the outcome of two months of \nintensive discussions within and across the executive branch \nand between the political branches of government. We have \nconsulted extensively with Members of Congress and their \nstaffs. These discussions have been equally extensive, even \nmore so, within the Administration and have included input from \nthe military lawyers in all branches of the armed services, \nincluding the TJAGs who are here today. They and their people \nhave been active participants in our deliberations and many of \ntheir comments have been incorporated into the draft now before \nCongress.\n    The proposed legislation would enact a new Code of Military \nCommissions modeled on the courts-martial procedures of the \nUniform Code of Military Justice, or the UCMJ, but adapted for \nuse in the special context of military commission trials.\n    These military commission procedures would provide for \nfundamentally fair trials. The accused will know the charges \nagainst him. He will be presumed innocent until proven guilty \nbeyond a reasonable doubt. He will have a right to counsel, \nincluding an appointed military defense counsel, and the \nability to retain private counsel. He will be given a \nreasonable opportunity to obtain witnesses and other evidence, \nincluding evidence in the possession of the government. The \nprosecution will be required to disclose exculpatory evidence, \nevidence known to it. The accused will have the right to cross-\nexamine witnesses who testify for the prosecution. He will have \nthe right not to testify against himself. Evidence may be \nadmitted only if the military judge finds that it would have \nprobative value to a reasonable person, and it must be excluded \nif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the \ndanger of unfair prejudice. The accused will have the right to \nat least two appeals from any conviction, including an appeal \nto an Article 3 court, and he may not be tried a second time \nfor the same offense.\n    The new Code of Military Commissions would differ in \nsignificant respects from the military commission procedures \nestablished by the Administration before Hamdan. The presiding \nofficer would be a certified military judge with the \ntraditional authority of the judge to make final rulings at \ntrial on law and evidence, just as in courts-martial. The \nminimum number of commission members would be increased to five \nfrom three. In death cases we would require a minimum of 12 \nmembers who would have to vote unanimously before a death \nsentence could be imposed.\n    While the President's legislation tracks the UCMJ, in many \nrespects it departs from court-martial procedures where \napplying them would be inappropriate or impractical. For \ninstance, we do not incorporate into the legislation the UCMJ's \nMiranda type protections for U.S. military personnel. Nor do we \nincorporate the pre-charging investigation under Article 32. \nTerrorists are not entitled to these protections, which might \nfrustrate interrogations vital to our national security.\n    The draft legislation also provides for the introduction of \nall probative and reliable evidence, including hearsay \nevidence. Military commissions must try crimes based on \nevidence collected everywhere from the battlefields in \nAfghanistan to foreign terrorist safe houses, and therefore \nthey can not apply the strict rules of evidence appropriate for \npeacetime or court-martial trials.\n    The draft legislation also provides that under very limited \ncircumstances classified evidence may be considered by the \ncommission outside the presence of the accused. In the midst of \nthe current conflict, we cannot share with captured terrorists \nthe highly sensitive intelligence relevant to some military \ncommission prosecutions. We believe it critical to ensure that \nmilitary commissions have the discretion to admit classified \nevidence not shared with the accused in extraordinary \ncircumstances.\n    The circumstances for exclusion will be detailed and \nnarrowly defined, and the military judge will be required to \nfind that exclusion is necessary and consistent with the \naccused's rights to a fair trial. These will not be trials in \nabsentia. These procedures, properly administered by the \nmilitary judge, would strike the appropriate balance between \nsafeguarding our Nation's secrets and ensuring a fair trial of \nthe accused.\n    The legislation submitted by the President, Mr. Chairman, \nalso addresses, as you stated, the Supreme Court's ruling that \nCommon Article 3 applies to our armed conflict with al Qaeda. \nThe United States has never before applied Common Article 3 to \na conflict with international terrorists. Common Article 3 \ncontains certain vague prohibitions, including a prohibition \non, quote, outrages upon human dignity, in particular \nhumiliating and degrading treatment. These terms are \nsusceptible of uncertain and unpredictable application, and the \nSupreme Court has stated that courts may look to international \ntribunals in interpreting these terms. Therefore, without \nclarification the meaning of Common Article 3, which is the \nstandard that now applies to the conduct of U.S. personnel in \nthe war on terror, would be informed by the evolving \ninterpretations of tribunals and governments outside the United \nStates. This will create unacceptable uncertainty for U.S. \npersonnel, both military and intelligence personnel, who handle \ndetainees in the war on terror.\n    Let me be clear, as the President stated yesterday, the \nUnited States does not torture and the President has not and \nwill not authorize torture. The President also supports and the \nUnited States is committed to complying with the McCain \nAmendment to the Detainee Treatment Act, which prohibits cruel, \ninhumane, and degrading treatment as defined in U.S. law by \nreference to our own constitutional standards.\n    Because the standards governing the treatment of detainees \nby United States personnel should be certain and defined \nclearly by U.S. law, the President's legislation would define \nour obligations under Common Article 3 by reference to the U.S. \nconstitutional standards already approved by Congress in the \nMcCain Amendment. Congress rightly assumed that the McCain \nAmendment provided an acceptable and appropriate baseline to \ngovernment of the treatment of detainees on the war on terror \nand that standard fully satisfies United States obligations \nunder international law.\n    The Administration also believes that we owe it to those \ncalled upon to handle detainees in the war on terror to ensure \nthat legislation addressing the Hamdan decision brings clarity \nand certainty to the War Crimes Act. To that end, the proposed \nlegislation sets forth a definite and clear list of offenses \nserious enough to be considered war crimes punishable as the \nmost serious breaches of Common Article 3, including clear and \nserious outrages upon human dignity such as rape, sexual \nassault and conducting human experiments.\n    Mr. Chairman, I look forward to discussing these subjects \nwith the committee this morning, and I thank you and the \ncommittee.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Bradbury, thank you for a very concise \nopening statement, and gentlemen, the reason we have asked your \nattendance this morning is to reflect on and give us your \nevaluation of the Administration's proposals. So I hope you \nwere listening to what the high points or the important points \nespecially with respect to classified treatment of classified \nevidence and hearsay evidence. And if you would give us your \nthoughts on the Administration's proposal that would instruct \nus greatly.\n    So, and I just might comment. I was kind of surprised. We \nwent over--we have done some hearings on this area and when we \ndid the side by side and we looked at Nuremburg and we looked \nat the other tribunals, it occurred to me that the--that first \nI think a number of the members, myself included, were \nsurprised that hearsay evidence is allowed in varying degrees \nin these tribunals, but it also appeared to me that at \nNuremburg when we were trying the Nazi war criminals, we had \nthe advantage of thousands of witnesses in some cases who had \nparticipated in the capitulated government and were available \nto testify against Nazi leadership.\n    The war on terror in this case continues and many of the \nstatements that were linked, much of the evidence I would think \ninstinctively because I haven't seen the case against people \nlike Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who is thought by our intelligence \ncommunity to be the mastermind behind the strike on America on \n9/11, that much of the evidence that will be forthcoming in the \nnear term with these immediate cases that are going to be set \nup for prosecution and over the years will be evidence that is \nin fact hearsay evidence. It would also occur to me that a \ngreat deal of it is going to be classified evidence. So dealing \nwith those two areas, I think in a way that will allow us to \nhave an effective prosecution is going to be a major challenge \nfor us.\n    So just having said that, why don't we walk down the line \nhere and gentlemen, we are very interested in your comments and \nyour evaluation of the Administration's proposal.\n    General Black."

"","","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    General Black. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member \nSkelton, and members of the committee. I would like to thank \nyou for the opportunity to appear before you today and for the \ncommittee's timely and thoughtful consideration of these \nsignificant issues.\n    I would also like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the \nmembers and staff of this committee for your continuing hard \nwork on behalf of the Army's soldiers, civilians and family \nmembers. We really do appreciate what you do each and every \nday.\n    At the outset, I will tell you that military commissions \nare a necessary forum for the trial of enemy combatants \ncaptured in the Global War on Terror (GWOT). They are legally \nviable and pragmatically vital. They allow us to maintain the \nmaximum flexibility in coping with these combatants we find on \nthe current battlefield. Military commissions are well grounded \nin history and the Uniform Code of Military Justice and provide \nan indispensable tool to ensure justice under the rule of law.\n    The Hamdan decision has reinforced our need to ensure \nmilitary commissions are reflective of American values such as \ndue process and the rule of law. Our task has been to balance \nthe utility of the military commissions with these values that \nare foundational to our democratic society. We have been \nworking within the government to assemble a product that will \ndo this, that will not only protect this great Nation from \nthose who are committed to destroy it but that will \nsimultaneously uphold the principles that distinguish this \nNation from those who attack it.\n    We are prepared to work together with the Congress and look \nforward to being participants in the continuing developmental \nprocess. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I look forward to your \nquestions.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, General Black. For the record all \nstatements, without objection, will be taken, all written \nstatements will be taken into the record and feel free to \nsummarize your statements. Let me just ask our panel we \nunderstand that you are ready to work with the Congress and you \nfeel this is a--you have opinions on whether this is a good \nproduct or not a good product. We would like to hear that, but \nI would also like to hear your thoughts especially on these \narea of classified evidence, hearsay evidence, evidence \nobtained by coercion, some of these challenges that we are \ngoing to have to meet as we put this construct together. So if \nyou could comment on that, that would be greatly appreciated.\n    So Admiral MacDonald, thank you for being with us today."

"","","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    Admiral MacDonald. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking \nMember Skelton, members of the Armed Services Committee. Thank \nyou for the opportunity to testify today on the subject of \nmilitary commissions.\n    The Chairman. Before you start, let me ask my colleagues, \nwe are going to have other--if other members who are not \nmembers of the committee would like to sit in on either side of \nthe aisle, it is my feeling we should let them sit in and after \nour questions are finished, we should let them ask questions. \nWithout objection, let us let that occur. So ordered.\n    Go ahead, Admiral.\n    Admiral MacDonald. Congress' establishment of a legal \npermanent framework for military commissions, a Code of \nMilitary Commissions, would be a welcome addition to military \njurisprudence. My view is that existing court-martial rules are \nnot practical for the prosecution of unlawful enemy combatants \nnow or in future conflicts.\n    Yet our military justice model, the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice, can provide an appropriate starting point for \nthe drafting of commission legislation. We have been working \nwith others in the executive branch to formulate precisely such \na bill. I recommend that legislation establish the jurisdiction \nof military commissions, set baseline standards of structure, \nprocedure and evidence consistent with U.S. law and the law of \nwar and proscribe all substantive offenses.\n    The legislation should further authorize the President to \npromulgate supplemental rules of practice similar to the manual \nfor court-martial or in this case a manual for military \ncommissions. The legislation proposed by the President \ngenerally accomplishes those goals.\n    I and other military lawyers have worked with many others \nin the Administration to incorporate these ideas into the draft \nlegislation recently submitted before you. It reflects many of \nour comments, although there are some issues, particularly the \nuse of classified evidence, where I would stand by the approach \nto that taken by the Uniform Code of Military Justice. It is \nCongress, however, that will make the final decision on these \nissues. I am confident in so doing that we can achieve the \nnecessary and appropriate balance between affording an accused \nthe judicial guarantees recognized as indispensable by \ncivilized people on the one hand and/or valid national security \ninterests on the other.\n    Mr. Chairman, you asked that we comment on some specifics \nthat you talked about with respect to hearsay. It would be my \nopinion that the hearsay proposal that the Administration has \nforwarded is adequate as it currently stands in the draft bill \nthat you have before you.\n    With respect to coerced statements, it would be my position \nthat I would not--I would recommend that the committee look at \nnot allowing coerced statements, that the statements that are \nobtained under torture are excluded under the current \ncommission rules. However, statements obtained through coercion \nif they meet a reliability and probative test are admitted. I \nwould recommend that the committee look to the Detainee \nTreatment Act and the cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment \nstandard and apply that standard as well to statements that may \nor may not be coerced, and I would leave that determination to \nthe military judge in charge of the commission to balance those \ncompeting interests.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Okay. Thank you very much, Admiral. General \nDunlap."

"","","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    General Dunlap. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member \nSkelton, and distinguished members of the committee.\n    Major General Rives, the Judge Advocate General, is \ntraveling overseas. Accordingly, I appreciate the opportunity \nto appear before you today as this committee carefully \nconsiders the authority of the United States to prosecute \nsuspected terrorists, consistent with the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, and Mr. Chairman, with your \npermission I am going to summarize my statement.\n    The Chairman. Go right ahead.\n    General Dunlap. It will be in the record.\n    The Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Manual for \nCourts-Martial provided a superior starting point for \ndevelopment for a revised commission process and there will of \ncourse, as Admiral MacDonald indicated, necessarily be \nadjustments and changes from the manual and the Uniform Code. \nHowever, many of these processes can be readily adapted to meet \nthe needs of military commissions and at the same time meet the \nrequirements of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. The \nproposal submitted to Congress by the President reflects an \nattempt to adapt the UCMJ to the military commissions process. \nI personally support many, if not most, of these provisions.\n    A revised approach to military commissions is not only the \nright thing to do, but it also serves a pragmatic military \npurpose in helping us in the Global War on Terror.\n    Success in this war requires cooperation of many nations \naround the world, and addressing the Supreme Court's concerns \nabout military commissions will reaffirm our position on the \nmoral and legal high ground. A process fully compliant with \nCommon Article 3 will enhance our standing internationally and \nempower our allies to embrace the legal reasoning and \narchitecture behind the prosecution of military commission \ncases. Doing so is plainly in our warfighting interests. I look \nforward to discussing these issues with the committee.\n    Mr. Chairman, with respect to your specific questions I \nconcur with Admiral MacDonald in his view of the legislation.\n    With respect to coerced statements, I would say that every \ninterrogation is coercive to some degree and what we are \nlooking at here is unlawful coercion, and the concepts that \nAdmiral MacDonald indicated I think are the right ones to do. I \nwould leave it up to the military judge to determine in that \ncontext whether or not the interests of justice are served by \nadmitting the statement.\n    The Chairman. Okay. Thank you, General. General Walker, \nthank you for being with us today. The floor is yours."

"","","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    General Walker. Thank you, Chairman Hunter. Members of the \ncommittee, good morning. I want to thank you for the \nopportunity to be here today and for your committee's \ncontinuing interest in the military commission process.\n    Since the Supreme Court decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld back \nin June there has been a lot of discussion and debate on the \nfuture course of the commissions and of course yesterday the \nPresident announced a new legislative proposal. All the \nproposed solutions must achieve that delicate balance between \nindividual due process and our national security interest. We \nmust maintain our Nation's ability to deal with terrorists and \nunlawful enemy combatants, but at the same time we must also \nprovide those judicial guarantees which are recognized as \nindispensable by civilized people.\n    While we seek that balance we also must remember the \nconcept of reciprocity. What we do and how we treat these \nindividuals can in the future have a direct impact on our \nservicemen and women overseas. I have reviewed the \nadministrative proposal legislation submitted yesterday and I \nthink it does provide a solid foundation to achieve these \nbalances.\n    I personally remain concerned about any process which would \npermit the introduction of evidence against an accused outside \nof his presence. I simply believe the right to see the evidence \nagainst you and to be present when evidence is presented are \nfundamental to a full and fair trial and are also part of those \njudicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by \ncivilized people.\n    This may require in particular cases, I understand, that \nthe government would have to balance and then have to balance \nthe need for prosecution on a particular charge against the \nneed to protect certain classified information.\n    I concur with the comments of Admiral MacDonald and General \nDunlap as to hearsay evidence. I think that the proposals on \nhearsay evidence do provide adequate safeguards. They conform \nwith the accepted legal standards but also recognize the unique \ncharacter of the conflict we are in now and the availability of \nevidence and the availability of witnesses worldwide.\n    Like my counterparts, I look forward to working with \nCongress to create a system that will simultaneously help \ndefend our Nation from those who seek to destroy it but also \nuphold the values which have set us apart for over 230 years. \nThank you, sir.\n     The Chairman. Thank you very much. Colonel Reed."

"","","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    Colonel Reed. Thank you for the opportunity to come here \nthis morning and speak to you about this extremely critical \nissue. I do not have a written statement to provide. I was \nnotified late that I would be attending this hearing.\n    The Chairman. That may be good, Colonel Reed. Go right \nahead.\n    Colonel Reed. I am happy to answer any questions you have \ntoday. With respect to my opinion on the draft of legislation \nthat has been offered by the Administration and my discussions \nwith General Pace, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, I am \ncomfortable that the balance that is established in the \nlegislation meets the requirements of fundamental fairness that \nyou talked about at the beginning and also at the same time \nallows us to operate effectively on the battlefield. We feel \nthat the language in the legislation, the protections that are \narticulated in the legislation, particularly with respect to \nthe issues you identified, hearsay, coercion and access to \nclassified information, provide the appropriate balance as well \nas providing that stopgap safeguard of a military judge making \ndecisions based on the rules presented.\n    So I am happy to answer questions that you have today. \nThank you.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Colonel Reed. Gentlemen, let us \nget right to work and talk about practical aspects of this \nproposal.\n    If you have a defendant and the key information; that is, \nthe evidence that would convict him or her, is classified \nevidence, we have a procedure under UCMJ where you have \nattorneys, an attorney, a gentlemen or a lady wearing a uniform \nwith a clearance who can in camera, the attorney for the \naccused confronts that evidence, cross-examines with respect to \nthat evidence and treats that evidence. You have an opportunity \nat least through counsel to confront the classified evidence \nthat is utilized against you. If you have a defendant, an \nalleged terrorist who fires his government attorney and hires a \ncivilian attorney and the evidence that would convict that \nterrorist is classified and if you allowed the people or the \nprocess, the sources and methods, if you will, to be identified \nand to have that get out it would mean that people would die \nand that valuable information would be lost. And so you can't \ncompromise that classified evidence by giving it to the \ndefendant. Nor can you--nor can you compromise it by giving it \nto his attorney who does not have security clearances and \nperhaps has no interest in keeping that evidence secret.\n    What do you do? Do you--does the court--can the court \nappoint for purposes of confronting that classified evidence \nonly a court appointed JAG lawyer with the necessary \nclearances? Do you drop that evidence and in doing so dismiss \nor cause a dismissal of the case? What happens? What do you \nthink, Mr. Bradbury?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Mr. Chairman, one way to handle that is not \nto let the accused fire his military defense counsel, the \nappointed defense counsel. One way to handle it is to require \nthat all of these accused in these military commissions will \nhave an appointed military defense counsel who will have the \nnecessary clearances and will be able to get access to any \nevidence that is proposed to be used against the accused.\n    The Chairman. You have a provision like that in the \nAdministration proposal where you cannot because you rarely see \na case where you are not allowed to fire your counsel?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, we don't have a provision that \nexpressly satisfies that but we have a provision that makes it \nclear that each accused will have an appointed military defense \ncounsel, and it is envisioned that that is an essential part of \nthese procedures.\n    The Chairman. But it also allows for defendants to have \ntheir own counsel and I think you can imagine that some of \nthese high profile people, some of the people who are alleged \nto have participated in the attack on the United States at 9/11 \nwill have plenty of money available and will have civilian \ncounsel available and will be in a position at one point to \nwalk in and tell the judge that they want to get rid of their \ncourt appointed military counsel with the necessary clearances. \nWhat then?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, we would envision that you--it would \nnot be appropriate and is not a necessary requirement that you \nallow these accused to represent themselves in trials to turn \nin----\n    The Chairman. I am not talking about representing \nyourselves. I am talking about substituting out their military \ncounsel for their paid and perhaps very well paid civilian \ncounsel who do not have clearances and with whom you can't \nentrust highly classified information. What do you do?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Mr. Chairman, that is why we would require \nthat every accused get an appointed military defense counsel. \nIf he hires a private counsel he has a right to do that. If he \nhires a private counsel, we would provide that the military \ncounsel would be the associate counsel to the hired counsel. \nBut in the circumstances you described, it is precisely because \nof circumstances like that where it is essential for these \nprocedures to work in an orderly and efficient fashion and in a \nfair fashion that there be a counsel appointed by the military \nthat is cleared in and has the ability to treat all of that \nevidence and handle these matters, and it just has to be that \nway in my view.\n    In addition, I would quickly point out in addition to that, \nin the proposal we have put forward there are many procedural \nhurdles, requirements, and limitations that would have to be \nmet before any classified evidence would be considered by the \nmilitary commission outside the presence of the accused. Lots \nof procedural hurdles and findings the military judge would \nneed to make. Alternatives would need to be explored such as \nthe use of summaries or substitutes, et cetera, and in all \ncases there would be at least one military counsel or private \ncounsel that would get access to that information. So it is \nlimited to extraordinary circumstances, and I think that is the \nbest way to approach it.\n    The Chairman. If we placed in the legislation a provision \nthat said that at all times the accused must have a defense \ncounsel with sufficient security clearances to participate in \nany proceeding, especially with respect to this classified \nevidence, including ex parte or an in camera presentation with \nrespect to classified information, would that be--would that \ngive any value added to this proposal?\n    Mr. Bradbury. That would be acceptable and may be a good \nidea, yes.\n    The Chairman. You have laid out how the Administration \nproposes to deal with this classified information. Let us walk \ndown the line here.\n    General Black, what do you think?\n    General Black. Yes, sir. You have hit on the real key issue \nhere, the balance between protecting our national interests and \nour security and skill providing a full and just trial for \nthese unlawful combatants. As Mr. Bradbury said, the proposed \nlegislation does indeed contain a great number of safeguards in \nthis process, many of which mirror what we have in Military \nRule of Evidence 505 that you alluded to earlier. And I commend \nthe Department of Justice and all of the people that have \nworked on this in terms of getting this as far as we have. We \nreally have strengthened the procedures and we can be quite \nproud of that.\n    I remain concerned about a couple of things, though, and I \nwould add a little bit to this package with respect to the \nintroduction of classified evidence.\n    The Chairman. Go right ahead.\n    General Black. I am concerned, one, that the package does \nnot contain a provision that would prohibit the admission of \nevidence outside of the presence of the accused when that \nevidence is the sole evidence admitted to establish a material \nfact. If you follow. If it is the only piece of evidence that \nis necessary to convict, then I remain concerned about \nexcluding the accused.\n    The Chairman. Now let me ask you on this point. If you \nhave--let us take a hypothetical situation--a person hands a \npiece of prohibited information or secret information in \nfurtherance of a terrorist plot over the fence to a fellow \nterrorist at a--let us say at a military base, an American \nagent who is undisclosed sees that. He is a trusted agent. He \nknows the people. He sees the hand-off and yet the last thing \nyou want to do is to reveal that agent's identity. According to \nwhat you have just said--and that is the only piece of evidence \nthat you have that would convict this particular person, yet it \nseems to be highly reliable and the person who sees it is a \nmember of the Armed Forces and he knows the parties who make \nthe hand-off. But according to what you have just said, you \nwould drop the case against that alleged terrorist on the basis \nthat you don't want to--that you don't want to prevent him from \nconfronting his accuser who in this case can't be confronted \nbecause he is an agent. Is that what you are saying?\n    General Black. No, sir. I am saying you would drop that \npiece of evidence.\n    The Chairman. But I want to pin you down here, General. \nThat is the only piece of evidence that you have. You know, \nsome of these acts of complicity in terrorist operations or \nplots are very small pieces. The guy that drives the car, the \nguy that delivers the document, and you don't have in many \ncases other broad evidence. And yet that obviously is very \nprobative. If in fact you see that person is seen by an \nAmerican agent handing off a document which furthers a plot to \nkill Americans, that is obviously very probative. That is \nenough to convict him and yet if you are saying that if that is \nthe only piece you have, you have to let him walk. Is that \nright?\n    General Black. If you get to the end of that trail, you do. \nYou are skipping the safeguard that we already have put in \nplace and we have a number of mechanisms that have been drawn \nby 505 summarization of the evidence, alternative forms of \ntestimony or alternative forms of evidence that comes in to \nprovide the same kind of information so that the case can go \nforward. I think if you get to that trail and you have gone \nthrough all of those things and the military judge has \ndetermined that it is still probative, I think then you have to \nexclude the evidence if the accused is not allowed to see it.\n    The Chairman. Please understand, in the hypothetical I am \ngiving you there isn't additional evidence and if you can--if \nyou say a summary of the evidence, summary of the evidence does \nnot amount to face-to-face confrontation by a defendant or his \nattorney. So I know I am asking the tough questions, the \nproblem is the tough questions are the ones that are going to \narise when we put this system in place. You are saying that if \nyou had that one piece of probative evidence itself based on an \nagent's statements whose identity we can't disclose that and \nyou would drop that case rather than allow an in camera \nexamination by a cleared court appointed military counsel; is \nthat what you are saying?\n    General Black. I believe the accused should see that \nevidence. In the example you provided, I believe the accused \nshould see that. I would add one additional protection. I would \nadd a jury instruction. I think the members of the commission \nwith evidence that the accused has not been allowed to see, \nassured we get that far, I believe that the members of the \ncommission should be advised that the accused has not seen that \nevidence, has not had an opportunity to confront that evidence \nand the members of the commission should be advised to accord \nappropriate weight to that evidence.\n    The Chairman. I understand that. Now that is assuming that \nwe have a rule that does allow for a conviction without the \nperson being able to see the evidence.\n    General Black. Roger, Sir.\n    The Chairman. But your position is if that is the evidence \nthat convicts that person it is a Khalid Sheikh Mohammed or \nanybody else should be allowed to personally confront that \nperson--maybe it is an American agent--and without that \nconfrontation should be--if that is the only probative evidence \nthen the case should be dropped.\n    General Black. If it is the sole evidence to prove the \nmaterial fact.\n    The Chairman. Fair enough. That is your position. Admiral, \nwhat do you think?\n    Admiral MacDonald. Yes, sir. I agree with General Black. I \nbelieve that is required under Common Article 3 as one of the \njudicial guarantees recognized as indispensable by all \ncivilized nations. I think that is so important in this context \nto get that balance right.\n    The Chairman. Okay. But let me offer you the caveat, \nthough. What the Administration apparently has offered and is \nthe idea that you would have, while Khalid Sheikh Mohammed \nmight not be able to see the identity of that agent and cross-\nexamine him, his attorney, a court appointed attorney, a judge \nappointed attorney who is appointed for that purpose of cross-\nexamining the nondisclosable information or nondisclosable \npersons would do that, would be allowed to do that cross-\nexamination, do that confrontation and examination. You are \nsaying even with that safeguard unless Khalid Sheikh Mohammed \nhimself got to see the agent then you would not move forward.\n    Admiral MacDonald. Yes, sir.\n    The Chairman. What is your answer?\n    Admiral MacDonald. I would not let it go forward. And part \nof the reason is the--as the commission rules are currently \nconstituted, the defense counsel cannot talk to their client \nabout the classified information either. So I think that they \nneed, the defense needs to be able to talk to their client \nabout the evidence that has been presented in your hypothetical \nif it is the only piece of evidence. What essentially we have \nset up is a commission where the accused is going to be \nexcluded from the entire commission process. If that is the \nonly evidence that the government is going to present, the \naccused won't be in the commission to hear any of the evidence \nthat is introduced against them.\n    The Chairman. Well, now are you conclusively sure that the \ncounsel could not communicate in any way to the accused about \nthe accusation. There may be aspects, there may be aspects of \nthe accusations of the evidence which are not classified.\n    Admiral MacDonald. He could communicate about those \nunclassified but in your hypothetical----\n    The Chairman. He couldn't disclose the identity?\n    Admiral MacDonald. He could not disclose anything that the \nmilitary judge determined was classified and necessary to come \nin. And if it was the only piece of evidence I would have \nserious concerns about preceding in a military commission under \nthose circumstances.\n    I would also add, sir, that even under the commission rules \nas currently constituted, there is a provision at the end under \nthis balance that is done under this 505 like rule that talks \nabout the military judge making a determination that the \naccused received a full and fair hearing. I can't imagine any \nmilitary judge believing that an accused has had a full and \nfair hearing if all of the government's evidence that was \nintroduced was all classified and the accused was not able to \nsee any of it.\n    The Chairman. Not the accused but his attorney?\n    Admiral MacDonald. No. I think the accused, sir. I think \nthat is what Hamdan, Common Article 3, at least four Justices \ncame out and said that they would view--that they view that as \na judicial guarantee and a fifth, Justice Kennedy, said he \nwould view with concern an attempt to exclude an accused from \nhearing the evidence against him.\n    The Chairman. Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And incidentally on \nthat one point under the UCMJ is that the--isn't that the--and \nwe have walked through this process several times about how \nclassified evidence is used in trials with respect to our own \nuniform personnel. Is that the rule that is in place under the \nUCMJ? In other words, if you are represented by Colonel Jones, \nwho is a JAG officer, and you have maybe that same scenario \nwhere you don't want to disclose something or it is classified \nevidence, do we have the rule that if that is the probative \nevidence in the case and the defendant is not personally \nallowed to cross-examine the agents or to see the agent and see \nwhat he is saying, then the case is dropped? Is that the rule \nunder UCMJ?\n    Admiral MacDonald. Yes, sir. There are a number of \nprovisions under 505--that is one remedy--is the government is \nput to the task of making a decision if the judge has said \nlook, the defense needs to see this evidence, it is material to \ntheir defense of their case, then the judge would make a ruling \nthat would say government, it comes in in all of its classified \nform and then the government at that point would step back and \nsay do we really want to proceed forward. So the government \nwould--could drop that particular specification under a charge. \nThat would be a possible remedy.\n    The Chairman. Let me ask you one further question there. My \nunderstanding is that in these ex parte or in camera \nproceedings you have JAG officers who have necessary clearances \nto see the classified evidence or a civilian officer who has \nthe necessary clearances. If you are telling me that the \ndefendant in all cases gets to see it anyway, even if he has no \nclearance or the case is going to be dropped if it is the only \npiece of evidence, why then is it necessary to give that type--\nto require that type of a clearance for his attorney? You see \nwhat I am saying? If a corporal, general is going to get to see \nthe evidence and he doesn't have the clearance, why is it a \nrequisite that Colonel Smith, who is his JAG officer, have that \nclearance?\n    Admiral MacDonald. But he is potentially--the defendant is \npotentially not going to see it. In that ex parte in camera \nproceeding under 505, the military judge listens to the \ngovernment counsel, the government counsel produces the \nevidence. If it is classified evidence, the government has to \ndemonstrate that it remains classified and the government \ncounsel then talks to the judge about this is how I intend to \nuse this. The judge in that case will look at trial to prepare \na redacted, unclassified version that could be used and could \nbe delivered to the defendant under 505.\n    The Chairman. Okay, fair enough. Thank you. And General, \nwell, let me first advise the committee. We have got the rule \ncoming up on the livestock bill, and I understand it is just \none vote. So why don't we go ahead and keep moving? We have got \na lot of work to do and we will go right on down the line here \nand let me ask, one of my colleagues can whip over and get that \nvote. We will keep moving here.\n    Dr. Snyder. Mr. Chairman, I am sorry. I understand your \nwanting to keep it moving, but, I mean, those--I think most of \nus will go vote and we are going to miss minutes of this \ndiscussion. Will you at least give us five minutes?\n    The Chairman. Let us have a show of hands. How many folks \nwant to keep going? How many folks? Put your hand up. How many \nfolks would like to take a break and come back in 10 minutes or \nso? Okay, we will take a break, and General Dunlap, we will \ncome back and we will resume with you.\n    On to the livestock vote.\n    Okay, folks, we will fire back up.\n    And, General Dunlap, you have--you have listened to the \npreceding comments and know the issue. What is your take here?\n    General Dunlap. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A couple points I \nwanted to add to this conversation: one, this is a great \ndemonstration of democracy in action that you have invited this \nkind of debate. I very much appreciate it. Thank you, sir.\n    Just the proposal by the Administration does require \ncivilian counsel to be eligible for security clearances. And \nwhen we talk about the procedures for the admission of \nevidence, the 505 procedure under the military rules of \nevidence that we use at courts-martial is a process by which \nthe military judge examines the classified material, sees if it \ncan be summarized, redacted in some way, and the accused is not \npresent during that process.\n    The issue that I think is--once you get, for example, a \nredacted or summarized version of the testimony--and in the \nmilitary commission process you don't have the confrontation \nissues that you would necessarily have in a court-martial \nbecause hearsay is generally allowed. What goes to the members, \nthe finders of fact, must be presented to the accused, in my \njudgment.\n    In other words, I don't believe that we ought to have a \ntrial where, for example, the entire evidence is not presented, \nthat is, presented to the finders of fact the accuser never \nsees, so--but that is distinct from the preliminary process \nwhere the classified is evaluated and an effort is made to \nsummarize it or redact it in a way so that sources or methods \naren't compromised, and that would be facilitated under the \ncommission process because of the liberal rules on hearsay.\n    The Chairman. Yeah. It would seem to me the problem is \ngoing to occur when it is cases of identifying people and \nallowing the accused to see who the agent is, for example, or \nthe unidentified person who may be of great value to our--to \nour intelligence apparatus.\n    General Dunlap. And--right, and a particular case, it may \nnot be necessary to have the accused see that person because it \nmay not be necessary for that person to be presented to the \nfinders of fact. In other words, you might have summarized \ntestimony or summarized redacted material down to an \nunclassified level.\n    The Chairman. But certainly you know that he is going to \ndemand, especially if he knows that the failure to produce the \nidentity and allow him to identify that person would result in \na dismissal.\n    General Dunlap. Well, even under the----\n    The Chairman. You understand that, General. There will be \nan aggressive demand.\n    General Dunlap. Absolutely, sir. We will see litigation on \nevery aspect of this no matter what kind of legislation we \nhave. Under the Military Rules of Evidence, we have what we \ncall ``pseudonym testimony.'' For example, individuals can \ntestify under a different name. The trier of fact will know \nthat that person is testifying under a different name, but that \nprotects the individual, provides another level of protection \nand the triers of fact are so instructed.\n    As I say, in the military commission process, there is an \nadditional flexibility because of the relaxed rules with \nhearsay, but my bottom line, my personal opinion, sir, is that \nwe cannot have a process whereby the finder of fact, not the \njudge, is deciding, but the finder of fact gets evidence that \nthe accused never sees and never has the opportunity to defend \nagainst because----\n    The Chairman. Even though his lawyer sees it?\n    General Dunlap. Even though his lawyer sees it.\n    The Chairman. Okay. Okay. Fair enough, General.\n    General Walker.\n    General Walker. Sir, I concur with my colleagues that if we \nget to a point where the sole evidence against an accused is \nclassified, he must be able to see that evidence; that is just \nessentially one of those elements of a full and fair trial.\n    I am not aware of any situation in the world where there is \na system of jurisprudence that is recognized by civilized \npeople where an individual can be tried without--and convicted \nwithout seeing the evidence against him. And I don't think that \nthe United States needs to become the first in that scenario.\n    I think though, sir----\n    The Chairman. Well, what if the held-back evidence, though, \nis not the testimony that he did such and such or that he said \nsuch and such or he moved a bomb from a certain place to \nanother place, but simply the identity of the person who saw \nthat even though his lawyer with a security clearance gets to \ncross-examine that person and sees the identity--in other \nwords, he would get the evidence surrounding the accusation, \nall of the peripheral facts would be known to the person \nhimself, to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, for example, but the \nidentity of the American agent, the person who conveys that, \nthat would be known only by his defense counsel. You see that \nas not acceptable? Because that is what we--we have got to get \ndown to tough cases here.\n    General Walker. Yes, sir. The key is not whether his \nattorney saw it. The key is whether the trier of fact saw that \nevidence.\n    The Chairman. No. Certainly the trier of fact sees it, but \nI am talking about his team. If he doesn't get to know the name \nof the person who testified, who gave this evidence, but you \nget to know the nature of the evidence, what it was--somebody \nsaw him carry the bomb, do some other thing--it is your \nposition that even though his attorney gets to cross-examine \nthat person in camera with this classification, unless he \nhimself gets to know the identity of the agent, then you can't \nmove forward if that is the sole evidence?\n    General Walker. If that is the sole evidence, yes, sir.\n    The Chairman. Okay.\n    General Walker. Because the key is the meaningful \nparticipation of the accused in his trial, not the \nparticipation of his attorney.\n    One additional point though, Mr. Chairman, is that in a \ncouple of discussions already, we have said if we arrive at \nthat situation, then prosecution must be dropped. In fact, I \ndon't think that is entirely accurate. The prosecution could, \nin fact, be deferred.\n    Most of the scenarios where we are discussing this \nclassified information would come down to scenarios where the \nclassification deals with means, methods or sources. Often the \npassage of time makes a difference in whether those remain \nclassified; and particularly with the unlawful combatants that \nwe are dealing with here, deferral of prosecution is an option. \nIt doesn't necessarily mean that if the government was unable \nto prosecute based on divulging the classified information that \nthe individual would walk free.\n    The Chairman. Okay. Very good, General. Thank you.\n    Colonel Reed.\n    Colonel Reed. Sir, implicit in what General Walker just \nsaid is the recognition that the unlawful combatants that we \nare currently detaining are, in fact, enemy combatants against \nthe United States and are being detained based upon that. I \nthink that is an important factor to recognize, that they are \nbeing detained, and those being detained at Guantanamo are \nbeing detained because they are combatants of the United \nStates, being kept off the battlefield.\n    With respect to your question on the issue of classified \ninformation and with respect to the points that the panel \nmembers have made so far and the question whether or not you \ncould ever have a situation where evidence is admitted against \nan accused where the accused is not seeing that evidence, in \nfact, there are circumstances where that happens. There are \ncurrently circumstances in the Uniform Code of Military Justice \nwhere, for example, an accused who has been arraigned \nvoluntarily absents themselves from the proceeding, or if they \nbecome disruptive, they can be pulled from the courtroom and \nnot have access to any of the evidence that is being presented \nagainst them.\n    Now, that does not go directly--that is a voluntary act on \ntheir part; it does not go directly to the issue that you have \nasked, but it does present a point where there may be \ncircumstances where the accused is not going to be present when \nevidence is being offered to the trier of fact. So then you \nhave to look at the current circumstances we find ourselves in \ntoday with respect to the enemy that we are fighting, how they \noperate, the need to protect the methods and sources that \nGeneral Walker talked about and determine, as you create a \nsystem that is fundamentally fair, whether or not you can then \nlimit their access to that classified information. That is \nanother one of those kinds of examples where an accused may not \nbe present when certain evidence is being offered.\n    The Chairman. Very good. Thank you, Colonel.\n    Mr. Bradbury. Mr. Chairman, may I just add a couple more \ncents?\n    The Chairman. Absolutely.\n    Mr. Bradbury. Thank you.\n    I would implore Congress not to prejudge these issues \nthrough black-and-white prohibitions in statute. I think it \nshould be left up to the military judges on a case-by-case \nbasis to protect the fairness of trials, and anything that we \nare talking about in this legislation would be subject to a \nfinding that the accused has received a full and fair trial.\n    And many of the procedures we are proposing are very \nsimilar to those in rule 505 of the Military Rules of Evidence \nthat would require the use of substitutes or summaries in lieu \nof classified evidence wherever possible, and the accused would \nalways get to the extent possible an unclassified summary of \nthe evidence that was presented.\n    But as Colonel Reed just said, the notion of presence at \ntrial I don't think is--it is clearly not an absolute in \ninternational law. If, for example, the safety of witnesses \nrequire it, the accused may be excluded from the trial. And so \nthe principle is not different from the protection of witnesses \nversus the protection of sensitive sources, methods and \nintelligence information in an ongoing conflict.\n    For example, in the Tadic prosecution before the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the \ntribunal decided that a witness--anonymous witness' testimony \ncould be taken. So as long as it was facially credible, they \nallowed witnesses to testify whose identities were concealed \nfrom the accused, and even from the accused counsel, and whose \nvoices were obscured and were even screened off.\n    So that is a form of evidence being taken outside the \npresence of the accused, and there the court, the tribunal, is \nthe fact finder, and it is also the court that made judgment \nthat the testimony was facially credible and the court knew the \nidentity of the witnesses involved, but the accused did not. \nAnd that was determined to be consistent with international \nstandards for a fair trial.\n    So principle--it is a different situation, but the \nprinciple is really the same. You are protecting the safety of \nintelligence information in the war versus protecting the \nsafety of individual witnesses.\n    And then just the last thing I would say, Mr. Chairman, is \nthe idea that there be some blanket prohibition on the use of \nclassified evidence outside the presence of the accused if it \nis the sole evidence on the material fact. Again, I wouldn't \nprejudge that, try to do that by statute. I think the accused \nwill always claim that every fact is a material fact, and these \narguments will be made, and as I think General Dunlap said, \nthey will be litigated. I think I would leave it up to the \nmilitary judges on a case-by-case basis to decide, so that the \nfairness of the trial is preserved and that in particular \ncircumstances, particular evidence is appropriate and in others \nit is not. And I would leave it to them and I wouldn't try to \nprejudge it.\n    Thank you.\n    The Chairman. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Bradbury.\n    The gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Skelton."
"skelton","Mr. Skelton","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    Mr. Bradbury, I am somewhat intrigued by your \ncomments to leave it to the judge and for us not to write basic \nrules by which trials are to be conducted. I am an old country \nlawyer, and we pretty much follow the statutes back in Missouri \nand I think it would be a good idea for us on major things, \nmajor items, to have a statute thereon.\n    Mr. Bradbury, let me ask you: Senator John McCain was \nquoted in The New York Sun as saying, ``I think it is important \nthat we stand by 200 years of legal precedence concerning \nclassified information because the defendant should have a \nright to know what evidence is being used.''\n    Do you agree or disagree with Senator McCain?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, I think the----"
"skelton","Mr. Skelton","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    No. Just agree. Do you agree or disagree? We \nwill get along much quicker.\n    Mr. Bradbury. I stand by the proposal in the \nAdministration's legislation which would allow for the \npossibility----"
"skelton","Mr. Skelton","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    You disagree with that statement?\n    Mr. Bradbury. If the statement means----"
"skelton","Mr. Skelton","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    I will read it again. Do you want me to read \nit again?\n    ``I think it is important that we stand by 200 years of \nlegal precedence concerning classified information because the \ndefendant should have a right to know what evidence is being \nused.''\n    Do you agree or disagree?\n    Mr. Bradbury. If the--I am sorry, Congressman. If that \nstatement means that there would never be a circumstance where \nclassified evidence could be used at trial and not--and the \nclassified evidence not made available to the accused, I would \ndisagree. But I would point out that we would provide summaries \nof the evidence that is unclassified to the accused; and then \nin that sense, the accused would have an understanding of the \nevidence that is being used against him, but would not see the \nclassified aspects of the evidence. His attorney would.\n    So his attorney would have a full opportunity to see it, to \nmake an argument based on it. So consistent with the full and \nfair trial, up to the military judge; and I don't think that is \ninconsistent with traditional or, as I say, with international \nstandards."
"skelton","Mr. Skelton","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    Do you agree or disagree with Senator Lindsey \nGraham quoted from The New York Times, ``I do not believe it is \nnecessary to have trials where the accused cannot see the \nevidence against them''?\n    Mr. Bradbury. In these limited circumstances, we do think \nit is necessary to have this tool available for these \nprosecutions."
"skelton","Mr. Skelton","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    You are disagreeing with that statement?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Again, if that statement means there would \nnever be such circumstances----"
"skelton","Mr. Skelton","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    It means what the English language says. Do \nyou agree or disagree with it? This isn't--this isn't----\n    Mr. Bradbury. I disagree that we should close the door to \nthis possibility. This is going to be an important aspect of \nour ability to prosecute in certain of these important cases, \nnot all; and not--and we are not talking about a common part of \nit. We are talking about in extraordinary circumstances.\n    We have to leave that door open, and I would just implore \nthe Congress not to close that door, and if that statement \nmeans the door should be closed to the use of that kind of \nevidence, then I think that is unacceptable.\n    The President has said, yes, as it was suggested, we could \nwait until the end of the conflict to prosecute or we could \ndrop the prosecutions. I think from the President's \nperspective, both of those options at this point are \nunacceptable."
"skelton","Mr. Skelton","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    Under your proposal, who would be the persons \ncovered by your language in this bill?\n    Mr. Bradbury. The persons who would be subject to the \nmilitary commission trial would be unlawful enemy combatants. \nThere is a definition in the bill that would include those who \nfight on behalf of terrorist organizations like al Qaeda, and \nit would be limited to unlawful enemy combatants who commit \nviolations of the law of war. So it would not apply to \nprisoners of war (POWs) or protected persons under the Geneva \nConventions, and the legislation would expressly stipulate that \nthose protected persons would be tried even for their war \ncrimes by courts-martial or other tribunals and not by these \nmilitary commissions."
"skelton","Mr. Skelton","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    How about those that violate human rights?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, some of the war crimes are also crimes \nagainst humanity, but what we are talking about here is enemy \ncombatants who have been engaged in supporting hostilities \nagainst the United States. So fundamentally we are talking \nabout war crimes and enemy combatants. This is a law of war \nparadigm."
"skelton","Mr. Skelton","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    May I ask you what I posed in my opening \nstatement? I know you have been working on this for quite some \ntime, but we just received this yesterday. Would you explain to \nthe committee why we didn't have it at least several days \nbefore?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, I can certainly say we have worked very \nhard, as I believe you know, Congressman, for two months on \nthis project, coming off the court's decision, and much of that \nwork involved consultations with the armed services and \nmilitary lawyers and the Department of Defense; and much, much \nwork was done, many changes were made in the legislation as it \nevolved.\n    I think a lot of improvements were made. I think these \ngentlemen and their staffs provided terrific input that \nimproved the bill significantly. And in addition to that \nprocess, there was extensive consultation with various Members \nof Congress and their staffs.\n    I walked through proposals, draft language with members and \nwith staff and took suggestions, and the product continued to \nevolve right up until days before we submitted it. So I think \nwe have benefited from that continued work."
"skelton","Mr. Skelton","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    Did you contact any person on our side of the \naisle regarding this?\n    Mr. Bradbury. There were consultations, yes."
"skelton","Mr. Skelton","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    Now, you did not put this within the structure \nof the Uniform Code of Military Justice; is that correct?\n    Mr. Bradbury. It actually is modeled closely on----"
"skelton","Mr. Skelton","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    No, no, no, no. I am not talking about \nmodeled. I am talking about within the structure of the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice.\n    Mr. Bradbury. We adopted the structure of the Uniform Code \nof Military Justice for this Code of Military Commissions. So \nit does reflect almost the entire structure of the Uniform Code \nof Military Justice for courts-martial with certain key \ndifferences, as we have pointed out. But it would be--you are \nright, Congressman, it would be a separate code and a separate \nprocedure, because the President feels very strongly that these \nproceedings and these trials for enemy combatants, for unlawful \nenemy combatants should be kept separate from the court-martial \nproceedings that we use for our own troops."
"skelton","Mr. Skelton","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    I won't be short, but let me ask you just a \ncouple more questions.\n    The former detainees that have just been turned over to the \nDepartment of Defense, what is that--15; what is the number?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Fourteen."
"skelton","Mr. Skelton","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    Fourteen. The intention is that they be tried \nunder whatever law Congress passes; is that correct?\n    Mr. Bradbury. I think the intention is that all of their \ncases will be reviewed for trial--for possible prosecution \nunder the military commission procedures that come out of this \nprocess. So we will seek to prosecute them. There is no \nguarantee that prosecutions will move forward.\n    They remain enemy combatants, and we will hold them either \nway, but the hope and the intent is that as quickly as possible \nafter legislation is in place, we will review their cases and \nmove them forward for possible prosecution."
"skelton","Mr. Skelton","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    Does your proposal include the protections \nunder the Geneva Common Article 3?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Yes, it does, Congressman. We think the \nprocedures for these military commissions would fully satisfy \nthe requirements for the Common Article 3."
"skelton","Mr. Skelton","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    Does it state that?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Yes."
"skelton","Mr. Skelton","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    Thank you.\n    The Chairman. Thank the gentleman.\n    The gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Saxton.\n    Mr. Saxton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Mr. Bradbury, as I read the Administration proposal, it \nseems fairly clear that the proposal would target not only \nmembers of the organization that we call al Qaeda, but it would \ntarget other individuals from organizations who are in the \nbusiness of carrying out asymmetrical warfare that we generally \nrefer to as terrorism.\n    Let me ask you a hypothetical question.\n    In the case of Hezbollah, which is clearly a state-\nsponsored organization and an organization that clearly targets \ncivilians, in the event that the U.S. captures a member of \nHezbollah--incidentally, an organization that has killed more \nAmericans than any organization other than al Qaeda--under what \ncircumstances, I guess is the question, could that member of \nHezbollah be tried under the military commission that you have \nproposed?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Congressman, I believe it would only be if it \nwere determined that Hezbollah is engaged in hostilities \nagainst the United States. Again, this is an armed conflict \nlaw, war paradigm, and it is clear that we are at war with al \nQaeda and its affiliates. So that would be--that is a \nprerequisite here, that you are in a--essentially, a state of \narmed conflict; hostilities are going on, or have gone on, and \nthe organization in question is engaged in or supporting those \nhostilities against the United States.\n    Mr. Saxton. I would suspect that if a member of Hezbollah \nwere to kill a United States citizen, that would constitute a \nreason that the tribunal could be used to prosecute that \nperson?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, I am going to hesitate to give a \nblanket answer on that. I think that, again, there would need \nto be a state of hostilities or have been a state of \nhostilities between the organization and the United States, and \nthe act of one person does not make a state of hostilities.\n    Mr. Saxton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Thank the gentleman.\n    The gentleman from South Carolina, Mr. Spratt."
"spratt","Mr. Spratt","skelton","Mr. Skelton","    Mr. Bradbury, from your testimony, I gather \nthat you don't believe that the detainees currently held can be \nadequately tried under existing law, including the Uniform Code \nof Military Justice.\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, Congressman, that actually is not a \njudgment for me to make. But I have talked to some prosecutors \nwho would likely be involved, and I think the strong view is \nthat we need flexible procedures, we need the type of \nprocedures that are reflected in this proposed legislation for \nmilitary commissions, and that some of the limitations under \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice for courts-martial are \nincompatible with that.\n    For example, speedy trial rights--some of these people have \nbeen held for a long time already. For example, Miranda \nwarnings that would give the accused a right to counsel from \nthe moment he is suspected of having committed a crime, would \nbe incompatible."
"spratt","Mr. Spratt","spratt","Mr. Spratt","    Case law rather than statutory law, isn't it?\n    Mr. Bradbury. It is reflected in--it flows from article 1 \nof the UCMJ, and it is reflected in the manual for courts-\nmartial."
"spratt","Mr. Spratt","spratt","Mr. Spratt","    Let me ask you this. The Justice Department \nissued a statement of facts on June 23, I believe, 2006, \nstating that it had prosecuted--brought to justice 261 \nterrorists or defendants engaged in terrorist-related activity. \nAre you familiar with that fact sheet?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Not very familiar with it, but I am generally \nfamiliar with the issue.\n    Of course, the Department has a Counterterrorism Section in \nits Criminal Division, and other sections of the Criminal \nDivision that are very, very focused on----"
"spratt","Mr. Spratt","spratt","Mr. Spratt","    My point is that these 261 were apparently \ntried or the cases were processed under the existing rules of \nevidence and criminal procedure, applicable in the U.S. \ndistrict courts; and by the same token under the UCMJ, we have \ncases pending now, battlefield cases where witnesses and \nevidence will have to be taken from the exigencies of the \nbattlefield and brought back to some court.\n    We have got these cases being tried now--have been tried in \nthe past successfully; 261 were prosecuted. How did you do it \nwith respect to these defendants?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, Congressman, obviously we will use \nevery tool at our disposal to fight this war, and sometimes \nthat means criminal prosecutions, many of those prosecutions \nare for--they are not for law-war violations, but for \ntraditional crimes. Some of them are crimes like immigration \nviolations, fraud, other things short of terrorism, because we \nwill use every tool we can to bring the terrorists off the \nstreets and if we can prosecute them for crimes, we will."
"spratt","Mr. Spratt","spratt","Mr. Spratt","    Has the Justice Department overstated the \ncharacter of these particular defendants? Have you called \npeople ``terrorists'' who really were----\n    Mr. Bradbury. No, I don't think so.\n    I think that there are a lot of people who, we have reason \nto know, are involved in plotting terrorist activity. What you \nwant to do is not wait until the terrorist act is complete \nnecessarily in every case and prosecute them for a complete \nterrorism crime; but rather, get them, prosecute them, put them \nin prison for any crime that you can prosecute them for if that \nmeans you are actually preventing a terrorist action from \nultimately occurring."
"spratt","Mr. Spratt","spratt","Mr. Spratt","    Let me ask you a bit different question because \nmy time is limited.\n    If you had this additional chapter to the UCMJ, and dealing \nwith and substantiating military commissions, I suppose you \nwill have to create the procedural rules that accompanied this \ntribunal, in addition, will you restate substantive law? And if \nyou do restate, reformulate, substantive law, is that an ex \npost facto problem here?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, in the proposal that the President sent \nup, all of the substantive offenses that would be triable by \nmilitary commission would be specified by Congress in the \nlegislation, and the Secretary of Defense would not have \ndiscretion to define new substantive offenses.\n    All of these offenses, we think, are offenses that have \npreexisted under international law, laws and customs of war, \nand the evolving notion of what is a war crime or properly \ntriable by military commission. We don't think there would be \nan ex post facto issue with any of them, and that is including \na crime of conspiracy, which we would specify to clarify that \nthat is a preexisting offense under the laws of war.\n    But to the first part of your question, absolutely, we \nwould anticipate; and it would specify in the legislation that \nthe Department of Defense would have to promulgate rules, \nincluding rules of evidence and other rules of procedure, for \nthese trials and would have to submit those to this committee \nand the Senate Armed Services Committee. Within a certain \nnumber of days after the legislation is passed, you would have \nan opportunity to review those.\n    We would anticipate that these rules would be, in effect, a \nmanual of military commissions, much as was described and just \nas exists for court-martial proceedings. There is a manual of \ncourts-martial, and in fact in a lot of respects it will look \nquite similar, I think, with certain key differences in some of \nthese areas that we have talked about today.\n    The Chairman. Thank the gentleman.\n    The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Conaway."
"conaway","Mr. Conaway","spratt","Mr. Spratt","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your \nholding this hearing today.\n    A quick look at the bill that is in front of us, section or \nsubchapter 6 talks about post-trial procedures. Can you explain \nto us the difference between the appellate procedures that you \ncontemplate under this bill versus the UCMJ; and also talk to \nus--it makes reference to a court of military commission \nreview, and also the court of appeals here in the District of \nColumbia. Can you form all that in to how it is going to work \nonce it is in place?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Yes. What is envisioned in this legislation \nis an appellate process that in some respects is quite similar \nto that for courts-martial and but in other respects is \ndifferent. It would create a court of military commission \nreview, which would be parallel to a court of criminal appeals \nthat hears appeals from courts-martial.\n    One key difference is, the court of military commission \nreview would only hear and decide issues of law on appeal, just \nlike a traditional appellate court that we are all used to in \nthe article 3 context, whereas for courts-martial of our own \ntroops, the court of criminal appeals in the court-martial \nprocess can review questions of fact as well as law, can \nessentially interpose a different view on questions of fact.\n    We don't think that is--that is not necessary, that--that \nis a procedural protection for our own troops that actually \ngoes beyond what is provided in article 3 courts for regular \ncriminal defendants. We don't think it is appropriate to \nprovide that level and not necessary to provide that level of \nreview and procedural protection here, but there would be a \ncourt of military commission review that could decide issues of \nlaw and overturn decisions of the military commission trial on \nquestions of law.\n    In addition, because the government would not have a right \nto appeal a judgment of acquittal from the military \ncommissions, the government, just as in traditional criminal \nprosecutions in article 3 courts, has to have a right of \ninterlocutory appeal to this court of military commission \nreview where, for example, the military judge has made a \ndecision to exclude key evidence of the government or has \ndecided a dispositive issue against the government. At that \npoint, the government needs to have an interlocutory appeal up \nto this court of military commission review.\n    Then, from the court of military commission review, which \nis in the Department of Defense, we would provide an appeal as \na right in all cases, from all convictions for the accused, to \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nCircuit--the D.C. Circuit, pursuant to the scope or the \nstandards of review that are in the Detainee Treatment Act that \nCongress already decided on and debated back in December; and \nthat is, the court of appeals can review whether the military \ncommission applied the correct standards and procedures and \nwhether the trial proceeding and the conviction were consistent \nwith the laws and Constitution of the United States.\n    And the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA) currently limits the \nappeal as a right to sentences that are longer than 10 years, \nor sentences of death; and if it is a sentence shorter than 10 \nyears, it is a discretionary petition for review under the DTA. \nWe would change that in this legislation and make it an appeal \nas a right from all convictions to the D.C. Circuit; and then, \nfinally, of course, the accused could petition the Supreme \nCourt for certiorari review from that.\n    So it is similar in some respects to the military \ncommission review process, but differs because of the Detainee \nTreatment Act. We think it is appropriate not to reopen that \ndebate, but to leave that review and those standards as set in \nthe DTA."
"conaway","Mr. Conaway","conaway","Mr. Conaway","    Thank the gentleman.\n    Mr. Chairman, thank you for the----\n    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman. The gentleman from \nTexas, Mr. Ortiz."
"ortiz","Mr. Ortiz","conaway","Mr. Conaway","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    You know, we are going through very serious times, critical \ntimes; and we see where some of the Coalition members have \neither withdrawn, quit in Afghanistan, in Iraq. Have we \nconsulted with our allies, those that have signed up in an \nagreement to what the Geneva Conventions do? And is this the \nright time to be doing this when we are in the middle of two \nwars?\n    Any of you that would like to answer that question.\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, I will jump in first.\n    There has been extensive consultation with our allies and \nthe Coalition members by the Department of State, the Secretary \nof State, the President about all aspects of the joint effort \nin this war on terror. I actually think that the State \nDepartment would probably tell you that our allies, by and \nlarge, will welcome a move toward military commission \nprosecutions for these enemy combatants.\n    I think it is probably fair to say that our allies have \nfavored that kind of treatment of enemy combatants rather than \na situation where there is less definition and certainty about \nwhat is going to happen down the road. I think they will also \nfavor generally the idea of a more elaborate and \ncongressionally determined set of rules for the military \ncommission process.\n    So I think there has been a lot of consultation on this, \nand I think this will be whatever Congress decides to do here; \nand once we get this process up and running, will probably be \nviewed as a significant move forward by the international \ncommunity, I think."
"ortiz","Mr. Ortiz","ortiz","Mr. Ortiz","    Would anybody else like to respond?\n    Admiral MacDonald. Congressman I would just say that you \nasked the question about, is this the right thing to do, \nconsidering we have--we are currently engaged in a war in \nAfghanistan and Iraq.\n    I think I would agree with the President's comment \nyesterday: It is imperative that we move forward on military \ncommissions. This is going to be a long war against terrorism, \nand we need--we need a set of procedures and rules to handle \nthe unlawful enemy combatants that we are taking off the \nbattlefield.\n    Colonel Reed. Congressman, I would also add that this has \nbeen shared and discussed with the combatant commanders, \nspecifically the geographic combatant commanders; and I cannot \nspeak to the discussions that they may have with the various \nrepresentative countries within the AOR, but generally \nspeaking, the combatant commanders uniformly follow on the line \nthat Admiral MacDonald just articulated."
"ortiz","Mr. Ortiz","ortiz","Mr. Ortiz","    One of the reasons that I ask is because the \nGeneva Convention has been there for many, many years; and all \nof a sudden, you know, we have to do something like this. Maybe \nit is needed.\n    What a lot of people don't understand is the perception out \nthere, and I just want to be sure that what we do is the right \nthing to protect our soldiers as well.\n    Admiral MacDonald. Congressman, I think it is the right \nthing to do. I think one of the things that nobody anticipated \nwas the Hamdan court's declaration that Common Article 3 \napplies in this conflict. I think nobody believed that these \ntypes of detainees, unlawful enemy combatants, would be \nafforded Common Article 3 rights.\n    We now have the Hamdan decision, the Supreme Court has \nspoken, and we need--we need to take action now to comply with \nthe Supreme Court's decision; and passing legislation on \nmilitary commissions will help us do that.\n    General Dunlap. I agree with that, sir. We need to go \nforward with the commission process. We need to do it right and \nwe need to have the right processes. But I do believe that it \nwill facilitate waging the Global War on Terror to be able to \ndeal with the detainees that we have through the military \ncommission process."
"ortiz","Mr. Ortiz","ortiz","Mr. Ortiz","    Thank you. I don't have any further questions.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Thank the gentleman. The gentleman from \nMinnesota, Mr. Kline."
"kline","Mr. Kline","ortiz","Mr. Ortiz","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, gentlemen, \nfor being here. Fairly confusing for those of us who aren't \nlawyers, don't watch enough TV to even pretend that we are.\n    But let me just--I will go to you, Mr. Bradbury, first, \njust very quickly, make sure that I understand. If this \nlanguage were to pass exactly as it is, the government could \nchoose when and if to bring somebody before a commission; is \nthat correct?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Yes."
"kline","Mr. Kline","kline","Mr. Kline","    So, in theory, someone could not be brought \nbefore a commission for years----\n    Mr. Bradbury. Correct.\n    Okay. Fine. If someone is brought before the commission and \nis found guilty, we have this appeals process that you just \nexplained to Mr. Conaway. If they are found not guilty, they \nare immediately released; is that correct?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Not necessarily. They remain enemy \ncombatants, and under the laws of war, we can hold them while \nthe hostilities are going on.\n    Now, that is not for punishment purposes. So there is a \nvery big difference, I think, certainly morally and in the \nsight of the victims of their war crimes between simply holding \nthem as combatants under laws of war and punishing them.\n    Punishment, of course, can include up to and including the \npenalty of death for depending on the seriousness of their \ncrimes. We are not in a position today to punish them for what \nthey have done. We are simply holding them to protect the \ncountry, but we have a right to continue to do that."
"kline","Mr. Kline","kline","Mr. Kline","    Even after they are found not guilty.\n    That sort of brings me to the point that the other \ngentlemen were talking about earlier. If you bring them before \na commission, and in the process you determine, the government \ndetermines that there is some evidence that they cannot use, \nthey can stop the process; is that correct?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, that--that certainly--if that is the \ncase, if there is evidence that is foreclosed from the \ngovernment's case that is critical or essential to the \ngovernment's prosecution, the government would be forced to \ndrop the prosecution as an alternative or await the end of \nhostilities, whenever that might be."
"kline","Mr. Kline","kline","Mr. Kline","    So the unlawful combatant would just continue to \nbe detained and the trial process would stop, at least for that \ntime under those circumstances?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Yes. But the victim's interest in seeing \nretribution done and justice done would be thwarted."
"kline","Mr. Kline","kline","Mr. Kline","    Exactly.\n    The Chairman. Would the gentleman yield on that?"
"kline","Mr. Kline","kline","Mr. Kline","    I would be happy to yield.\n    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman, because I think in his \nown talented way, he has gotten to--talked, reflected back on \nthis problem that we talked about earlier, this challenge.\n    What you are saying, Mr. Bradbury, is that if the \ngovernment has--if its major piece of evidence that would be \nnecessary for a conviction would require the disclosure of an \nagent whom we can't afford to disclose, at that point the \ngovernment would have a choice. The choice would be to try to \nproceed without the evidence.\n    But if it is apparent that it is not going to work, that \nthat is a central piece, they would--rather than disclose the \nagent, they could simply continue to keep the person as a \ncombatant, and the agent's testimony that, in fact, he saw the \nalleged terrorist undertaking actions which were indicative of \nhis combatant status, that certainly could be considered in \nterms of simply holding him.\n    Now there is obviously going to be--at that point you are \ngoing to have habeas filings, you are going to have all kinds \nof attempts by the defense counsel to--I would think, at that \npoint, to effect a release.\n    But if your answer to Mr. Kline's statement is, as I heard \nit, you could simply keep them warehoused, where they can't go \nback to the battlefield even though you can't proceed with the \nprosecution, is that accurate?\n    Mr. Bradbury. That is true, but we would--we would ask that \nCongress keep the door open for the possibility that that \nprosecution could move forward under strict limitations and in \norder to guarantee fairness, because, I think, as the President \nsaid yesterday, he views it as unacceptable that we would \nsimply have to warehouse them and hold them when we want to \nprosecute them. And in those cases where they have committed \nserious war crimes and we want to prosecute them, he thinks it \nis time to move forward, and then we have procedures that would \nenable us to do that."
"kline","Mr. Kline","kline","Mr. Kline","    Thank you.\n    I was going to reclaim my time, but I see it just went \naway. I had some trial language.\n    The Chairman. You go right ahead."
"kline","Mr. Kline","kline","Mr. Kline","    Let me just run this sort of trial language that \nwe have been looking at here--I have been looking at for the \nlast several minutes.\n    Going back to the issue of classified--we are really \ntalking about classified material here. If you put language in \nthat said, quote, ``The admission of evidence that has not been \nprovided to the accused that constitutes the sole evidence of a \nmaterial fact in issue does not by itself deprive the accused \nof a full and fair trial.''\n    That is--you know, that is why I am not a lawyer. I have to \nread this. But could I just whip down the line and get your \ncomments, whether that language would be acceptable or not \nacceptable?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, I am sorry, Congressman. Would that be \na statement in the legislation from Congress to that effect?"
"kline","Mr. Kline","kline","Mr. Kline","    Yes. Insert it in the legislation.\n    Mr. Bradbury. Or would that be a finding that the military \njudge----"
"kline","Mr. Kline","kline","Mr. Kline","    Insert in the legislation.\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, again, I guess I would say that I would \ndiscourage black-and-white rules being put in by a statute as \nto admissibility questions or questions like that. I would \nthink that the military judge, under the circumstances in a \nparticular case with a particular piece of evidence, may \nconclude that it is consistent with a full and fair trial for \nthat to be the sole evidence of a particular fact.\n    Now, the accused is always going to claim that every fact \nis material fact when it comes to that. At the same time, in a \ngiven case, the military judge may determine that it is not \nconsistent with a full and fair trial under all the \ncircumstances here for that to be the sole evidence of that \nparticular fact. And that should be the military judge's \njudgment, based on the circumstances, based on the evidence, \nbased on everything available to him; and it shouldn't be \nprejudged by Congress in statute. That is basically the message \nthat I am suggesting."
"kline","Mr. Kline","kline","Mr. Kline","    Okay. Thank you.\n    I see that the light is now bright red, so Mr. Chairman, \nthank you. I yield back.\n    The Chairman. Thank the gentleman.\n    The gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Taylor."
"taylor","Mr. Taylor","kline","Mr. Kline","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am going to yield to \nthe gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Cooper."
"cooper","Mr. Cooper","taylor","Mr. Taylor","    Mr. Bradbury, the last time you testified \nbefore this committee, I asked you about your quote that the \nPresident is always correct. And then you testified to this \ncommittee that you had been joking when you said that. I trust \nyou are not joking today.\n    Mr. Bradbury. I am not trying to be humorous. I think I \nlearned my lesson that last time."
"cooper","Mr. Cooper","cooper","Mr. Cooper","    What we and the American people are seeing \ntoday is one civilian Justice Department official, four JAG \ngenerals and a JAG colonel, and my constituents back home are \nmore likely to believe the four JAG generals and the JAG \ncolonel. In fact, trust in our uniform military is something \nthat I think we have not seen enough of from this \nAdministration, and all of the witnesses wearing a uniform have \nexpressed misgivings, concerns about the legislation. I wish \nyou had consulted them more in drafting this.\n    Today, in The Wall Street Journal, one of your predecessors \nat the Justice Department, John Yoo, is quoted as saying that \nbasically the bill you are offering Congress today is no \ndifferent from what you have been doing before. And how are the \nSupreme Court justices going to react to that, having \noverturned your procedures for the last 4 or 5 years, and here \nis the man who wrote those procedures saying, hey, what you are \noffering us is more of the same?\n    Mr. Bradbury. I haven't seen that quote, but I find that an \nextraordinary statement, really, because this 85-page----"
"cooper","Mr. Cooper","cooper","Mr. Cooper","    Let me read it to you. If you haven't seen the \nquote, let me read it to you.\n    ``it does not look like the procedures for these \ncommissions differ in any significant way from the rules \nalready in place before. The only difference is that the \nPresident is seeking Congress' explicit support.'' so in terms \nof the substantive law, Mr. Yoo is saying, no change. But let \nme get to some particular points here.\n    As our chairman began this hearing, our foremost goal \nshould be to protect America and to protect the American \npeople. I would like to ask you, what, if anything, in this \nlegislation protects an American citizen who is accused of one \nof these crimes? Because the way I read the law, it is all \nabout alien enemy combatants.\n    We have had American citizens detained for a period of over \nthree years without charges. So I would like to ask you, what \nis the legal limit for holding an American citizen without \ncharges? Is it one year? Is it two years? Is it three years?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, two things. Number one, no American \ncitizen would be subject to these procedures. None of these \nmilitary commission procedures could be used with an American \ncitizen, and that is clearly provided for in the law."
"cooper","Mr. Cooper","cooper","Mr. Cooper","    So this law is doing nothing to protect the \nrights of an American who is being held without charges for a \nperiod of several years, as has been done by this government?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Any American--consistent with this statute, \nany American citizen who is tried for war crimes or any other \ncrimes would get the full protections of the Article 3 court in \ntraditional criminal proceedings.\n    An American citizen or an alien, it doesn't matter who, \nengaged in armed conflict against the United States and is \nproperly classified as an enemy combatant, may be held under \nthe laws of war as an enemy combatant. That is not to punish \nthat person, that is not for crimes committed; that is because \nof their involvement in hostilities against the United States. \nAnd the Supreme Court in the Hamdan case affirmed that general \nright of the government to hold enemy combatants, even \nincluding U.S. citizens.\n    But as you say, very, very few cases such as that."
"cooper","Mr. Cooper","cooper","Mr. Cooper","    How long should an American citizen be held \nwithout charges?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, any enemy combatant under the laws of \nwar can be held during the pendency of hostilities.\n    As you have seen recently----"
"cooper","Mr. Cooper","cooper","Mr. Cooper","    Without charges, even if they are American \ncitizens?\n    Mr. Bradbury. As you have seen recently with the case of \nMr. Padilla, he was being held as an enemy combatant and--had \nbeen designated as an enemy combatant by the President and was \nheld, and then was transferred over to the custody of the \nDepartment of Justice and charges were brought. And he is down \nin Florida."
"cooper","Mr. Cooper","cooper","Mr. Cooper","    So three years is okay, being held without \ncharges?\n    Mr. Bradbury. There isn't a hard and fast rule under laws \nof war. As you know, we have held some enemy combatants at \nGuantanamo Bay."
"cooper","Mr. Cooper","cooper","Mr. Cooper","    I am talking about American citizens. So three \nyears is okay?\n    Mr. Bradbury. It depends on the circumstances and we are \ntalking about----"
"cooper","Mr. Cooper","cooper","Mr. Cooper","    That is what the government has done.\n    Mr. Bradbury. What the government has done----"
"cooper","Mr. Cooper","cooper","Mr. Cooper","    Three years is okay?\n    Mr. Bradbury. The law of war says you can hold an enemy \ncombatant for the duration of the hostilities. That is a right \nthat every country has, and the Supreme Court affirmed the \nability of the United States to do that.\n    Again, there have been extremely few cases such as you \ndescribed."
"cooper","Mr. Cooper","cooper","Mr. Cooper","    Let me ask about the disclosure by the \nPresident of the extraordinary rendition program. If any other \ngovernment official had done that, that would have been a \nsecurity breach, right, without his permission?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, of course the President has the \nauthority under the Constitution to protect classified sources \nand methods and to make decisions about what should be \nclassified and what shouldn't. And also the Director of \nNational Intelligence can declassify information.\n    So the President has the ability to make decisions about \ndisclosures of information when it is in the national interest \nof the United States that others who are not classifying \nauthorities may not have."
"cooper","Mr. Cooper","cooper","Mr. Cooper","    And his decision had nothing to do with the \nproximity of the upcoming election?\n    Mr. Bradbury. I think he explained the timing of his \ndecision in his remarks yesterday."
"cooper","Mr. Cooper","cooper","Mr. Cooper","    Let me ask you about the President's signing a \nstatement. When he signed the McCain anti-torture language into \nlaw, didn't the President reserve to himself the authority to \ninterpret that language as he alone saw fit under his powers as \ncommander in chief and as a unitary executive?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, it is--one of the things I do is \nprovide legal advice to the executive branch, and it is \ninherent in executive authority if you are going to carry out a \nlaw and execute a law, you will have to interpret what it \nmeans."
"cooper","Mr. Cooper","cooper","Mr. Cooper","    If it is inherent, why did he have to state it?\n    Mr. Bradbury. He didn't really have to state it."
"cooper","Mr. Cooper","cooper","Mr. Cooper","    So it was unnecessary verbiage?\n    Mr. Bradbury. I think that I am not going to say it is \nunnecessary, but it is not necessary for the President to \nprovide a signing statement to legislation. We actually think \nit is helpful to Congress. It is part of the dynamic of a \ndialogue between the branches.\n    It is also helpful to--in many cases, to the executive \nbranch when the President specifies how a particular piece of \nlegislation is going to be interpreted or whether it raises \ncertain issues that the executive branch needs to know about \nwhen it is carrying out the law."
"cooper","Mr. Cooper","cooper","Mr. Cooper","    Final question with the indulgence of the \nchair. The term co-belligerent in your legislation, I haven't \nseen before. It doesn't seem like a very flattering term for \nour allies or our Coalition partners.\n    Why did you use a term like that, because normally the term \nbelligerent is not a compliment.\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, it is actually a term of art that the \ngentleman to my left can probably explain better than I, but it \nis a term of art in the law of war and it really means another \nnation that is fighting in that war on your side. And, you \nknow, we may have allies; they may not in all cases and with \nrespect to a particular conflict be engaged in the conflict on \nour side, but may still be our allies. They are not technically \nco-belligerent, so we wanted to use that----"
"cooper","Mr. Cooper","cooper","Mr. Cooper","    How about ``Coalition partner,'' something \nfriendlier sounding like that? You couldn't say that?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, we just used a term that is consistent \nwith the law of war, and it would be recognizable in that \nsense."
"cooper","Mr. Cooper","cooper","Mr. Cooper","    I thank the chair for his indulgence.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Simmons.\n    Mr. Simmons. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    And thank you, gentlemen, for your testimony. I had the \nopportunity a year or so ago to go down to Guantanamo Bay and \nbe briefed on the methods and procedures and processes for \nholding detainees and for conducting questioning or \ninterrogation. And what I was told at the time was that--and I \nshould say by way of background, I have had some experience \nduring my service in Vietnam with military methods of detention \nand questioning, as well as those of the Central Intelligence \nAgency, but what I was told at the time was, we are confronted \nwith a new kind of war, with a new kind of rules or a lack of \nrules, new types of combatants that don't wear uniforms, they \ndon't play by the rules. They--in fact, they flout the rules.\n    And so the detention and treatment of these folks does not \nfall primarily within what we might call the civil court system \nnor does it fall within the military system, and what we really \nneed is a new kind of law for a new kind of war. It seems to me \nthat what we are confronted with here today is just that, a new \nkind of law for a new kind of war.\n    Now, some years ago when I served as a staff director of \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee, we oversaw the application \nof the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court under the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which was, in fact, a \nnew kind of court for the situation that we faced back in that \nCold War environment.\n    A colleague of mine, a Coast Guard attorney has written \nextensively on this subject, Commander Glen Sulmasy and has \ncalled for a new kind of court, for a new kind of judgment, \nnamely a national security court, a hybrid between what we have \nhad in the past.\n    Are any of you familiar with this proposal? Would any of \nyou have any comments on it, or do any of you feel what is \nbeing proposed today does reflect that hybrid that reflects \nthis new kind of war, that requires a new kind of law to apply \njustice? And I would open it to any of the members.\n    General Black. Sir, I am not familiar with the proposal \nthat you have offered up, but I would suggest that your \ncomments about the proposed legislation being--kind of fitting \ninto that hybrid mode are very accurate. I think it does indeed \ndo that. And I share or concur generally in the way ahead with \nrespect to this legislative package.\n    Mr. Simmons. And have any of you had the opportunity to \ndiscuss this hybrid, or this new approach, with civilian \nattorneys, prosecutors, defense attorneys, civil and criminal \nlawyers, trial attorneys and others? And if so, what kind of \nfeedback are we getting? Or is this really the first shot out \nof the box for this issue?\n    Admiral MacDonald. Sir, this is really the first shot out \nof the box. The proposal is pretty new, and it has gone through \na number of iterations as we have worked with Justice, \nDepartment since probably the latter part of July, working on \nthis proposal pretty closely with Justice Department on these \nrules. So I think it was premature to have discussed that with \nany of our civilian counterparts.\n    It would be interesting, I think, now that this is out and \npublic to have that dialogue.\n    Mr. Simmons. And what would you consider to be the \nappropriate time frame?\n    Again, we have been in this situation, in this business, \nfor a period now of several years, 9/11 will have its fifth \nanniversary next week. So it has been about five years.\n    I think that there is a sense on both sides of the aisle \nthat we need to move forward expeditiously with this, that the \ncurrent situation requires it, that this so-called ``war on \nterror''--I would call it a war where terror is being used--is \nnot going to end tomorrow or the next day. We are going to be \nwith this problem for a long time.\n    How long do you anticipate it should take before we can put \ntogether a system of tribunals, commissions or national \nsecurity courts that address this problem?\n    General Dunlap. Sir, I would say that I do think it is \nimperative to move forward with a process to establish military \ncommissions, and I agree while there is much new, it does build \non the UCMJ. It builds on the manual for courts-martial, it \nbuilds on the history for military commissions.\n    That said, it is imperative, as well, that we do it the \nright way, and that is why, with the lead of this committee, I \ndid express some very serious concerns about the proposal, even \nthough I agree with the vast majority of it. But I do think \nthat the sooner we can get legislation, the sooner we can move \nforward with the commission trials, and that will facilitate \nour relations with our Coalition partners, with the \ninternational community and moving forward with the Global War \non Terror.\n    Admiral MacDonald. Sir, I would add one point to that.\n    We currently have the process in place. We have the \nmilitary prosecutors, the defense counsel in place. The \noverarching structure is there and waiting for a commissions \npackage to be approved. So I think once legislation is passed, \nit will be--we can generate commissions trials pretty quickly, \nbased on having those structures in place under the old \ncommissions package.\n    General Dunlap. If I could just add one point, it is very \nimportant, as one of my fellow panelists said, that the part of \nthe Detainee Treatment Act on habeas be clarified, because \nobviously the Supreme Court had difficulty or had concerns \nabout the application of that.\n    If we get bogged down with habeas petitions before we can \nget a commission case tried, then that could delay the actual \ntrials of military commissions, in my judgment. That is my \npersonal opinion, sir.\n    Mr. Simmons. Mr. Chairman, let me just conclude by saying \nthat I read recently a new book that is out on the arrest and \nthe prosecution of eight German saboteurs who landed in this \ncountry, on the East Coast of this country by submarine. Six of \nthe eight were electrocuted here in Washington, D.C., after the \ntribunal; none of them had carried out any aspect of their \nmission whatsoever.\n    But I would say that the so-called Administration of \njustice in that particular case was not a high point of the \nRoosevelt Administration even though we were at war and that, \nfrom my perspective, it is important that we come up with these \nnew tribunals expeditiously.\n    Again, nobody has been treated as those eight were treated \nso many years ago. But Americans do have a basic sense of \nfairness even in these difficult times, and I would encourage \nthat we move forward on this as quickly as possible.\nMr. Meehan."
"meehan","Mr. Meehan","cooper","Mr. Cooper","    Thank you.\n    Mr. Bradbury, so how many military commission convictions \nhave we had?\n    Mr. Bradbury. None, sir."
"meehan","Mr. Meehan","meehan","Mr. Meehan","    And we have had 261 convictions through the \nJustice Department for our own criminal system; isn't that \nright?\n    Mr. Bradbury. I don't know the exact number, but I know it \nis around there."
"meehan","Mr. Meehan","meehan","Mr. Meehan","    Two hundred sixty-one related to terrorism. It \njust seems to me after 5 years since 9/11 that we would have \nbeen in a better position, stronger position. Particularly in \nview of who the President announced yesterday that we have in \ndetention, that we would have anticipated how the Supreme Court \nmight rule and that we should have been, in Congress, a lot \nearlier than this. I don't understand why the Administration \ndidn't come to Congress to set up a military commission to deal \nwith this earlier. I think it is unacceptable that 5 years from \nthe anniversary of 9/11 and we haven't had a single military \ncommission conviction when our own Justice Department has 261 \nterrorism convictions.\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, I think the President also views it as \nunacceptable in the sense that it is past time to move forward \nwith these prosecutions. I think that what I have tried to \ncommunicate--last time I was here back in July following the \nHamdan decision, this is quite extraordinary in the history of \narmed conflict for the executive branch to come to Congress to \nget legislation for military commissions for the trial of enemy \ncombatants. This is an unprecedented----"
"meehan","Mr. Meehan","meehan","Mr. Meehan","    But we have had five years. You agree. And I \nagree with what General Dunlap says. We have to go through a \nprocess here. There are less than 20 days left before this \nCongress is scheduled to adjourn.\n    The President, as you say, he has a right to decide what is \nclassified and what isn't.\n    And he unilaterally decided he will present all of this \ninformation with less than 20 days left on the calendar. Now we \nare asked to come up with something, frankly, we should have \nhad a long time ago, and the proposal that I have seen \nessentially is a validation of what the Administration has been \ndoing all along. It has been rejected by the Supreme Court. \nThis policy is, seems to me, is not helping make America more \nsecure. The fact there are so many JAGs here today that can \npoint to serious flaws in the legislation proves that the \nrushed nature of this flawed proposal is problematic.\n    You have come before us basically asking us to rubber-stamp \nyet another increase of executive power, with a deadline that \nis ticking away, with a proposal that seems to create another \nloophole by which the Administration can bypass the Geneva \nConventions by approving abusive interrogation tactics after \nthe fact, and by allowing coerced testimony aren't you saying \nthat torture was okay in the past?\n    Mr. Bradbury. No. The legislation makes clear that any \nstatement determined to be obtained through torture wold be \ninadmissible in all circumstances. So we have an absolute bar \non admissibility of any statements determined to have been \nobtained through torture. As to other statements not determined \nto have been obtained through torture, every accused is going \nto assert that many statements were obtained through coercion. \nAnd we think, again, it should be left to the military judge to \ndetermine whether the statement under the circumstances, \nhearing the arguments on both sides, is reliable and probative. \nIf the military judge determines, based on all of the \ncircumstances he has heard under which that statement was \nobtained, that it is unreliable or lacking in probative value, \nthe legislation would provide that it would not be admissible.\n    So--and we think again those judgments should be made by \nthe military judges and we shouldn't create by statute some new \nexclusionary rule."
"meehan","Mr. Meehan","meehan","Mr. Meehan","    Wouldn't it be appropriate to craft a policy \nthat would be able to withstand a Supreme Court challenge and \nprosecute all of the detainees rather than to rush this \nproposal through Congress at the last minute?\n    Let me just read a quote. Senator Levin of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee was quoted in The New York Times today and \nhe said, quote: ``If the Administration had behaved this way \nbefore Gitmo and the drafting of the--the drifting of Gitmo to \nAbu Ghraib, we would be a lot more secure country, our troops \nwould have been more secure and our position in the world would \nhave been more favorable.''\n    Mr. Levin and others contested points in this proposal for \ntribunals in particular, denying the defense the right to see \nand therefore respond to classified information that is shown \nto the jury, and allowing the introduction of hearsay and \ncoerced evidence.\n    I would like everyone to comment on this. Would you comment \non the status of hearsay evidence in the President's proposal? \nI am interested in why the military rule of evidence 807 is \ninsufficient when it comes to hearsay.\n    Mr. Bradbury. I think I will let the JAGs really respond to \nthat because I think there was unanimity here on the hearsay \nproposal in the legislation that it is appropriate, and I think \nthey are probably----"
"meehan","Mr. Meehan","meehan","Mr. Meehan","    I am interested in why 807 is insufficient.\n    General Black. In the--go ahead.\n    Admiral MacDonald. Congressman, you are talking about \nresidual hearsay."
"meehan","Mr. Meehan","meehan","Mr. Meehan","    I don't see why the rule of evidence 807 would \nbe insufficient.\n    General Dunlap. We do have a recent Supreme Court case. I \nthink we have Crawford v. Washington, and we would have to \nevaluate what the impact of that case which does pretty \nsignificantly, I believe, limit the use of the residual hearsay \nrule. So in a military commission, setting the residual hearsay \nrule is in essence permissible. In other words, there is a lot \nmore latitude to get in hearsay under the military commission \nprocess.\n    My personal view is that while I do appreciate the \ndiscussion in the proposed legislation about the military judge \nexcluding it if the judge concludes it is unreliable or lacking \nin probative value, and there is an additional paragraph in \nthere that is taken from I think Military Rule of Evidence \n(MRE) 403 that says that the judge can exclude it if there is \ndanger of unfair prejudice. But I would suggest, respectfully, \nsome additional language along the lines that--to make it \nperfectly clear that the military judge can exclude evidence if \nits admission, for whatever reason, is not in the interest of \njustice or compromises a full and fair trial. There are those \nwho will argue that that is implicit in the notion of exclusion \nbased on the danger of unfair prejudice, but in my personal \njudgment it would be helpful if we made that clear that that \nwould be a basis for the military judge to exclude evidence.\n    General Black. I agree with his comments, sir, but I would \nadd the provisions that have been incorporated into the \nlegislation with respect to hearsay. They are consistent with \nthe standard that has been applied in the international \ntribunals out there. I am very comfortable with this procedure.\n    Admiral MacDonald. Yes, sir. I would concur with General \nBlack. The International Criminal Tribunal of Yugoslavia, \nICTY--this is to the hearsay rule that is in the commission \npackage right now. That is the rule that is used and that is \nsupported internationally by that particular court.\n    And, again, going back to the Hamdan decision where the \nSupreme Court applied Common Article 3 and particularly talked \nabout those judicial guarantees that are common to all \ncivilized people, that would satisfy that standard. The current \nformulation in the package for hearsay would satisfy that \nformulation under--about national law. On my personal opinion, \nI am very comfortable with the formulation that is in here. And \na lot of this language was--it was a partnership between DOJ \nand DOD in coming up with the current language that is in this \nproposal."
"meehan","Mr. Meehan","meehan","Mr. Meehan","    General, earlier you said you were surprised by \nthe Supreme Court decision. Were you surprised at the decision?\n    Admiral MacDonald. Yes, sir."
"meehan","Mr. Meehan","meehan","Mr. Meehan","    I think you testified to that earlier, you were \npersonally surprised.\n    Admiral MacDonald. I think everybody was surprised that the \nSupreme Court for the first time would apply Common Article 3 \nin this type of a conflict. That is water under the bridge now, \nand now we are left with the Hamdan decision and Common Article \n3 applies, so now what we have done in looking at the \ncommission's packages due to specific evidentiary rules that \nare listed in here--hearsay, coercion and others--do they \ncomply with that standard as announced by the Supreme Court \nwith respect to hearsay? I think we are in agreement that it \ndoes.\n    Mr. Wilson. In the absence of the Chairman, I am \nCongressman Joe Wilson from South Carolina. I am particularly \nhappy to be here today. I served 28 years in the JAG Corps and \nso as I look out and see you today, I want to thank you for \nyour service. Additionally, I truly have never been prouder of \nJAG. Traveling the world six times to Iraq, twice to \nAfghanistan, twice to Guantanamo Bay, I have been so impressed \nby the professionalism of the JAG officers that you are \ntraining and giving leadership to. They are making such a \ndifference on the civil action projects. It is amazing to see \nthe progress in developing a military justice system for Iraq, \nfor Afghanistan.\n    The selflessness and dedication of JAG officers, I have \nnever been more impressed. I am also very grateful. My oldest \nson served in Iraq for a year with the field artillery, and he \nhas returned home and he has just done a branch transfer to \nJAG. So I am very, very grateful that he will have what dad \ndidn't have, and that is combat arms experience. He is going to \nbe an excellent JAG officer.\n    The question that I have, Mr. Bradbury, under the \nAdministration's proposal, the standard for admitting evidence \nunder your proposal is whether the military judge finds the \nevidence would have probative value to a reasonable person. Why \ndid the Administration choose not to use the rules of evidence \napplicable in trials by general courts-martial?\n    Mr. Bradbury. We chose to look to the same rule of evidence \nthat is applied in the International Criminal Tribunal context. \nSo that is exactly the kind of evidentiary threshold that is \nused in those international criminal tribunals. And that is \nwhat we are really talking about here is a criminal tribunal \nfor war crimes under laws of war. So you need a more flexible \nand open standard generally for admissibility, subject again to \nthe review by the military judge.\n    Mr. Wilson. The next question is the Administration's \nproposal states that all of the offenses codified in the \nlegislation have traditionally been triable by military \ncommissions. Of the 27 crimes codified in the Administration's \nproposal, which are considered a violation of the laws of war \nfor those codified offenses not considered a violation of the \nlaws of war, can you identify previous military commissions \nthat have made these offenses triable?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, the laws of war are not codified in \nsome code somewhere. They are really based on the sort of \ncommon law, if you will, international customs and law of war. \nAnd it is a concept that evolves over time, and you have some \noffenses which are traditionally recognized for centuries or \ndecades as violations of laws of war, and many of those are \nincorporated into treaties under laws of war, like the Geneva \nConventions.\n    Many of the offenses that we have listed in the legislation \nare drawn from those treaties and reflect those traditionally \nrecognized offenses that have been codified into treaties. But \nother offenses we think can be recognized in the laws of war, \neven if not codified previously into treaty. You are talking \nabout the kind of modern warfare involving war with a terrorist \norganization. Offenses like hijacking, offenses like terrorism, \nmaterial support of terrorism. These are the kinds of tactics \nthat the enemy is using in this new kind of war. And we think \nit is appropriate that the laws of war would evolve and reflect \nthose kinds of offenses.\n    So we think you can call them all laws of--violations of \nlaws of war. Of course, certain offenses that are in here that \nwe have codified, like material support for terrorism, come \nfrom Title 18 of the U.S. Code that is an offense that has been \non the books and these folks have been subject to that offense \nsince 1992 for the United States. We think it is appropriate \nthat when they use those tactics in this war against the United \nStates, they could be subject to trial for those same offenses \nunder the military commission process.\n    Mr. Wilson. And if you could provide at a later date what \nhas been done we would appreciate it specified.\n    Mr. Bradbury. Happy to do so.\n    Mr. Wilson. A final question I have, I don't mean to be \npicking on General Walker, but I am very impressed with his \nacademic background, Clemson University, where I have a son \nattending and another son a graduate, and then he and I are \nboth graduates of the University of South Carolina. But, \nindeed, a very serious question as a parent with four sons in \nthe military: How likely would it be that our soldiers would be \ncharged for violations of Common Article 3 under 18 United \nStates Code (U.S.C), section 2441, the War Crimes Act? Parents \nhave a great concern.\n    Mr. Bradbury. Maybe I will start us off. Since 1997 the War \nCrimes Act has made a war crime any violation of Common Article \n3. Now the United States has never been engaged and we never \nthought we were engaged in a Common Article 3 conflict, and we \nhad in mind the sort of atrocities that were committed in \nRwanda, for example, a classic Common Article 3 non-\ninternational conflict. And that is what we had in mind when we \nincorporated that into the War Crimes Act. It is not a \nrequirement of the Geneva Conventions, by the way, that we make \nevery violation of Common Article 3 a war crime. But Common \nArticle 3 contains some vague language, as I have suggested. \nAnd so what the parameters of those violations might be are \nsubject to uncertainty and also subject to evolving definition, \nbecause they can be interpreted by international courts and \nforeign governments. We think it is important to give it \ncertainty and definition for our troops, for our intelligence \nofficers who are on the front lines, in terms of handling \ndetainees on the war on terror so that they have that certainty \nand that clarity.\n    So what we would do is substitute or replace this general \nreference to any and all violations of Common Article 3, \nwhatever that might be, including humiliating and degrading \ntreatment, an ill-defined phrase, substitute for that a set of \nvery clear serious offenses that are well defined by statute \nthat we can all recognize as the most serious violations of \nCommon Article 3 and say those are the ones that are \nappropriate for prosecution as war crimes. So that all of our \nown personnel who are fighting in this war will have definite \ncertainties as to what will and will not violate that war crime \nprovision as a violation of Common Article 3.\n    General Walker. Sir, I think it is important that we have \nthis common definition. We have a definition of exactly what \nthe offenses are, but in the end we must remember that as we \ntry to protect our Nation, if a son or daughter of ours commits \na crime, a war crime against the United States, they need that \ncommon definition, application of standards, and they too would \nneed to be punished.\n    General Dunlap. Could I add something to that?\n    Mr. Wilson. Certainly.\n    General Dunlap. As a practical matter in the military, many \ntimes we will--we will prosecute something which might be a war \ncrime under one of our traditional military offenses: murder, \nrape, and so forth. One of the things that this country does \nbetter than many other countries is bring to bear exactly what \nyou spoke about earlier, the fact that we have a robust Judge \nAdvocate Corps in all of the services, because the evaluation \nof the specific facts and circumstances of a combat situation \nis informed, I think very hopefully, by the experience of a \nmilitary lawyer. So that when the decisions are made whether or \nnot someone needs to be held accountable, the convening \nauthority and so forth has the benefit of that kind of advice, \nand that is why someone who has the combat arms badge becoming \na Judge Advocate is especially valuable in these kinds of \nconflicts which are very confusing in chaos on the battlefield. \nThank you, sir.\n    Admiral MacDonald. Sir, I--I would add, the parents can \nrest assured that the military has trained to Common Article 3 \nstandards for quite some time. So it is--I mean, that is \nanother area that we spend an awful lot of time and effort in \nmaking sure that our soldiers, our sailors, our Marines and our \nairmen are well trained before they go in to combatants, the \nstandards of treatment that are expected of them when they \nhandle detainees.\n    Mr. Wilson. Again, thank you all for your service. And at \nthis time, Mr. Snyder.\n    Dr. Snyder. I want to make a quick comment. We had a \nconversation with another member, who over the recess had met \nwith a young Marine who had returned from Iraq and very \neloquently talked about the importance of the rule of law; that \nhe had had multiple discussions with Iraqis who knew that \nAmericans sometimes made mistakes, but that we had a system \nthat made it much more likely that people would be brought to \njustice, our people would be brought to justice, and he talked \nabout how important the rule of law was.\n    Mr. Bradbury, I do want----\nminute? I am told it would be nice to have a five-minute break \nhere. So we will go ahead and do that and hurry back."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","meehan","Mr. Meehan","    Mr. Saxton. The time is yours. Dr. Snyder, the floor is \nyours.\n    Dr. Snyder. Mr. Bradbury, I wanted--I don't want to ask \nthis as a question. I want to pick on you a little bit. You \nquoted the President. I read your written statement this \nmorning. You said the time has come. That is a--I found a very \ndisconcerting statement to hear the President say it and to be \npicked up by the Administration for a variety of reasons. One \nof them is on this side of the aisle, this issue had been \nattempted to be addressed for the last year. Congressman \nSanchez filed a bill June 23rd, 2005 that dealt with this and \nit was ignored by the Administration. You have had multiple \npeople from within the Administration make comments saying you \nwere going to get into trouble with this. It was predicted the \nSupreme Court was going to have problems with the route the \nAdministration chose.\n    So now to have the President, 60 days before an election, \nvery dramatically, with a packed house at the White House, talk \nabout the time has come, it is very discouraging for us who \nthink that what we need to do as a Nation is to be tough, \nthoughtful, and bipartisan and united and come up with a system \nthat reflects our American values and not to use these kind of \nissues as a--as political pawns in an election year.\n    I wanted to get some specific issues and I think I will \nmake some comments and let the military people respond if they \nwould.\n    First of all, this is an ongoing issue. Mr. Buyer is here \nbecause he is a JAG, as you know, in the Army Reserves. We \ndon't have much time, and usually when we ask questions for the \nrecord or anything written, because of the process it will be \nmonths before we get them. But I would like to direct a \nquestion to our folks representing the JAGs today. I would like \nyou to provide written information to all members of the \ncommittee on recommendations that you would like to see--have \nseen included in this that were not incorporated into this \ndraft. It would be helpful, I think, as we are trying to sort \nthrough this.\n    One of the issues that--Chairman Hunter is not here, but \nyou all went back and forth several times with Mr. Bradbury, \nthe JAGs, about well, what if you actually get down to a \nscenario with a piece of information that is classified and the \nprosecution could not move ahead without that piece of \ninformation. Would you all address this? What if that were on--\nthe shoe was on the other foot and it was one of our folks that \nwas captured by somebody and was being tried? Would we want our \nfolks--would you all want to be tried if you were captured by \nsomebody with a piece of classified information that you could \nnot confront? I would like you to respond to that.\n    I would also like you to respond to the specific question \nMr. Bradbury addressed. I am not sure I heard each one of you \naddress it. Do you feel that the draft we have here--and I \nassume you all got it before we did last night--do you feel it \nadequately addresses our legal obligations under the Geneva \nConventions?\n    And then my last question is the preamble, the findings; we \nmembers of Congress, we love findings. We always put stuff in \nthere. A lot of times they are not factually accurate. We love \nfindings, but it seems to me it is somebody's op-ed piece that \ngot included on a piece of legislation that is going to be \nproblematic. Is it necessary that we have that set of findings? \nI would think that we may be able to put together broad support \nfor a bill like this if we left off the findings.\n    Those are my questions, if we can have the JAGs respond. \nStart with General Black.\n    General Black. With respect to your question on classified \nevidence, I think I articulated my position early on. I think \nwe need two protections built into the legislation, the first \nof which would provide that evidence should be excluded if it \nis the sole evidence that is necessary to prove a material fact \nfor conviction. And the second recommendation or the second \nchange I would make would be to add a provision--would be to \nrequire instruction from the judge to the effect that if the \naccused has at the end of the trial been excluded from seeing \nclassified evidence, that the panel members, the members of the \ncommission itself, the triers of fact, be advised that that \nevidence was excluded and be advised that they should accord \nappropriate weight to it. So I would make those two changes.\n    With respect to your second question, overall I am \nsatisfied that the legislative package as it exists right now \nsatisfies our obligations under international law.\n    And your third question I think is out of my lane, sir.\n    Admiral MacDonald. Sir, I would agree with General Black \nwith just, I guess, a couple of caveats. First, with respect to \nclassified evidence. I think you--your first question alluded \nto how would we feel if such a rule were applied against one of \nour own service members. And we have actually testified to that \nbefore in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee and we have \ntestified with the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs who \nmentioned--General Myers mentioned that the issue of \nreciprocity was an issue for him, and it is an issue, in my \npersonal opinion, for me as well that we would be the first \ncountry that would allow evidence to be presented against an \naccused that he would not be able to view. And I would be very \nconcerned as a matter of policy that such a rule could be \napplied against one of our service members by another country \nthat is out there.\n    Dr. Snyder. And their defense would be, hey, this is how \nyou treat our guys.\n    Admiral MacDonald. Yes, sir. So to your second question, I \nam generally pleased with the commission package I would say, \nwith two caveats, the first one being the classified evidence \nthat I just mentioned, and the second being that provision that \ntalks about coerced statements and that you could admit coerced \nstatements as long as they were reliable and probative. And you \ncould have a statement that was determined to be reliable by a \nmilitary judge based on other evidence that was introduced that \nwas nevertheless coerced. And I am concerned about that.\n    The legislation right now bans the use of statements \nobtained by torture. That is a good thing. I would recommend \nthat you look to the Detainee Treatment Act which you passed \nfor additional standards, and I would recommend that you look \nto--and I think I mentioned this earlier to the Chairman--that \nyou look to the cruel and inhumane and degrading treatment. If \nstatements were obtained in violation of the Detainee Treatment \nAct, I would recommend that those statements be excluded. And I \nthink that goes to not necessarily because you couldn't make \nout that they were reliable or probative, but because I think \nthat goes to the underlying fairness of our process and our \nproceedings. So with those two caveats, I am generally pleased \nwith the commission's package.\n    Dr. Snyder. Mr. Dunlap.\n    General Dunlap. I completely agree with Admiral MacDonald \nin all of the particulars. My main concerns about the \nlegislation as it is written are those that he has articulated \nin the exact same way. I feel that the proposal is deficient in \nthose respects that he has outlined as to whether or not we \nwould want to be tried, or any servicemen. I wouldn't want any \nAmerican citizen or any citizen of the world tried under a \ncircumstance where the finder of fact would have evidence that \nthe accused never sees. I don't think that that process would \nmeet Common Article 3 or fundamental notions of justice. We are \na better country than that.\n    So, and as to the third item, I do think it is out of my \nlane, and I respectfully defer on that one.\n    General Walker. Sir, in my opening statement I said I had \ntwo concerns. The first of those dealt with trying an \nindividual where he does not have the ability to see the \nevidence against him. I simply believe that there can be no \nfull and fair trial absent the accused's ability to see the \nevidence against him and to be present when that evidence is \npresented. I think that is one of those baseline principles \nthat are fundamental and considered indispensable to a system \nof justice among civilized people.\n    As to the issue of reciprocity, it is really tied with that \none, sir. I think we have to understand as Congress debates \nthese important issues that what we do, how we treat these \nindividuals, can have an impact upon how other countries treat \nour servicemen and women as they go to foreign shores in future \nconflicts in future years. So that reciprocity is important.\n    Generally, I believe we have addressed in this proposed \nlegislation--it does address and comply with the Geneva \nConventions in my opinion, with the exception of the right to \nsee the evidence against you, even if it is classified. As to \nwhether the findings of the preamble to the bill are necessary, \nI concur that fortunately that is my decision to decide those.\n    Dr. Snyder. Thank you. One final comment, Mr. Chairman. I \nhave had some concerns and maybe this can get cleaned up. I \nhave read through this thing quickly a couple of times and it \nseems like it is still pretty rough. I mean at one point in \nthere, we refer to appellate counsel, appellate government \ncounsel, and appellate military counsel. I assume they are all \nthe same, but maybe they are not. There is a phrase, section \nhere, that says that there may be no disclosure to the defense, \nthe defendant, if the defense receives exculpatory evidence. \nNow, I don't know why--why would we have a provision in there. \nDoes that make sense?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Congressman, I believe that relates to only \nclassified.\n    Dr. Snyder. No, it doesn't. That is what I mean by the \nshoddiness of the way it is drafted. It says notwithstanding \nany provision of law, any defense counsel who receives evidence \nunder this subsection shall not be obligated to and may not \ndisclose that evidence to the accused. And the title of the \nsection is Disclosure of Exculpatory Evidence. That is what I \nmean by--while I encourage you to look at that, it can be \ncleaned up, but it doesn't say that it reads very clearly that \nit refers to all exculpatory evidence.\n    Mr. Bradbury. I think the subsection refers to classified \nevidence. That was certainly the intent, that it is limited to \nthat classified evidence that is determined under those very, \nvery extraordinary and limited circumstances by the military \njudge not to be appropriate for sharing with the accused. And \nthe reason we put that provision in that, specified by Federal \nstatute, that the defense counsel could not share that with \nthe--with the accused is actually in response to comments from \nthe JAGs and other military lawyers that we wanted to have \nsomething very clear in that event that would override the \nState bar requirements of those counsel. Because if you did--if \nyou left it silent, State bar rules might be interpreted to \nrequire that counsel not to participate in those proceedings.\n    And so we think you can override that by Federal law and \nthat would actually give a protection to the counsel \nparticipating in those proceedings and enable it to go forward.\n    Mr. Saxton. Dr. Snyder, I want to thank you for bringing \nthose last issues to our attention in particular and we will \nmake sure that our legal people will go through them.\n    Dr. Snyder. I encourage you to read that section.\n    Mr. Bradbury. We absolutely will, Congressman. Thank you.\n    Mr. Saxton. Ms. Sanchez."
"sanchez","Ms. Sanchez","meehan","Mr. Meehan","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, \ngentlemen, for being with us today. You know I have been very \nconcerned about this issue for several years now. I actually \nintroduced a bill in 2004 that dealt with this issue in \nparticular, since I had been to Gitmo and with the Padilla case \nand the whole issue of rights of these people that we were \nsupposedly trying, and of course with some of the lower appeals \ncourt decisions that came forward out of the D.C. court and \nalso the Supreme Court decision. So it was no surprise to me \nthat Hamdan came along and the Supreme Court basically said \nCongress hasn't been doing its job. And that is really where it \nis. I mean, the Administration walked on this and went and did \ntheir stuff simply because this committee in particular of \njurisdiction didn't address this issue.\n    Article I, section 8, is pretty clear. It is our job to do \nit and our counterpart in the Senate. So I am glad we are at \nthis point now, but we really could have done this several \nyears ago in my opinion.\n    I have been looking at the President's proposal and one of \nthe main issues that I have is this whole issue of an appeals \nprocess, because I think that is an incredibly important piece \nof this.\n    The existing military appeals court under the UCMJ commands \nwide respect, whereas the ad hoc review that the Administration \nhas provided for in the DOD military commission orders has \nfailed to command this kind of respect out of the commentators \nwho have been looking at this.\n    Mr. Bradbury, if the military appeals process that we have \nunder UCMJ is so revered, can you explain why the \nAdministration proposes to put in the Court of Military \nCommission review? In other words, why set up a new system when \nyou have got this system that works, that everybody likes, that \neverybody has respect for, where we have the experience. Why \nnot use that existing process?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, we have tried to create a parallel \nprocess. So we have used the model of the UCMJ Code of Criminal \nAppeals. But one of the things I think that has been very \nimportant, as I tried to stress to the President, in all of \nthis is that this be a separate and distinct process for \nmilitary commission trials, separate and distinct from the \ncourts-martial trials that are used for our own troops. So we \njust--we are simply creating a separate process that is modeled \non the UCMJ."
"sanchez","Ms. Sanchez","sanchez","Ms. Sanchez","    But doesn't it go out of the military and go \nto the U.S. Court of Appeals, to the District of Columbia \nCircuit and the Supreme Court? So it is into the Federal court \nsystem. It is not using the existing military system which is, \nyou know, which is what my point is, and appeals process that \nis tried and true under a commission that is sitting--that is \nbasically sitting under UCMJ.\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, I think you are referring to the Court \nof Appeals for the Armed Forces which hears appeals from the \nCourt of Criminal Appeals, which in turn hears the appeal of \nthe court-martial proceeding. And we simply chose to retain the \nappeal process that Congress had decided on and the Detainee \nTreatment Act and decided not to open that door again for \nredebate and reconsideration. We think it is a--in fact, in \nsome respects gives more protection in the sense that it is an \nappeal to an Article 3 court as opposed to an appeal to a court \nthat is not an Article 3 court: the Court of Appeals for the \nArmed Forces.\n    The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces is steeped in the \nprecedence and decisions of the courts-martial, and we felt it \nwas important that--and in fact a law would stipulate that the \nprecedents that have developed for courts-martial are not \nbinding in this procedure on military commission. Of course, \nthe courts can look to them as a persuasive precedent or useful \nprecedent but they are not binding. This, again, is a separate \nproceeding with separate standards, and we thought it was \nappropriate to have an Article 3 court that is--that is \nseparate from those precedents and those traditions taking a \nfresh look at the issues as they come up on appeal for the \nfirst time, because we haven't conducted military commissions \nin this country for a long time.\n    And so this will be a novel set of circumstances, and we \njust sort of wanted the whole process to be fresh and to \ndevelop as cases evolve under this new proceeding fresh, and to \nmake it clear that it is distinct and separate from the court-\nmartial traditions and the court-martial process."
"sanchez","Ms. Sanchez","sanchez","Ms. Sanchez","    May I have one more question?\n    General Black, in your testimony before the Senate Armed \nService Committee in July, you seemed to endorse the idea of \nusing existing military appeals court to review military \ncommission cases. Do you agree with that approach or do you \nstill have--do you agree with the approach that the \nAdministration is putting forward, or do you still have \nlingering concern with the appeals process? And don't you think \nit would enhance the credibility of the military commissions \nprocess to place them under the appellate jurisdictions of an \nestablished and respected military appeals courts? And of \ncourse I would invite any comments from the rest of the JAGs \nhere.\n    General Black. Let me begin, ma'am, but I am comfortable \nwith the appellate process that exists in the legislative \npackage that is put forth for three reasons, the first of which \nis since my testimony before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee (SASC) in early July the procedures have been drafted \nand we have incorporated a number of remarkable safeguards, the \nfirst of which is the proceedings will be presided over by a \nuniformed, certified, and qualified military judge. And I am \nconfident that the presence of such trained and certified \nindividuals in the presiding role will ensure a full and fair \ntrial at the trial level.\n    Second reason, though, is in getting right to the heart of \nyour question with respect to the--to whether the appellate \nmilitary courts would be an appropriate forum here, I think \nnot. I think that the interim courts that have been suggested \nhere with the follow-on appellate process that provides for \nreview by the D.C. Court of Appeals is a good way to go. And I \nsay that because our military appellate courts are, as Mr. \nBradbury suggested, steeped in the rules and procedures for the \nUniform Code of Military Justice. They are indeed experts in \nthat and the foremost experts in this.\n    This is a different process right from the beginning. And \nfrankly, you know, their expertise is, while perhaps related, \nisn't as related as might be hopeful or in terms of an \nappellate process. So I don't see that they are necessary. I \nthink the interim appellate court with a follow-up from the \nD.C. courts is an acceptable alternative.\n    And the third reason I think that is appropriate is the \nresponsiveness. Our military appellate court system right now \nis chock full of cases. They are working very hard and staying \nup with our workload, but adding this additional burden would \nnot be--would not be helpful at this time."
"sanchez","Ms. Sanchez","sanchez","Ms. Sanchez","    So you feel comfortable having it be 47A of \nthe Uniform Code system, but at the same time having the \nuniformed judge in a Federal court system doing this?\n    General Black. Yes, ma'am, I am.\n    Mr. Saxton. The gentlelady's time has expired.\n    Ms. Tauscher."
"tauscher","Ms. Tauscher","sanchez","Ms. Sanchez","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, General \nand Admirals. I have to tell you that as much as I listen to \nthis, both sitting here and in my office--I am not a lawyer, \nbut I have watched Law and Order for as long as it has been on \nTV so I consider myself to have a law degree by TV. I think \nmany Americans do. And I think that what many of us consider to \nbe one of the keystones of being in our system and being, \nfrankly, the envy of the world when it comes to our ability to \ndeal with justice in this country are three simple things: \nfairness, swiftness, and certainty. And up until now, as we \napproach the fifth anniversary of September 11th, we have been \nnone of those. We certainly haven't been swift, we haven't been \ncertain, and the fairness issue I think is something we are \ntrying to work on now.\n    What troubles me is the environment that this is all coming \ndown on, and none of you play in the dangerous game that we \nplay on this side. You play on a dangerous game in the \nmilitary. We play on one called politics. This is now being \nfoisted on us and, Mr. Bradbury, I am--I am impressed by what \nyou said. You worked with people--I think you actually said \nsomething like both sides of the aisle--but I can promise you, \nyou didn't work with any House Democrats on this.\n    And as as we sit here, we are now finding out what the \nAdministration's plan is, and I guess we are being told that \nthis has got to be done swiftly, and there has been no justice \nfor the 9/11 families in the four-plus years since September \n11th, but we have got to do this right now. And believe me, I \nstand second to no one in wanting to get these bad guys. I \nstand second to no one in wanting to be sure that we can \nexcrete from them in all possible manners, in things other than \nwe all know is wrong, the information we need to protect \nourselves, the person, people, and our allies.\n    But it is deeply troubling to me that in a very political \nenvironment this thing gets dropped on our heads and we are \ntold we have got to take it or leave it. And believe me, that \nis what is going to happen. This is not going to be the kind of \nprocess that we should have a deliberative process. Yesterday \nat eight o'clock I was at a briefing with some of your \ncolleagues on the new amendments to the Army Field Manual. Took \n18 months. We expected to have it last February. We weren't \neven told on February 28th that it wasn't coming. But there are \nlots of real good excuses why we didn't get it until yesterday. \nBut it took 18 months. But we are meant to do this in five \nlegislative days.\n    So I don't really have a question. What I really have is a \nsense of frustration. We have already gotten it wrong once \ndoing it just this way. And I will tell you that I have got \nlots of problems with the President's proposal. That doesn't \nmean I am weak. It doesn't mean that I am an appeaser. It just \nmeans I am trying to do it right. I would like to be able to \nreally believe that if we found Osama bin Laden we could \nactually prosecute him and get justice for the American people. \nI am not sure we can under the circumstances that we have now.\n    I applaud all of you for your hard work. I know that you \nare trying to do the best you can. We are, too, on this side. I \nam not sure we are winning. I yield back.\n    Mr. Saxton. I thank the gentlelady.\n    Mr. Bradbury, did you meet with Mr. Skelton? Did you have a \nmeeting with them on this subject?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Yes, sir.\n    Mr. Saxton. Thank you. Susan Davis.\n    Ms. Davis of California. Thank you."
"tauscher","Ms. Tauscher","tauscher","Ms. Tauscher","    Mr. Chairman, can I make a point? We never \nsaw the proposal until last night, even though he might have \nmet with Mr. Skelton.\n    Mr. Bradbury. I did show draft legislation to Mr. Skelton.\n    Mr. Saxton. It is Mrs. Davis' time.\n    Ms. Davis of California. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Can I \nfollow up on that for a second, because I know you all have had \ninput, and perhaps you would be willing to share that process \nwith us and how much input you actually had. But we could go \ndown the line. When did you all see the final language of this? \nCould you share that with us? Mr. Bradbury, I assume you saw \nit. When was it complete, I guess?\n    Admiral MacDonald. We were given it last Friday. Actually, \nI am sorry, a week ago Wednesday we received what was the final \ndraft to take a look at. The proposal that you received, we did \nnot receive until day before last.\n    Now I think also, Congresswoman, you asked about our \ninvolvement in the process. I would say that we had a very \nrobust discussion with Department of Justice beginning in late \nJuly, which included setting up a working group between DOD and \nDOJ that met over about three or four days, working on going \nback and forth with different proposals and adding language.\n    So what you see reflected here in this package, there was a \nlot of language that DOJ took from the military departments in \nputting this together. They didn't take all of our suggestions, \nbut that is the interagency process at work. They are not \nrequired to take all of our suggestions.\n    Ms. Davis of California. Right. I understand. Is there any \ndifference among the rest of you in terms of when you saw the \nmaterial, basically?\n    General Dunlap. No, ma'am. I saw the material exactly as \nAdmiral MacDonald has testified. I would, just to make it \nclear, there were some meetings at the end of July and in the \nbeginning of August. But to my knowledge, there have not been \ndiscussions since the beginning of August to a few days ago. I \nwill say that many of our suggestions were incorporated. Not \nall of them. And as you have heard before, I have at least one \nvery serious reservation about the proposal.\n    Ms. Davis of California. Thank you. I appreciate that.\n    Just in the interest of time I am just going to go on, \nbecause I think the two areas that you have all identified \ndealing with classified information and also with coerced \ntestimony, what do you see, what implications do you feel exist \nif in fact those concerns which you have addressed--and I \nunderstand that some of your concerns have been incorporated--\nbut what are the implications of that to you? It sounds to me \nlike those are very serious and you would want us to certainly \ntake that under advisement.\n    Admiral MacDonald. Yes, ma'am. I go back to the reciprocity \nissue that we raised earlier, that I would be very concerned \nabout other nations looking in on the United States and making \na determination that if it is good enough for the United States \nit is good enough for us, and perhaps doing a lot of damage and \nharm internationally, if one of our servicemen or women were \ntaken and held as a detainee. I think that the reciprocity \nissue really gets to the heart of it.\n    Colonel Reed. I think there is another part of the \nlegislation that goes to the reciprocity issue. And, again, \nunderstand that the legislation as proposed applies to unlawful \ncombatants, basically terrorists.\n    There is a section in the legislation that is critical, \nthat says for the folks who follow the law of war--the lawful \ncombatant, our men and women in our Armed Forces and the other \nmen and women in other armed forces of other countries--that \nthey will not be subject to this legislation, that they would \nin fact be tried under the UCMJ. That is a critical point, \nbecause if the argument is going to be made that we need to be \ntreated as we would treat others, we are going to treat lawful \ncombatants under the processes and procedures of the UCMJ.\n    General Dunlap. I slightly differ from my colleague there. \nI think the reciprocity issue is very important because, even \ntaking that argument at face value, there are other American \ncitizens in other government agencies, and whoever might be \nsubject to this kind of procedure--and I don't believe \npersonally that it meets Common Article 3 standards--to have a \ntrial where someone can be executed, where they don't get to \nsee the evidence that is presented against them before the \ntrier of fact. We can have procedures with the judges to \ndetermine what the summary is and so forth and what gets to go. \nBut once it goes to the trier of fact, in my personal judgment, \nit must be available to the accused so that he or she can rebut \nit.\n    Ms. Davis of California. Thank you. My time is up, Mr. \nChairman. I was going to follow up with a quick question about \nthe response of the Supreme Court to that; if you think that \nwould be an overriding concern as well which has been \nidentified in the Hamdan decision; is that correct?\n    General Dunlap. Yes, ma'am. I think it would be very \nproblematic.\n    Ms. Davis of California. Which could delay justice in many \ninstances.\n    Mr. Saxton. Thank you. Mr. Larsen."
"larsen","Mr. Larsen","tauscher","Ms. Tauscher","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It seems to me if we \nwould listen to the JAGs, not in July of 2006 but perhaps in \nJanuary of 2002, we would not be sitting here today. And you \ntalked about your involvement in the process in putting this \nlegislation together. Again, it seems to me that the reason we \nare here today is because of the lack of involvement or the \nlack of listening by this Administration from military judge \nadvocates back when they were first putting together this \nmilitary commission, and as a result we have had no trials, \ncommission trials, for terrorists. We have had no convictions, \nand we have had no justice for Americans. And we have been \nwaiting five years for this. And frankly the American people \nshould be very tired of waiting for this. And then the \nPresident says the time is now but.\n    Mr. Bradbury testified earlier that there is no guarantee \nthat these 14 guys they rolled out yesterday are going to be \nprosecuted under the system anyway. And so it seems to me that \nwe ought to try to get this thing right so that we do prosecute \nthese folks.\n    There is a level of justice for Americans. I don't really--\nI don't really care about the lives of these terrorists. I care \nabout some justice for the Americans who have been victims of \nthese terrorists. But then we hear that they may not be \nprosecuted anyway under the system that--under some bill that \nwe pass. We need to get something passed. We have been waiting \nlong enough, and I hope we don't get bogged down in some, you \nknow, bickering by the Administration over the reciprocity \nissue of classified evidence or coerced testimony.\n    It seems to me that there are definite concerns from \nuniformed judge advocates that if those issues are not \naddressed adequately, it may not pass muster again with the \nSupreme Court. Admiral MacDonald, would you say that is an \naccurate statement?\n    Admiral MacDonald. Sir, given the Hamdan decision and that \nwe had four justices who came down and said that excluding an \naccused from trial when evidence is presented against him, four \nof them said that they would have real difficulty with that. \nJustice Kennedy who would be the fifth, and who would give them \na majority, said that he would be concerned. He would view \nexcluding an accused detainee from the trial with concern. And \nafter the fact on appeal if it--if it prevented the accused \nfrom getting a full and fair trial, he indicated in his opinion \nthat he would--he would reverse. So I think the law is \nunsettled on this point, but you can draw your conclusions from \nwhere the justices came down on that point in the Hamdan \ndecision. And they tied it directly to Common Article 3."
"larsen","Mr. Larsen","larsen","Mr. Larsen","    Would you agree with that assessment?\n    General Dunlap. I agree it would be very problematic before \nthe Supreme Court. I don't think the Supreme Court, for \nexample, would ever affirm a decision to execute an individual \nwho was tried--the trier of fact relied upon evidence that the \naccused never saw and never had a chance to defend himself \nagainst."
"larsen","Mr. Larsen","larsen","Mr. Larsen","    General Walker, is this your opinion about the \nSupreme Court?\n    General Walker. I would really concur with that based on \nthe findings or the writings of the specific justices in the \nHamdan decision that it would be problematic where they would \napprove a procedure where the accused did not have access to \nthe evidence against him."
"larsen","Mr. Larsen","larsen","Mr. Larsen","    General Black.\n    General Black. I agree with General MacDonald's assessment."
"larsen","Mr. Larsen","larsen","Mr. Larsen","    Seems to me we ought to get that part resolved \nif that ever gets back. We wouldn't have a bunch of cases \nthrown out again because the Administration didn't do the right \nthing the second time, much less the first time.\n    I want to make a point about the findings as well.\n    You all--it is out of your lane, I appreciate that. You \ndon't have to make amends. I will make a comment. Finding \nnumber three, as an example: on page three it says the \nPresident's authority to convene the military commissions \narises from the Constitution's investing in the President the \nexecutive power and the power of the Commander of Chief of the \nArmed Forces. I hope we don't pass that finding. The Supreme \nCourt of the United States decision contradicts that finding \ndirectly. It says no, you have to come to Congress to get \napproval of this kind of commission. We have to put our stamp \non it, whether it is this proposal or something closer to the \nUMJC minus provisions. The Administration lost at the Supreme \nCourt. And as a result, the American people are left in limbo \non the prosecution and conviction of these terrorists.\n    So, just as an example of the findings that are just \ntotally out of whack with it and inconsistent with the Supreme \nCourt, we have to, you know--we need to take a full vetting of \nthe findings in this. Mainly just focus, probably, on what we \nneed to do, a process in place to get prosecutions and \nconvictions of these--of these terrorists.\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, Congressman, I will say, obviously, \nfindings in legislation are the business of Congress. We are \noffering these up as proposed findings. I don't think that one \nis out of whack. I would say this is an area where, very \nclearly under the Constitution, the branches share substantial \nresponsibility and power, because Congress does have the \nexpress authority under Article I, section 8, to define and \npunish violations of the law of nations."
"larsen","Mr. Larsen","larsen","Mr. Larsen","    But you have been using the authority to use \nmilitary force and you account for any and all justifications. \nWe pass something like this, who knows what you would use this \nfor in the future or this Administration or the next one or the \nnext one beyond that. We have to be very careful it isn't \nproven over the last five years. The Congress has to be very \ncareful how it crafts legislation, in providing legislation, in \nproviding authority to an administration, whoever it is, \nbecause of how they might use it in the future.\n    Mr. Saxton. Thank you, Mr. Larsen.\n    Mr. Bradbury and Colonel Reed, Mr. Larsen instigated a \ngreat conversation on the attitude of the Supreme Court. Would \nyou two gentlemen comment?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, I will say that it is the case that \nJustice Stevens and the four members of the plurality opinion \nlooked to just glance at the idea that classified evidence may \nbe used outside the--considered by a commission outside of the \npresence of the accused. I think Justice Kennedy reserved \njudgment on that point, did express some concern but said he \nwould wait to see how it is applied and how it unfolds in a \nparticular case and on appeal.\n    Again, we are suggesting that--like Justice Kennedy, we \nwould suggest that Congress not prejudge that issue and \nforeclose that possibility, because the circumstances of the \nparticular prosecution may necessitate it. And a military judge \nmay be able to do it under all of the protections and \nsafeguards we have put in, which have been--a lot of \nprotections and procedural requirements and hurdles have been \nadded to this legislation over the course of our very \nproductive discussions with the JAGS, not fully to the \nsatisfaction of the JAGs, obviously, but a lot of additional \nprocedural safeguards have been put in place. We think those go \na long way toward protecting the fairness of the trial in these \ncircumstances, and we would just ask that that door not be \nclosed on that possibility because it could be very important \nand serve for prosecutions.\n    Mr. Saxton. Thank you. Colonel.\n    Colonel Reed. I would agree with Mr. Bradbury. I have full \nfaith and confidence in our military judges that are certified \nunder article 26 to be able to look at these issues, to be able \nto use the parameters that are provided for in the legislation \nand come to a full and fair decision in terms of particular \nevidence.\n    I think that often if you paint a particular fact pattern \nwhere the sole evidence of an accused's guilt maybe a \nclassified piece of evidence they never see, you may very well \nend up in the result that Colonel Dunlap said. But I think the \njudge ought to be allowed the opportunity to make that call; \nand I am confident that the procedures here, at least from my \nperspective, offer a full and fair ability to get to that \nresult.\n    Mr. Saxton. Mr. Larsen's time has expired.\n    Mr. Butterfield."
"butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","larsen","Mr. Larsen","    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n    Let me join my colleagues in thanking each and every one of \nyou for your testimony here today. While I have not heard all \nof the questions and answers throughout the day, I did hear \nyour opening statements and thank you very much for your \ntestimony.\n    Let me talk with Mr. Bradbury for just a second. And I \nrealize that I am probably the last member to address you, and \nI may be standing between you and some food, and so I will try \nto be as brief as I can, but let me get back if I can, Mr. \nBradbury, to the reciprocity issue. Did you speak to \nreciprocity at any time during the day? I know some of the \ngenerals did, but would the Administration find these \nprocedures that you put forward to be acceptable to one of our \nmembers if they were being tried by a foreign government?\n    Mr. Bradbury. I think probably not, and I think that--I \nwould say, we think that the procedures are fair and that they \ncomply with Common Article 3. When you are talking about your \nown troops, you would like to see as many procedural safeguards \nas possible. Reciprocity is a legitimate concern and one that \nmerits a lot of attention and----"
"butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","    If Lieutenant John Smith was captured on \nthe battlefield by another government and put on trial, we \nwould not want these same rules to apply. Is that the \nAdministration's position?\n    Mr. Bradbury. We think these procedures are fair, but we \nwould like to see for him, under the Geneva Conventions, he is \nentitled to the same kind of procedures that that nation would \napply to its own armed forces. So just as we use courts-martial \nfor our own troops, we would like to see those troops tried by \ncourt-martial-like procedures with all those protections if \ncaptured by a foreign nation."
"butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","    I am sorry. Go ahead.\n    Mr. Bradbury. That aspiration and that international \nstandard does not mean that these procedures are unfair or \ninadequate."
"butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","    I have not had a chance to review this, \nand I am anxious to read the detail of your proposal, but do \nyou suspect that you will build a good support base of the body \nwith this bill? Do you think the Senate is going to support \nthis? Do you have any indications at this point?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, I think some senators have indicated \nsupport for it. I think that there is generally very broad \nsupport for--just as I think you have seen from this panel \ntoday--95 percent of what is in this legislation. I think the \none or two issues that everybody is going to focus on in both \nHouses of Congress are the issues that have been the focus of \nmuch of this hearing."
"butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","    Tell me if I am right or wrong on this, \nMr. Bradbury. Under the President's authority as he perceives \nit, a suspected terrorist can be held indefinitely, even though \nhe may be acquitted of a war crime. Is that the \nAdministration's position? If we put someone on trial, they are \nfound not guilty, are we obligated to release them to their \nhome country?\n    Mr. Bradbury. If the person has been determined to be an \nenemy combatant, lawfully detained in this--under the laws of \nwar, under those laws of war we can detain that enemy combatant \nfor the duration of the hostilities."
"butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","    Even though they are acquitted?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Even though they are acquitted for a \nprosecution of a particular war crime they may have been \nalleged to have engaged in. This procedure is a separate \nprocedure from that that allows the United States to hold enemy \ncombatants. This is a procedure for the trial and punishment of \nenemy combatants for war crimes that they may have committed. \nThat is separate from our right under the laws of war to hold \nthem as be an enemy combatant."
"butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","    I have in my hand, Mr. Bradbury, what \nappears to be 14 charges of conspiracy for the 14 individuals \nwho were being transferred to Guantanamo Bay; and it appears \nthat the charge is conspiracy. Wasn't conspiracy specifically \nexcluded by the Supreme Court in Hamdan?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Excuse me. No, Congressman. Justice Stevens \nand the four members of the Court in a plurality opinion \nconcluded that conspiracy was not a substantive offense that \ncould be separately charged under the laws of war, but that was \nnot part of the majority decision for the Court that Justice \nKennedy joined in. Justice Kennedy declined to reach that \nissue, and it is our view that conspiracy is something that has \nbeen recognized previously as an offense under the laws of war \nand something that Congress would be within its right to \nrecognize in this legislation."
"butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","    Finally, let me ask you, Mr. Bradbury, \naren't there currently courts-martial cases against our own \nmilitary personnel for crimes that have been committed in the \ntheater of operations?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Yes, I believe that is right; and the JAGs \ncan certainly speak to that."
"butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","    Tell me--and how are the witnesses being \ngathered in those cases? And how is the evidence being handled?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Congressman, I will defer on that question to \nthe experts who know better than I to my left.\n    General Black. Yes, sir. We are indeed trying cases both in \nIraq and in Afghanistan and back here at home. We have brought \ntroops and units back. We gather the evidence and the witnesses \njust as we do in any other criminal prosecution."
"butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","    Do you find it problematic?\n    General Black. It is difficult, sir, yes. At times when you \nare on a battlefield, it is difficult to find the witnesses on \noccasion."
"butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","    But we are doing it?\n    General Black. We are doing it. Yes, sir."
"butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","    Well, again, thank each one of you for \nyour testimony.\n    Mr. Bradbury. Thank you, Congressman. Appreciate it."
"butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","butterfield","Mr. Butterfield","    Yield back, Mr. Chairman.\n    Mr. Saxton. Thank you very much.\n    Mr. Buyer, thank you very much for your patience. It is, \nafter three and a half hours, your turn.\n    Mr. Buyer. Thank you, Mr. Saxton. It has been six years \nsince I sat beside you.\n    I want to thank you gentlemen for being here. I am going to \nask some questions about process, and then we will go to \nsubstance.\n    So, on process, I would--I am trying to get a better \npicture here on the participation of the JAGs in the process. \nSo, as I understand it, you were convened to be participating \nin a working group in July. Is that correct?\n    Admiral MacDonald. Yes, sir.\n    Mr. Buyer. And that lasted four or five days?\n    Admiral MacDonald. Yes, sir.\n    Mr. Buyer. And did you have any other contact since July?\n    Admiral MacDonald. No. But when we got the final package, \nwe reviewed it, and it hadn't changed substantively from the \nproposal that we received after the working group met.\n    Mr. Buyer. So as--speaking to the JAGs now, as you look at \nwhat is before us, the bill, and as you flip through the bill, \nyou could do what we do here in Congress. All of a sudden you \nrecognize your words, you recognize your provisions. When you \ngo through this, how much of this are your words and your \nprovisions? If I asked you to pull out a highlighter and \nhighlight what are your provisions in your words, could you do \nthat? Or would that be difficult to do?\n    Admiral MacDonald. I think we could do a decent job of \ndoing that. For example,----\n    Mr. Buyer. Let's just cut to the chase. Is this your work \nproduct? Or is this Department of Justice work product?\n    Admiral MacDonald. I think it is a combined work product.\n    Mr. Buyer. How much combined? Give me a percentage. You \ncan't do it? Or you are hesitant to do it?\n    Admiral MacDonald. No. No. I can talk generally about some \nof the provisions that I have seen, some of our changes.\n    Mr. Buyer. I will tell you what, if I partner with you in \nworking something, I think I know how much is my work product \nand how much is your work product, wouldn't you? You and I must \nhave a different consistency then, because I am going to know.\n    I guess here is what my problem is. I am going to go to Mr. \nLarsen. He complimented all of you. He complimented the JAGs. \nThe JAGs should be included more in the process. I concur. I \nagree. So I am a huge advocate of the JAGs here.\n    So I just want to know, you see, this is going to be called \nmilitary commission. You are about to be used. So if you are \nabout to be used, I want to know how much of the military has \nbeen involved in the process. So please answer my question. How \nmuch of this is military work product?\n    Your silence is killing me.\n    General Dunlap. Congressman, I believe that the draft was \nprepared by the Department of Justice.\n    Mr. Buyer. Okay.\n    General Dunlap. There was input by judge advocates and our \nrepresentatives, our folks, at the end of July. I believe the \nAttorney General came over and spoke with the Judge Advocate \nGenerals. I think that was on the 28th of July.\n    I am informed that the last e-mail exchange was around the \n9th of August, and Admiral MacDonald testified when we got the \nno kidding draft that you have, which was a few days ago, and \nthe draft that I looked at last night was the draft that I knew \nthat you were going to have, because I wanted to be 100 percent \ncertain that I was looking at exactly the same thing that you \nall had. I will say that, in my judgment, many of the concerns \nthat we had were included in the Justice Department draft.\n    I need to say that----\n    Mr. Buyer. In their opening draft? Or the draft subsequent \nto the working group?\n    General Dunlap. Subsequent to the working group, sir.\n    Admiral MacDonald. I would agree with that, the draft \nsubsequent to the working group.\n    Mr. Buyer. All right. What role did the General Counsel in \nDOD and with regard to the services play in this process?\n    Admiral MacDonald. The DOD General Counsel put together the \nDOD portion of the working group that went over to Justice \nDepartment over that three- or four-day period to work with Mr. \nBradbury's attorneys on that, the draft that eventually came \nout of the working group.\n    Mr. Buyer. Okay. Mr. Saxton, can I have some latitude, if I \nmay, please?\n    Colonel Reed----\n    Colonel Reed. Yes, sir.\nclassified evidence, you said, quote, in my opinion, classified \ninformation is okay. Is that your personal opinion or is that \nthe opinion of that reflecting the chairman?\n    Colonel Reed. The chairman and I have discussed it. He is \nas comfortable with the draft written as I am.\n    Mr. Buyer. So when you say ``my opinion,'' is it your \npersonal opinion or does it reflect the opinion of the \nchairman?\n    Colonel Reed. I can only----\n    Mr. Buyer. Are you here to reflect the opinion of the \nchairman?\n    Colonel Reed. No, sir. I am here as his legal counsel. \nObviously, I cannot speak for the chairman. Sir, you will have \nto ask the chairman that question. But in my discussions with \nhim, we have discussed this, we have discussed that particular \nprovision, and in those discussions I believe he is comfortable \nwith that provision.\n    Mr. Buyer. All right. With regard to the habeas corpus \npetitions that are pending presently, if we adopt this process, \nwhat impact does that have on the present pending cases?\n    Mr. Bradbury. It would extinguish the habeas cases and it \nwould limit the review as the Detainee Treatment Act provided \nfor to appeals from Combatant Status Review Tribunal \ndeterminations of enemy combatant status and final judgments of \nthe military commissions. Other than that, all the habeas cases \nwould be extinguished by this legislation.\n    Mr. Buyer. Major General Black, if we were to adopt your \nposition, the position also endorsed by some of the other JAGs, \nwith regard to the sole evidence to convict, defendant cannot \nconfront the evidence that it may violate a fundamental or \nindispensable judicial guarantee; therefore, the case should \nnot proceed. Then if we are not--if we have got an individual \nwe know is one of the conspirators of 9/11, but we have got \nsome particular sole evidence that the Administration believes \nshould--they don't want to show them that evidence, we then \nhold that individual for as long as we are involved in the war \non terror?\n    General Black. Yes, sir.\n    Mr. Buyer. All right. With regard to discovery and \nfollowing the rules of discovery, so the American taxpayers are \ngoing to be paying for all of this discovery by the defense, \nwould they not? The American taxpayers are going to be paying \nfor the defense costs of the September 11 terrorists.\n    General Black. Roger.\n    Mr. Buyer. They are, aren't they? All the JAGs are nodding \ntheir heads in the affirmative.\n    General Dunlap. It is possible that some civilians--of \nfunds to fund the defense, and there are many groups out there \nthat I believe will want to defend----\n    Mr. Buyer. I just want to make sure. You are absolutely \ncorrect. They can hire their civilian counsel. They can do \ntheir own defense. But if they cannot hire or if they do not \nhave the means, the American taxpayers are going to be paying \nfor that defense just like indigent counsel, right?\n    General Dunlap. Yes, sir.\n    Mr. Bradbury. I would say, Congressman, that the military \ndefense counsel are already going to be employees of the \nFederal Government whose salaries are paid. But, yes, you are \nright. We would be providing defense counsel, appointed \nmilitary defense counsel, to these individuals, but we would \nnot be paying for their private counsel.\n    Mr. Buyer. Well, I just want the world to know and \nunderstand, as we are putting together a process that gives \njudicial guarantees, that the American taxpayer is going to be \nproviding not only the counsel but also the discovery process \nhere.\n    With regard to the United Kingdom and Spain, do we know how \nthey are treating these individuals who are also al Qaeda and \ncommitted terror acts against their own people? Mr. Bradbury, \ndo we know what they are doing and how they treat them and the \nstatus by which we give what we call these unlawful combatants?\n    Mr. Bradbury. Well, we do know how they treat criminal \ndefendants who have been taken up under their new terrorism \nlaws, for example, in the U.K. But with respect to those who \nare not charged, that are just held perhaps by intelligence \nservices, I have no personal knowledge of that.\n    Mr. Buyer. All right. The reason I ask that question--and I \nappreciate the latitude of the Chair--is that status is \neverything here. So I agree with the JAGs, and I am not going \nto incorporate my feelings with some of the feelings of my \ncolleagues that are upset here over a delay of time or whether \nvictims of September 11 are finding their justice because I am \njust as shocked at the Supreme Court. I would be in the three \nin the Supreme Court, applying Common Article 3 of the War \nCrimes Act to this.\n    It blows my mind. I mean, I got it wrong at the JAG school. \nI just didn't get that. So now I look at this and go, what \nhappened? How are we going to treat saboteurs now? Or status is \ngoing to be everything now. If we are going to create this \nprocess, that is that access. So now that article 5 hearing is \npretty doggone important on where we go from here and who gets \naccess into this new court of jurisdiction. This is really \ninteresting.\n    Mr. Saxton. Mr. Buyer, unfortunately, some----\n    Mr. Buyer. I understand.\n    Mr. Saxton. The Subcommittee on Intelligence of the \nHomeland Security Committee is waiting for this room and have \nbeen since 1. So under other circumstances----\n    Mr. Buyer. Can I look through my notes real quick?\n    Mr. Saxton. Real quick.\n    Mr. Buyer. All right. Hold on. All right, I think I have \ngot enough for now. I am going to see you afterwards.\n    Mr. Saxton. We thank you for your participation and your \npatience; and if you would be kind enough to make yourself \navailable to this committee as we work through this process, we \nwould appreciate it.\n    Mr. Buyer. Thank you. Look forward to working with the \ngentlemen of the committee.\n    Mr. Saxton. Thank you.\n    I asked a short question earlier today regarding how this \nprocess would treat members of other terrorist organizations \nother than al Qaeda who have engaged in hostilities against the \nUnited States; and I wonder, Mr. Bradbury, if you would perhaps \nput something in writing to us that would help us clarify this \nin our minds.\n    It seems like there are so many--it seems to me as a \nnonlawyer that there are so many sets of circumstances that we \nwill eventually have to make determinations on, prior acts \nprior to the time that we were engaged in hostilities with al \nQaeda, with the bombings in Africa, with the bombing of the \nCole, with the Saudi Arabian activities carried out by al Qaeda \nor other groups, and of course the question of other groups \nsuch as Hezbollah. All of these are separate, different kinds \nof circumstances, and we need to understand----\n    Mr. Bradbury. Yeah.\nand the law that we are going to put together to deal with \nthese types of situations.\n    Mr. Bradbury. Yes.\n    Mr. Saxton. I am not looking to prolong the hearing today \nfurther, but if you could just put something in writing.\n    Mr. Bradbury. I would be happy to do that. The legislation \nis intended to be flexible for future circumstances, and it is \nintended to apply to at-war crimes committed by al Qaeda \nmembers prior to 9/11.\n    Mr. Saxton. Good. And how long do you think it would be \nbefore we might expect to receive something from you on that? \nBecause we need to proceed next week with----\n    Mr. Bradbury. We will try to get you something next week.\n    Mr. Saxton. Thank you.\n    Thank you all for your participation. We appreciate your \npatience and participation as well, and the committee is \nadjourned.\n    Mr. Bradbury. Thank you."
