"conrad","Senator Conrad","","","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    I also want to thank our colleagues on the House Budget \ncommittee. Certainly the chairman and the ranking member, \nCongressman Spratt, they could not have been more gracious. \nThey have opened their space to us. They have allowed us to use \ntheir equipment. And it has been enormously helpful, and we \nvery much appreciate their graciousness.\n    Mr. Chairman, I also want to welcome Director Bolten to the \ncommittee. This is a challenging time, certainly for you, for \nthe administration, and for the Congress, as we address what I \nbelieve are deficits that are far too large and growing \ngeometrically. Certainly as we look ahead past the 5-year \nwindow, I think we have to be most concerned about the \ndirection, the fiscal direction of the country.\n    When I look at past statements by the administration, I \nremember very well in 2001 they told us we could have massive \ntax cuts and there would be no deficits, even with an economic \ndownturn. And that proved to be wrong.\n    Then the next year, they told us that the deficits would be \nsmall and short term. That also proved to be wrong. The \ndeficits have been large and long term.\n    Then in 2003, they told us that the deficits were small by \nhistorical standards. That, too, proved to be wrong. These \ndeficits are record deficits.\n    And now this year, we are being told that they are going to \ncut the deficit in half over the next 5 years. And I think we \nhave to ask the question: Will that, too, be wrong?\n    Let me go to just a back-of-the-envelope analysis that \ntells me that will be wrong as well."

"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    The President says in the fifth year the deficit will be \n$237 billion, but he is not counting the $259 billion he is \ngoing to be taking of Social Security surplus funds, every dime \nof which has got to be paid back. He is not counting the $23 \nbillion from the Medicare Trust Fund. He is not counting the \n$55 billion it would take to deal with the alternative minimum \ntax problem, which he is paying for for 1 year but not beyond. \nAnd he has no costs for the residual war cost, the war on \nterror, Afghanistan, Iraq, which the Congressional Budget \nOffice says in that year will be another $30 billion. That is \nover $600 billion being added to the debt."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Just a reality check. I went to the President's budget \ndocument and looked at 2009, and what one sees is the President \nhimself says he is going to add $633 billion to the debt in \nthat year."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    So how is it that we have much larger accumulations of debt \nthan the deficit picture that the President asserts would \nprovide?\n    Well, first of all, he is taking all the Social Security \nTrust Fund surpluses over the next decade, $2.4 trillion, and \nnot accounting for it--not accounting for it at least with \nrespect to deficits."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    In addition, the tax cut the President is proposing \nexplodes outside the 5-year budget window. He is only looking \nat 5 years, when we all know much of the effect of his \nadditional tax cuts occur beyond the 5-year budget window. This \nis the cost of the tax cuts, including the associated interest \ncost."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    And the same is true of the alternative minimum tax that \nwas the old millionaire's tax that now is going to be a middle-\nclass tax because we have two or three million people affected \nby it today. It is going to be 40 million people by the end of \nthe budget period, 40 million people and it costs $658 billion \nto fix. The President has counted 1 year of that cost, but does \nnot have a dime beyond that time."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    The same is true of war costs. The Congressional Budget \nOffice says in the 10-year period, $280 billion of cost for the \nPresident's defense policies, war on terror, and yet the \nPresident has no money provided beyond September 30th of this \nyear. They tell us we do not know what the cost will be, but we \nknow the right answer is not zero."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    The thing that most concerns me is the long-term trajectory \nbecause what we see is that right now we are in the good times, \nin effect, even though the deficits are at record levels, \nbecause we have these substantial trust fund surpluses. But \nlook what happens when the trust funds--the green bar is Social \nSecurity, the blue is Medicare--when they go cash negative, at \nthat very time the cost of the tax cuts explodes."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    And I will just end with this chart that shows the \nPresident's own analysis of the long-term budget circumstance. \nThis shows that the current situation, record deficits, is the \ngood times; that when the baby boomers retire and the \nPresident's tax cuts go fully into effect, these deficits go \nright off the cliff. And so I think we have to alert the \nAmerican people that we are on a course that is simply not \nsustainable, that fundamentally threatens the economic security \nof the country, and the biggest way it does is upward pressure \non interest rates and the biggest way it does is people \ndeciding they don't want to hold dollar-denominated assets."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    And I would just conclude with an article that is in the \nWashington Post this morning saying, ``Asian central bank \nconsider alternatives to big dollar holdings.'' Already we have \nseen the dollar go down almost 30 percent against the euro in \nthe last 18 months. I think we have to get very, very serious \nabout the fiscal condition of the country."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Thank you.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Conrad, thank you very much.\n    I would just make a couple of comments, and then we will \nrecognize Director Bolten. A couple of comments.\n    One, we had a big challenge last year to pass last year's \nbudget. It was not easy. Last year we were facing still the \nend, I guess, of a very soft economy. The stock market was \nstill very, very weak. And we were fighting a war. Our budget \nwe passed last year funded both of those. We did pass a growth \npackage, and the growth package worked. The stock market is up \nsubstantially. We did fund the war.\n    If you look at the chart, it shows that actually the \neconomy started declining in the year 2000. Some people want to \nsay, well, it was the Bush recession. But if you actually \nnotice, it started declining substantially in the year 2000. \nThe Nasdaq declined by 50 percent in the year 2000. And we had \na very soft economy.\n    insert chart\n    So we needed to do some things that would change it. The \nstimulus package that we passed--and I might mention that the \nDemocrats had a stimulus package and we had a stimulus package, \nand ours was supported by a bipartisan majority. It became law, \nand it did work.\n    If you look at the next chart, the stock market has grown \nby over $4 trillion since last February. We did cut the tax on \ndividends in half. Maybe some people want to double the tax on \ndividends again, but we made the tax on dividends 15 percent. \nWe made the tax on cap gains at 15 percent, and I think both \ngreatly helped our economy, as evidenced by the significant \nappreciation we have seen in the stock market. I think the Dow \nJones is up 25 percent, Nasdaq up 50 percent. That is a big \nchange, and I think in large part because of the changes that \nwe made and that we proposed."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    If you look at the next chart, there was a significant \nappreciation in jobs. You keep hearing about the jobs. The \nhousehold survey shows that we are at an all-time high in \nemployment. There is a difference between the household survey \nand the wage survey, and I do not need to debate that. But it \nshows, at least if you look at this trend, the employment \nsituation has improved rather substantially."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    But I do not disagree with Senator Conrad. I think the \nchallenges are very great before us. We are spending a lot more \nthan we are taking in, and the deficits are way too high. And I \nwill tell my friend and colleague Senator Conrad, I will work \nwith him to get them down. I will work with anybody, Democrat \nor Republican, to reduce these deficits. I think they are way \ntoo high.\n    If you look at the next chart, it kind of shows just the \nhistory of where we are. The green on the chart shows the \nrevenues, and you can revenues have actually declined. That has \nnever happened before. We had 3 years in a row really where \nrevenues did not grow. Actually, they declined.\n    If you look at the history, Senator Byrd, revenues over \nhistory in the United States almost always had some growth. But \nwe actually have had a very significant reduction, not because \nof the tax cut, mostly because of the recession. The tax cut \nhad some play in it, but the recession was the biggest reason \nwhy you had such a significant drop from over $2 trillion to \nabout $1.78 trillion. I notice, Senator, from the figures \nestimated by both CBO and OMB, very little revenue growth \nbetween 2003 and 2004. I hope the 2004 revenues are \nunderestimated, and my guess is they are. I will just say that. \nWe will find out 10 months from now, but I think they \nunderestimated the amount of revenue that we are going to \nreceive in 2004. I am not sure about your 2005 number, but we \nwill talk about that.\n    But you notice in the red line, expenditures have gone up \nevery single year. So we had a reduction in revenues, mostly \nbecause of the recession, somewhat because of the tax cut, but \nwe had an increase in the red line that is outlays."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Most of the outlay growth, if you look at the next chart, \nyou will see is kind of divided up between all other spending, \ndomestic discretionary spending. DOD is the red line, defense. \nYou will notice the last couple years, if you add the war, the \nwar being the big delta, we had supplementals of $79 and $87 \nbillion in 2003 and 2004. That is that top delta that shows a \nbig increase of spending because we had to fight the war. The \nyellow lines are new spending. That is homeland security. So \nthat is where most of the new money went.\n    So I just make mention of those facts, and the fact that we \nhave a big challenge. We are spending more than we are taking \nin. We have to close that gap. And it will not be easy, and it \nprobably will not be done unless we all work together to make \nit happen.\n    We have to have a budget. The administration has proposed a \nbudget. We will work to pass a budget this year. It was not \neasy last year. It will not be easy this year. But I think it \nwould be irresponsible of Congress if we do not pass a budget.\n    And so I applaud the administration. They have given us a \nchallenge, and they said they think we should reduce the \ndeficit by half in 5 years. I believe strongly that we should \ndo that. I hope that we can accelerate that. I hope that we can \ncut the deficit in half--did I say balance the budget or cut it \nin half? The administration wants us to cut the deficit in half \nin 5 years. I hope we can meet or exceed that level. I hope we \ncan do it 2 or 3 years. I cannot stand the idea of having \ndeficits at the $400 and $500 billion level. It bothers me \ndaily. And I am very serious about that.\n    So I hope we can aggressively try and get our deficit, \nwhether you are talking about GDP or you are talking about \ndollar-wise, get it to a much smaller, more sustainable figure, \nat the $200 billion level in the next year or so. And I will \nwork aggressively to do that. And that may mean taking on some \npopular programs, like a highway bill that my colleague from \nOklahoma is in the process of passing, and others. I want that \nhighway bill to be paid for, and presently it is not paid for \nsatisfactorily, and certainly not entirely.\n    I want to thank my friend, Senator Conrad, because he was \nof great assistance in our markup in the Finance Committee on \nthat bill on Monday.\n    So we have many, many big challenges before us. We look \nforward to the administration presenting their budget to us. \nAnd just for the information of our colleagues, we were \nscheduled to have Secretary Snow testify yesterday and could \nnot because of the loss of the hearing room in Dirksen. We are \ntrying to reschedule him for as soon as possible. I was hoping \nthat we would be able to get Secretary Snow Tuesday or \nWednesday. We have not confirmed that yet, but we will notify \nmembers as soon as we can have Secretary Snow scheduled.\n    We have Secretary Thompson scheduled for next Thursday, and \nthat will be in the Senate. And then we have a couple of others \nlined up, and we will notify all members as soon as possible on \nthat.\n    We do expect to work through the entire budget process in \nthe next 2 months, and so we have a lot of work to do, and we \nwill have hearings basically throughout this month, and then \nthe month of March we will begin committee markup, floor \nmarkup, and conference.\n    I told Senator Byrd I wanted to talk to him about it. I do \nwant to tell all members I would like to improve the process \nthat we consider the budget on the floor. I have been \nembarrassed with our vote marathons, vote-a-thons, whatever you \nwant to call them. It is not a good way to legislate, and I \nthink we all recognize that. Maybe we can see if we cannot \ntogether, collectively, bipartisanly, improve the procedure on \nthe floor, and, frankly, add more respect and dignity to the \nSenate in consideration of a budget of the magnitude somewhere \nin the range of $2.4 trillion. We need to do a better job in \nmanaging the floor in that effort. So I am going to work with \nour colleagues and see if we cannot come up with some other \nimprovements, and I appreciate very much Senator Conrad's \nwillingness to consider some changes that might be an \nimprovement, not just this year but, frankly, in future years.\n    And, with that, Director Bolten, we will recognize you for \nyour comments. Welcome to the Budget Committee."

"","","conrad","Senator Conrad"," STATEMENT OF JOSHUA B."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Mr. Bolten. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Senator \nConrad and other distinguished members of the committee. It is \na privilege to have the opportunity to appear before you this \nmorning.\n    The 2005 budget that was transmitted earlier this week \ncontinues to support the President's three overriding national \npriorities: winning the war on terror, protecting the homeland, \nand strengthening the economy. The President is committed to \nspending what is necessary to provide for our security and \nrestraining spending elsewhere.\n    Since September 11, 2001, as you have emphasized, Mr. \nChairman, more than three-quarters of the increase in the \nFederal Government's discretionary spending has been directly \nrelated to our response to the attacks, enhanced homeland \nsecurity, and the war on terror. The President's 2005 budget \ncontinues this spending trend. That means significant increases \nin essential funding for our security programs, combined with a \ndramatic reduction in the growth of discretionary spending \nunrelated to security. With your support in enacting this \nbudget into law, we will be well on the path to cutting the \ndeficit in half over the next 5 years.\n    If I could have the first chart up, please.\n    Mr. Chairman, at OMB we have found it useful to try to \ndivide the discretionary budget into three categories, similar \nto the chart that you just showed. On the left is defense, \nwhich is basically the Defense Department. In the center is \nhomeland security, which is not congruent with the Department \nof Homeland Security; about two-thirds of that Department \nspending we characterize as homeland security spending. But \nthere are a number of other elements from other departments \nthat are included within that category, particularly from \nHealth and Human Services, the Department of Justice, some from \nthe Department of Agriculture, and others. And then on the \nright is everything else, which we label non-defense, non-\nhomeland spending.\n    The President's--yes?\n    Chairman Nickles. Excuse me. Does that include all the \nsupplementals? That includes all spending?\n    Mr. Bolten. No, it does not. We have another chart that \nincludes supplementals, but this one is just base discretionary \nspending.\n    The yellow bars represent the President's proposals for \n2005. What that reflects is, on the left, an increase in \ndefense spending by 7 percent to support our men and women in \nuniform and transform our military; in the center, an increase \nin homeland security spending by nearly 10 percent to \nstrengthen our capability to prevent future attacks; and on the \nfar right, holding the rest of discretionary spending to half-\nof-1-percent growth, well below the rate of inflation, while \ncontinuing to increase funding for key priorities such as the \nPresident's No Child Left Behind education reforms.\n    The President's budget is built on the sensible premise \nthat Government spending should grow no faster than the average \nincrease in average American family incomes, which is \napproximately 4 percent. This budget, the 2005 budget, proposes \nto hold the growth in total discretionary spending to 3.9 \npercent overall and, again, to reduce the growth in non-\ndefense, non-homeland security spending to half of 1 percent, \nbelow the rate of inflation.\n    Mr. Chairman, in the last budget year of the previous \nadministration, 2001--that is reflected in the green bars on \nthis chart--discretionary spending unrelated to defense or \nhomeland security soared by 15 percent. With the adoption of \nthe President's first budget in 2002, that growth rate was \nreduced to 6 percent, then 5 percent the following year, then 4 \npercent for the current fiscal year that we are now in, fiscal \nyear 2004; and as I have just emphasized, down below 1 percent \nin the President's proposal for 2005.\n    The President's budget builds on the pro-growth economic \npolicies that have laid the foundation for the economic \nrecovery now under way and for sustained growth and job \ncreation in the years ahead.\n    The tax cuts that you and the Congress enacted have been \ncritical to strengthening the economy and to creating jobs. \nPerhaps the best timed in American history, these tax cuts \ndeserve much credit for today's brightening economic picture, \nwhich includes nine consecutive quarters of positive growth, \nthe highest quarterly growth in 20 years in the third quarter \nof last year at 8.2 percent, ongoing extraordinary productivity \ngrowth, continued strength in housing starts and retail sales, \nand encouraging signs of renewed business investment. These \nindicators suggest that job growth, which typically lags \nrecovery, should continue to strengthen in the months ahead.\n    Mr. Chairman, the President will not be satisfied, however, \nuntil every American who wants a job can find a job. So this \nbudget supports the President's six-point plan for economic and \njobs growth, including making permanent the tax relief that has \nfueled our economic recovery.\n    The sustained growth that this budget supports will be good \nnews for our budget picture as well. As the economy improves, \nTreasury revenues will as well.\n    Like America itself, the Federal budget has faced \nextraordinary challenges in recent years: a stock market \ncollapse that began in early 2000; a recession that was fully \nunder way in early 2001; revelation of corporate scandals, \nyears in the making; and, of course, the September 11th attacks \nand the ensuing war on terror.\n    With Treasury receipts only beginning to reflect a \nrecovering economy and major ongoing expenditures in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and elsewhere in the war on terror, we still face \na projected $521 billion deficit for the 2004 fiscal year. That \nsize deficit at 4.5 percent of GDP is not historically out of \nrange. Deficits have been this large or larger in 6 of the last \n25 years, including a peak of 6 percent in 1983.\n    Under the circumstances that created it, today's deficit is \ncertainly understandable, but that deficit is also undesirable \nand unwelcome. And with enactment of this budget, we will bring \nit down.\n    With continuation of the President's economic growth \npolicies and sound spending restraint reflected in the budget I \nhave just outlined, our projections show the deficit will be \ncut by more than half over the next 5 years. This dramatic \nreduction begins in the fiscal year of this budget, 2005, for \nwhich we are projecting a deficit of $364 billion, roughly 3 \npercent of GDP. The rapid deficit reductions continue in \nsubsequent years, with our projections showing the deficit \nfalling to 1.6 percent of GDP by 2009. This is not only well \nbelow half its current 4.5-percent level; it is also well below \nthe 2.2-percent average deficit during the last 40 years. And \nyou will see on that chart a black line across the middle of \nthe chart. That reflects the 2.2-percent, 40-year historical \naverage deficit for the Federal Government. It is also roughly \na line that reflects cutting our current deficit in half.\n    This deficit reduction is the combined effect of economic \ngrowth and spending restraint. As the economy recovers, tax \nreceipts as a percent of GDP will rise to historic levels by \nthe end of the budget window, while spending restraint keeps \noutlays flat or slightly declining as a share of GDP.\n    The spending restraint reflected in this budget is not \nautomatic, so we are also proposing new statutory budget \nenforcement mechanisms, establishing in law limits on both \ndiscretionary and mandatory spending, and requiring that any \nincreases in spending be paid for by spending offsets.\n    We plan to transmit legislation to the Congress that has \nthree elements: one, reinstate the caps on discretionary \nspending for 5 years through 2009; two, a pay-as-you-go \nrequirement limited to new mandatory spending--any proposed \nincrease in mandatory spending would have to be offset by a \nreduction in mandatory spending, tax increases could not be \nused as an offset, and PAYGO would not apply to tax \nlegislation. Three, measure the long-term unfunded obligations \nof major entitlement programs and include a 60-vote hurdle in \nthe Senate for legislation that would expand these obligations.\n    I look forward to working with this committee to gain \nenactment of these proposals to restrain spending.\n    Finally, the President is keeping this administration \nfocused on what the American people care most about: results. \nThe measure of the Government's success is not how much we \nspend but, rather, how much we accomplish. This budget includes \na scorecard that measures the progress agencies are making in \nachieving results so that the Government continues to be \naccountable to the taxpayers.\n    Since President Bush took office, our Nation has confronted \na cascading set of challenges. The President and Congress \nresponded on all fronts, with tax relief to get the economy \ngoing, the largest reorganization of the Federal Government in \n50 years to create a new Department of Homeland Security, and \nthe largest increases in the defense budget since the Reagan \nadministration.\n    The President's 2005 budget builds on this record of \naccomplishment. With renewed economic growth and the Congress' \ncooperation in restraining spending, and focusing it on our \nmost critical priorities, we can accomplish the great goals the \nPresident has set for the country while dramatically improving \nour budget situation.\n    Mr. Chairman, I look forward to taking your questions."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Chairman Nickles. Director Bolten, thank you very much. I \nhave a lot of questions, but I also have a lot of colleagues, \nand I want to recognize them.\n    I am going to ask all of our colleagues that they try and \nkeep their questions and remarks in the order of 5, 6, 7 \nminutes. That would be appreciated, and I think by others.\n    I will withhold many of my questions until the second \nround. I think I will still be here. I doubt that others will \nbe. I will ask you one question, if you could help explain the \ndifference in scoring between CBO and OMB or CMS on the cost of \nthe prescription drug benefit. When we passed a budget last \nyear, we set up a budget that said we would spent up to $400 \nbillion over the next 10 years to strengthen, enhance, and \nimprove Medicare, including prescription drugs. The bill that \nwe passed was scored by CBO to be at $395 billion. Under your \nbudget submission, CMS, HHS, OMB, your actuaries have \ndetermined that it was in excess of $520 billion.\n    Could you give us a brief explanation of the differences \nbetween the scoring between CBO and CMS?\n    Mr. Bolten. Mr. Chairman, there is a substantial difference \nbetween the actuaries. CBO, at the time the bill was being \nconsidered and enacted, scored the cost at $395 billion. The \nestimate that the HHS actuaries put out, I believe at the end \nof December, was $534 billion. So a substantial difference \nthere.\n    The reasons for the difference are highly technical. I am \nnot sure I am the best person to explain it, but I know that \nSecretary Thompson has had an opportunity to address the issue \nin some detail, and I know that the actuaries are working \ntogether to try to resolve their differences.\n    The CBO and HHS actuaries have had differences for some \ntime about fundamental assumptions related to the Medicare \nbill. Those include how quickly the prescription drug costs \nwould likely come down because of volume buying. They include \ndifferent assumptions about level of participation rates. They \ninclude different assumptions about the level of participation \nby private plans in the program. All of this in an area that is \ninherently hard to estimate, but made especially difficult in \nthis case because of the novelty of so many of the programs \ninvolved.\n    The important part of this is that I think this is an \nhonest disagreement between experts, both of whom in my eyes \nhave a great deal of credibility. We in the administration are \nunder some constraint to carry the HHS estimate in our budgets, \nwhich we have done. So we are reflecting and carrying in our \nbudget the higher estimate. But I know the actuaries are \nworking together to try to figure out how to close their \ndifferences.\n    At the time you adopted the legislation, that you \nconsidered the legislation, what was relevant, as it always is \nwith legislation, was and is the CBO score. My expectation is \nthat as we submit our budget, CBO will in the ordinary course \nof things rescore our budget. And I expect that they will \nreflect their original score, because I understand that \nDirector Holtz-Eakin as recently as this week has reaffirmed \ntheir intention to stay with their $395 billion score.\n    Chairman Nickles. Thank you very much.\n    Senator Conrad."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Director Bolten, when did you know that \nthere was a difference, a substantial, dramatic difference, \nbetween the estimates of the cost of the prescription drug bill \nbetween CMS and your agency?\n    Mr. Bolten. I think all of those who were involved in the \nMedicare discussions were aware that there were differences \nbetween the assumptions of the CBO and the HHS actuaries. My \nunderstanding is that that was true all the way through the \nMedicare considerations."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    And did you ever feel that you had an \nobligation to tell Members of Congress that you thought the \nbill was going to cost much more?\n    Mr. Bolten. I wasn't directly engaged with the Members of \nCongress on the bill, but I know that Secretary Thompson, who \nwas, did discuss with members some differences in the \nassumptions. But within the administration, we were also aware \non this legislation, as in all legislation, that what counts as \nthe legislation is being considered is the CBO score."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Well, when you say you were not engaged \nwith members, you were engaged with me. You came up here and \ntold me that you thought additional steps needed to be taken to \nrein in spending, but you never once said to me that you had a \nbelief that the cost was going to be far in excess of what was \nbefore the Congress.\n    Mr. Bolten. Senator, yes, I did. I did engage with you and \nseveral other members on the long-term outlook here. And you \nwill recall that our conversation was about our interest in \ncreating a unified trust fund, which I think would most \naccurately reflect the overall cost. But on the details of the \nbill, I was not engaged with the members, but I do not think \nthat is what is really relevant here. What is relevant here is \nthat at the time that you all were considering the bill, it was \nthe CBO score that counted, and that is what everybody was \noperating on."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Yes, but I would say this to you: I think \nyou had an obligation, if you believed that the cost was going \nto be far in excess of what CBO was telling us, to say so. I \nwill not go further with it. I just tell you I am personally \ndisappointed that somebody in the administration did not send \nup a very clear signal that, in their judgment, this bill was \ngoing to cost a third again as much as what we were told at the \ntime.\n    You keep saying you are going to cut the deficit in half 5 \nyears from now. The only way you are going to cut the deficit \nin half 5 years from now is just not to count things.\n    Let me ask you this: When you say you are going to cut the \ndeficit in half, you say it is going to be $237 billion. Are \nyou counting the $259 billion you are going to take from Social \nSecurity in that year that you have to pay back? Is that in \nthat?\n    Mr. Bolten. Senator, this administration, as all previous \nadministrations, at least in recent decades, and CBO, looks at \nthe deficit picture on a unified basis. So what counts for \ndeficit purposes is the unified budget deficit or surplus, as \nthe case may be----"
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    But isn't this going to add--isn't that \n$259 billion going to add to the debt of the United States? The \nmoney that is being taken from Social Security in 2009 you have \nto pay back, don't you?\n    Mr. Bolten. Sure. It is a Government obligation. But what--\n--"
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    And that adds to the debt.\n    Mr. Bolten. It does not--it adds to the overall debt of the \nGovernment, but it does not add to the debt held by the public."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Not the debt held by the public, but it \nadds to the gross debt of the United States, and it has got to \nbe paid back.\n    Now, let me just say why I am concerned about this, because \nback in the 1980's there was virtually no Social Security \nsurplus to be concerned about. In 1983, the last time as a \npercentage of GDP we had a deficit as big as this one, there \nwas virtually no Social Security surplus.\n    In this year alone, your estimates are the Social Security \nsurplus is going to be $259 billion, and you are taking it all. \nYou are not taking it all just for that year. You are taking it \nall for the next decade. That is $2.4 trillion--$2.4 trillion--\nand you are not letting the American people understand all that \nhas got to be paid back.\n    But it does not end there. The same thing is true with \nMedicare. The alternative minimum tax, which you are paying for \nfor 1 year, has a cost in 2009 of $55 billion. It is nowhere. \nYou have, in addition to that, no calculation of residual war \ncosts. CBO tells us it is going to be $30 billion that year. \nYou add all that up, that is over $600 billion of added debt \nwhen you are telling the people it is going to be a deficit of \n$237 billion.\n    I think that is misleading to people, and all of this right \nbefore the baby boomers retire.\n    Mr. Bolten. If you can hold the chart up for just 1 second?"
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Yes.\n    Mr. Bolten. Senator, we disagree--not about the problem \nwith Social Security--I share very much your concern about the \nlong-term unfunded liability in Social Security. But in terms \nof correctly describing what our deficit situation is, I think \nthe right way to look at it is on a unified basis, because it \nis what the Government needs to borrow today from the private \nsector or tomorrow from the private sector that is relevant in \nthe concern you expressed at the end of your remarks, which \nwas: Is private capital being crowded out? What is going on \nwith interest rates?\n    Right now we do not see the deficits we are running today \nputting pressure on interest rates, but I think you are right \nto be concerned about it. But the right way to look at it is \nwhat does the Government need to borrow today or tomorrow in \norder to meet that obligation.\n    Let me move on to the other elements. On the Medicare \nsurplus----"
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Let me just respond to that for a moment. I \ntell you, I think we have a fundamentally different \ncircumstance than we faced in the 1980's because the baby \nboomers are about to retire. And the hard reality is debt held \nby the public is a different metric than the gross debt of the \nUnited States. The gross debt of the United States matters a \nlot more when the baby boomers are about to retire. And it is \nwhy, if you look back at the 1980's, there was virtually no \nSocial Security surplus. Now there are huge Social Security \nrevenues coming in, growing dramatically--it produces a $150 \nbillion Social Security surplus this year. It is going to be \n$250 billion by your calculation in just 5 years. And you are \nnot counting it as part of the deficit, when, in fact, it has \nall got to be paid back. It is adding to the debt. And what we \nhave here is a gross debt that is spinning totally out of \ncontrol at the worst possible time.\n    Mr. Bolten. I do want to emphasize that I completely share \nyour concern about the long-term unfunded liability of Social \nSecurity, which begins to bite within the next 10 or 15 years \nvery badly, when Social Security itself will start taking in \nless money than it is putting out. So I do not want to minimize \nconcern about Social Security. I do want to say we have a \ndisagreement about the right way to characterize deficits \ntoday.\n    Looking at some of the other elements on your chart, I \nthink to suggest that there is a Medicare surplus does not tell \nthe actual story, that Medicare is divided into two parts, part \nof which has a trust fund, which is in surplus, but the other \nhalf of Medicare is running a large cash deficit."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    That is true, but we have made a decision \naround here, made it long ago, that we are going to fund \nMedicare in different ways. Some of it was by a premium. Some \nwas by a general fund transfer. We do have a trust fund and it \nis in surplus, and it is being taken and used for other things. \nAnd the point is it has got to be paid back.\n    That is the fundamental problem I have with telling people \nthe deficit is going to be cut in half, because the hard \nreality is that the debt in 2009 is not going to be increased \nby $230 billion. The debt, according to your own calculation, \nif you go to your own budget documents, the debt is going to be \nincreased by $633 billion in 2009. I think the American people \nneed to know that.\n    My time is up.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Conrad, thank you. I am very \ninterested in this subject, and you and I have a little \ndifference of philosophy, and maybe we can hash this out.\n    Senator Conrad and I have basically decided to do a hearing \non long-term cost implications of some of the Federal programs, \nwhich will certainly include Social Security and Medicare, but \nalso other pension liabilities and long-term liabilities. And I \nmay want to have a portion of that or maybe a separate hearing \ndevoted to trust funds and what I would say is the false \nassumption of trust funds, but that would let you know where I \nam coming from. And maybe we could really hash this out. I \nwould enjoy doing that. I think it would be a good, \neducational, intellectual exercise. But we will save that for \nanother day.\n    We go by order of appearance, and I might ask my \ncolleagues, Senator Domenici is here. Senator Allard, would you \nmind deferring to the former chairman, since he has only been \nchairman of this committee or ranking member for 25 years or \nsomething. But we are asking all of our colleagues to try and \nkeep their comments to 5, 6, 7 minutes. That would be \nappreciated.\n    Senator Domenici? And thank you, Senator Allard.\n    Senator Domenici. I will try to be brief.\n    There is one item of kind of a parochial nature that \nbothers me, and parochial only in the sense that the \nsubcommittee that I chair has to pay for this. That has to do \nwith Yucca Mountain, Mr. Director. There is something very \ndifficult about what your budget is doing on Yucca Mountain.\n    First of all, you propose that there be a Yucca Mountain \nfee. There has always been a fee accumulating for that. We use \nit even when we are not making any headway, but the President \nproposes $749 million as a legislative proposal related to \nYucca Mountain that would change mandatory receipts related to \nthe nuclear waste to discretionary receipts. Is that correct so \nfar?\n    Mr. Bolten. I believe it is, Senator.\n    Senator Domenici. OK. In the budget request, the revenue \nfrom this change is assumed up front, and it is the means to \nmaintain the schedule of 2010 opening of Yucca.\n    Now, I do not know that Yucca is going to be opened by \n2010, so I do not want to act like I am agreeing with that \ndate. But you all are and everybody else is telling the world \nwe are.\n    Now, what happens if this legislative proposal is not \nenacted? Will we still stay on a path that assumes a 2010 \nopening?\n    Mr. Bolten. My expectation, Senator, is that unless we are \nable to find some other way to make sure that the funding for \nthis project is adequate that it would cause a delay in the \n2010 date.\n    Senator Domenici. Well, it would seem to me that is the \nright answer, but also I would like you to know that very few \nproposals for a user fee of this size gets enacted around here. \nAnd when you have something as controversial as Yucca, whose \nschedule has been all over, to come along and say, well, now is \nthe time to ask for $750 million as a new fee, there are going \nto be a lot of people complaining because they have been \nputting up a fee, Mr. Chairman, for a long time. And you have \nbeen asking me, ``Where is the fee?'' And I say, ``It is \nsitting out there.'' And then you say to me, ``No, it isn't \nsitting out there. You are using it.'' Right? ``Except you are \nnot using it for Yucca.''\n    Well, now, I personally want everybody to know that I will \ndo what I can on Yucca, but I cannot keep it on schedule with \n$750 million left out that we assume we are going to get when I \ndo not know how we are going to get it.\n    Mr. Bolten. Senator, one comment. I am advised that the \nfees we are talking about are not new fees. It is a shifting of \nfees from the mandatory over to the discretionary side. I \nrealize that that still involves some difficult legislative \nmachinations, but----\n    Senator Domenici. Yes, sir. But, you see, I already told \nyou that, and I thought you were not getting it. But, you know, \nI already made that statement about the discretionary, this \nchange. I note your marvelous assistant just whispered it in \nyour ear.\n    Mr. Bolten. Senator, you are both far more astute about \nthis than I am, sir.\n    Senator Domenici. You are right. He is pretty good, too. He \nworked for us for 20 years.\n    Let me talk about the defense environmental management, if \nI could. The fiscal year 2005 requests $350 million to be made \navailable only to the extent that legal uncertainty concerning \ncertain reprocessing is satisfactorily resolved pending \nlitigation or by new legislation. What does that mean?\n    Mr. Bolten. I am not familiar with that, Senator.\n    Senator Domenici. Well, it is a bunch of money. I do not \nknow that you have to be, but somebody has to be. Do you want \nto ask somebody to tell us--\n    Mr. Bolten. Can we give you the answers for the record?\n    Senator Domenici. Absolutely. Thank you very much.\n    The rest of that is: When do you intend to obligate that \n$350 million? And we will wait for that answer, too.\n    Mr. Bolten. We will provide that for the record, Senator.\n    Senator Domenici. Thank you very much.\n    Corps of Engineers. Everybody around here knows, and \nprobably Senator Byrd knows the best, that every year \nPresidents submit budgets on the Corps of Engineers that ask \nfor projects and then do not pay for them, or cut the projects \nso much knowing full well that you cannot live with them.\n    Now, I do not accuse you of it. You are too new. But you \nare following in the footpaths, it would seem, of those that \ncame before you.\n    The Corps of Engineers fiscal year 2005 request, if enacted \nas is, underfunds the Corps so much that I question whether it \ncould be effectively carried out and that it could do its \nmandated work. The fiscal year 2005 budget documents relating \nto the Corps state a concern about the growing construction \nbacklog.\n    Can you explain how if we cut the construction budget by \n$300 million we are reducing the current construction backlog \nfor 2005? Would you like to answer that for the record, too?\n    Mr. Bolten. I might, but I would just say, Senator, that \nwhen we have gone in and looked at that budget, what we have \ntried to do is focus on the priority projects, those already \nunder way. I think the Corps does a pretty good job of trying \nto figure out exactly where the resources ought to be \nallocated. We have tried to continue doing that in this budget.\n    Senator Domenici. OK. I have three more Corps questions. I \nwill submit them. But let me say to the Senators, there is no \nseries of projects that the Senators want more than the Corps \nof Engineers. If anybody served on that subcommittee, it gets \nthe biggest list, short of maybe Interior, which you chaired, \nSenator Byrd. We get lists of requests for Corps, and if I look \nat your numbers, it is--you know, you have submitted to us an \nimpossibility. We cannot do what you have suggested here \nbecause the Senate Members and House Members will not let us.\n    Now, on a very big issue, I would like you to talk with us \na minute. It seems to me the American economy is changing or \nsomething has happened that we have not yet put our finger on. \nThe easy attack on this administration is that two million jobs \nhave been lost, and I see a candidate saying, ``Wait until I \nget President Bush, I will point right in his forehead and say, \n`That is what you have done, lost two million jobs.'''\n    Well, Mr. Bolten, it seems to me that with the fiscal \nfacts, everything is right on course for this to be a very \nstrong economy. Normally a strong economy means more jobs. Is \nthat not right?\n    Mr. Bolten. Yes, sir.\n    Senator Domenici. What has happened? Why do we have all \nthese good acts on the economy? We have a few things that are \nstrange, and that is this enormous, enormous increase in \nproductivity, consistent and so high that 15 years ago if you \nhad told Alan Greenspan we are going to have it that big, you \nknow, he would have said it is impossible. A couple other \nthings have happened. Do you have your version on behalf of \nthis President as to why all the growth and other positive \nthings and so few new jobs as they are talking about?\n    Mr. Bolten. Well, a couple of points. First of all, I think \nthe macroeconomic policy has been very well designed to address \nthe recessionary situation that the President encountered when \nhe entered office. There has been an accommodative monetary \npolicy from the Fed, and on the fiscal side, you all have done \nexactly the right thing in enacting what may be the best timed \ntax cuts in American history.\n    CEA estimates that those tax cuts are responsible for two \nmillion more jobs. The Council of Economic Advisers, the \nprofessional economists within the White House, estimate that \nbetween 2001 and 2003, there were two million more jobs in the \neconomy as a result of the tax cuts than there otherwise would \nhave been.\n    Now, job growth has been too slow, and it has been, as you \nknow, a great concern of the President. One of the reasons is \nroutine, and that is that job growth typically lags recovery, \nand it takes some time, once the recovery is under way, for job \ngrowth to come back. But a huge factor is the one you \nmentioned, which is that productivity growth has been \nunprecedented, far beyond anything that any of the economists \nprojected, which is good news for the economy overall. It means \nwe are going to remain competitive. It means that we are going \nto have higher real wage rates. But it also means in the short \nrun, when you are coming out of a recovery, that there aren't \nas many jobs created because high productivity means you are \ncreating more products with fewer people.\n    We expect that the trend of low job growth is now moving to \nsustained job growth. We need to see what the numbers will be \ngoing forward, but I know that our economists are very \noptimistic that we will see strong job growth in the years \nahead.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Domenici, thank you very much.\n    I am going to urge our colleagues, we have a tool that we \ndid not have in the Senate, and there is a little clock up \nthere to give us a little guidance.\n    Senator Murray."
"murray","Senator Murray","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Mr. Chairman, thank you very much, and I \nappreciate the accommodation of the House in being here. I \nwould ask, Mr. Chairman, since many of our offices are not open \nand we are going to have difficulty getting things to you, if \nwe could hold the record open of this committee hearing to \nsubmit our questions once our staffs get back int our office to \nbe able to do that.\n    Chairman Nickles. Certainly. That is an excellent \nsuggestion. Thank you."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    I just have to say that I am really concerned about the \nbudget that has been presented to us by the President. I go \nhome every weekend to Washington State. We have had the first \nor second highest unemployment since September 11th. We are now \nfourth highest, you know, so that feels a little better. But it \nis not good, and what people in my State are really worried \nabout is health care, the cost of health care. They are \nconcerned about jobs. They are concerned about an investment in \ntransportation. They are especially concerned about security. \nAnd what I see in this budget, which is a statement of \npriorities, is a real lack of investment in those, and I want \nto get to that in just a second.\n    But I just got your opening statement this morning and \nlistened to you give it, and I was kind of befuddled by what \nyou were presenting to us because, as Senator Conrad has \npointed out, you are telling us all that the deficit will be \nreduced by half, and you are sending over legislation to kind \nof make that happen. You talked about reinstating caps, the \npay-as-you-go requirements, but you are saying tax increases, \npay-as-you-go would not apply.\n    Well, I do not understand how that works when the tax cuts \ntake money out of the budget. And I know what you are going to \ngo to is that, well, they will create jobs. But what I think we \nhave seen and part of what Senator Domenici was talking about \nis that the jobs are not being created here. Many of the \ncorporations who are taking advantage of tax cuts are having \njobs go overseas, and we are not seeing people here, as you \npredict, create a better revenue forecast in the future by \nincreasing taxes because they are not being paid here.\n    Now, I am a supporter of trade agreements, but I think we \nhave to ask the question: If tax cuts are put in place \npermanently and the jobs are not created here, how are we ever \ngoing to get to a deficit that is cut in half that is being \npromised by this budget and by the White House?\n    Mr. Bolten. Senator, first, the tax cuts that we are \ntalking about and the ones we are proposing be made permanent \nin the Code are not corporate tax cuts. These are individual \ntaxes that we are talking about."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    But I would assume that you are saying that \nthese people will invest back in this economy. That is not what \nwe are seeing.\n    Mr. Bolten. They will invest, and in particular with \nrespect to the top rates, many of the small businesses of \nAmerica, Subchapter S corporations, pay their taxes through the \ntop income tax rates. And these are not people typically who \nare sending their jobs overseas. These are people who are \ninvesting, buying plant and equipment here in America. They are \nthe real engines of job growth."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    I think we are all very concerned that \nwhere we are seeing job growth is not here in this country, and \nI do not want to get into an agreement on that. Just an \nobservation that we are not going to cut the deficit in half if \nwe continue to give tax cuts out. We see no job growth here, \nand it is a dynamic that we are going to have to deal with as a \ncountry.\n    But let me ask you a specific question, because it is one I \nam deeply concerned about. You said one of the priorities of \nthis budget was protecting the homeland. I do not think any of \nus disagrees with that. I think all of us realize that this \nlast week three Senate office buildings were shut down because \nof a small bit of ricin. I would let all of you know that if \none container comes into any one of our seaports in this \ncountry, we now understand the dramatic impact to this economy \nif those seaports were to be shut down and the products that \ncould not get to stores in the middle of the country, let alone \nthe jobs that are lost immediately on our ports, and, of \ncourse, the lives that would be involved in that.\n    I was really disappointed to see that this administration \nidentified $1.7 billion for Coast Guard port, waterway, and \ncoastal security activities, including $100 million for the \nimplementation of the Maritime Transportation Security Act as a \nport security initiative.\n    First of all, Mr. Chairman, I want to point out that the \nCoast Guard commandant testified last September that it would \ntake approximately $7.3 billion over 10 years to implement the \nMaritime Transportation Security Act, including $1.5 billion \nfor the first year. So this program is woefully underfunded, \nand that $1.7 billion figure represents 90 percent of the \nadministration's proposed port security budget, and about half \nof the Coast Guard's discretionary budget for its traditional \nmissions of port, waterway, coastal security.\n    The Coast Guard is doing an excellent job. Any of us who \nlive on coastal States will tell you that. But they are \nstretched to the max. They are working overtime, long hours, \nand I do not think this budget offers any relief.\n    I want to know how this administration expects the Coast \nGuard, which is already stretched thin, to accomplish its \ntraditional missions, including fisheries enforcement, search \nand rescue, all of those, take on 90 percent of the homeland \nsecurity duties, and implement MTSA with only 7 percent--that \nis $100 million of the $1.5 billion--of what the commandant has \ntold us they need.\n    Mr. Bolten. Senator, we have the Coast Guard very \nsubstantially funded. I agree completely. They have taken on a \ngreat burden. They do a terrific job. The Coast Guard funding \nover the course of this administration has been dramatically \nincreased. We are proposing in this budget----"
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    At the behest of Congress, I would add, \nnot----\n    Mr. Bolten. Yes, with the cooperation of Congress. I think \nwe agree that that is an area that has needed a great deal of \nstrengthening in this country. The overall budget for the Coast \nGuard in our 2005 submission increased by 9 percent in total. \nThe port security program you referred to, I think we have \nbaked into our figures full over the course of the 10-year \nperiod. But we need to focus our money where we think we can do \nthe most good most quickly."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    Well, I would just disagree with the \npriorities, and I would say eliminating Operation Safe \nCommerce, which is a project that is ongoing in our largest \nports right now to determine what is the best way to provide \nport security, eliminating that and underfunding this is going \nto cost us in the future. And it makes it very hard to believe \nthat homeland security is one of the primary missions of this \nbudget.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Murray, thank you very much.\n    Senator Allard.\n    Senator Allard. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would have to \ndisagree with my colleague from Washington in that what I am \nseeing now is that we are starting to have some job growth. But \nI would also point out, in visiting with economists, it seems \nas though there has been a loss of manufacturing jobs for \nalmost two decades. Whether we have gone through periods of \nrecession or unprecedented growth like we did in the 1990's, \nthe trend has been a loss of manufacturing jobs in this \ncountry.\n    It has brought up a discussion among a number of colleagues \nthat I have been visiting with as to just how significant is \nthe household survey as compared to, I guess, we call it the \npayroll survey, where we do the--where most of the figures are \ncoming out of, historically I think it has been out of the \npayroll survey. What we have noticed recently, there has been a \nhuge increase in household survey that reflects small business \njobs. And I have talked to a number of individuals, a number of \neconomists and people sort of in the various industries. They \nseem to think that with the recession that we had, people were \ngiven bonuses to leave their jobs voluntarily, and they took \nthis money and set up their own businesses. Many of them were \nhome businesses, the household. They operated a computer and \nthey had a good printer, and they ran a business right out of \ntheir home.\n    Do you have any explanation for the discrepancy in the \nhousehold figures as opposed to the payroll figures?\n    Mr. Bolten. Senator, for a truly expert answer, I will ask \nthe Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to give you \nsomething for the record. But I think the difference is exactly \nthe one you identified, and that is that the payroll survey \ntends to go around and get the big businesses and survey their \nemployment. The household survey actually asks individuals who \nis doing what, and that is the one that reflects much more \naccurately small businesses, and as has been typical in many \nrecoveries, the real robust growth in the economy, and the real \njob creation comes from the small businesses.\n    Senator Sessions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think it is \ncritical that we take firm and decisive steps to demonstrate \nour commitment as a Congress to contain the growth in spending. \nThe American people expect that. The financial community is \nwatching us, and I think the world community is watching us.\n    We can sustain the deficits we had this year. I was glad to \nsee that it came in, what, $50 billion below one of the \nestimates as late as June because of the growth in the economy, \nand it does appear to me that income to the Government from tax \nrevenues is more volatile than the economy itself. It tends to \ngo up faster and drop faster than the economy itself. But one \nof the things we have not talked about generally is the \ndiscretionary and entitlement accounts. We have focused mostly \non discretionary.\n    Mr. Bolten, what percentage of our expenditures in this \nunified budget from which you are drawing the deficit number, \nwhat percentage of that is discretionary and what percentage is \nentitlement programs?\n    Mr. Bolten. It is about a one-third/two-thirds \nrelationship, and then the interest is the rest of the budget.\n    Senator Sessions. So two-thirds of the expenditures other \nthan interest would be entitlement programs, Social Security, \nMedicare and those expenditure items?\n    Mr. Bolten. I think it is a little bit less than two-\nthirds, yes.\n    Senator Sessions. And we do not appropriate that money as \nwe have set that system up, but every single American who \nreaches a certain age or has certain income levels become \nentitled automatically to the check or the benefit from the \nGovernment regardless of the state of the government's budget \nand income; is that correct?\n    Mr. Bolten. That is true.\n    Senator Sessions. Will the entitlement program growth \nexceed the growth projected by the President for the \ndiscretionary accounts this year?\n    Mr. Bolten. This year actually I think entitlement growth \nhas been relatively restrained after a number of years of large \ngrowth, but it is not a path we can expect to continue in the \nfuture. But if you look out into the future and if you look out \nfarther beyond 10 years into the future, as Senator Conrad did \nwith his charts, and I know a number of members are interested \nin, you see in the entitlement growth far outstripping not just \nthe growth in the rest of the budget, but the growth in the \neconomy which is what makes that situation particularly \ndangerous.\n    Senator Sessions. I think it is important. So the answer is \non Social Security, we know it is time for us in this Congress \nto get serious about it. We do not need to wait till 2018 when \nthe thing goes into deficit. We need to be thinking ahead now. \nI think the President has had the courage to discuss that \nopenly, and I believe he will move forward, and I hope the \nCongress will meet him halfway instead of politicizing the \nissue.\n    Now, one matter we need to deal with--and I am glad the \nChairman raised it--and that is the prescription drug cost \nestimates that we had. Chairman Nickles, to his credit, told us \non the floor of the Senate and in Committee and privately, that \nthe numbers were probably going to exceed the $400 billion. \nNobody else particularly was saying that, but Chairman Nickles \ndid warn us of it. I told the people of my State that I believe \nwe needed a prescription drug plan, I believe and know that \nthere are seniors in our State who literally, whose health is \ncompromised because they cannot afford prescription drugs. And \nI thought and was certain we could do it for the amount we \nbudgeted last year, $400 billion, and I ran for reelection and \nthat is what I said. So I have to tell you, I am very disturbed \nand concerned that we now have another Government agency saying \nit is going to be $534 billion which is $134 billion more. That \nis $13 billion a year. I do not know where in this Government \nwe can save $13 billion a year. And this is a program going \nfrom zero to 400 billion and now it is going up to there.\n    I will just say a couple of things. Do you know which \nnumber is correct, and do you have an opinion? Is it 400 or \n534?\n    Mr. Bolten. I do not know, Senator. I think even people who \nare expert in this area have legitimate disagreements. I know \nthat the CBO actuaries are very professional. The HHS actuaries \nare very professional. And they are working together to try to \nresolve their differences.\n    Senator Sessions. I do not think we know either, and I have \nbeen talking to a number of Senators about this, and others in \ntrying to figure out what the truth is, and the truth is we do \nnot know. The truth is we passed a bill that we said was a $400 \nbillion bill and now we have an authoritative agency saying it \nis going to be $134 billion more than that. So I think before \nthis thing gets implemented, before we go down this road, Mr. \nChairman, we need to confront this question. I believe that is \nwhat the Congress was intending. I know I would not have voted \nfor a $534 billion bill, and I know other Senators would not \nhave voted that big a bill.\n    So my question to you is, would you be willing to support, \nand do you think the administration would support a plan to \ncontain the growth of this new entitlement program to the 400 \nbillion we contemplated from the beginning, and would not that \nbe good public policy, so if Congress felt they needed to put \nmore money in it to drive it up, they could make that decision, \nbut that we ought to have a budget that we enforce and we ought \nto have an expenditure plan that is consistent with what we \nexpected when we passed the bill?\n    Mr. Bolten. Senator, I cannot give you an administration \nposition off the top of my head on that. I can tell you that, \nthe administration remains very interested in ensuring that \ncosts be contained at the same time that we are providing these \nnew and improved benefits through Medicare. So there will \nalways be an interest in that.\n    And I would just come back to one point, which is that as \nwe submit this budget, I expect it will be rescored by CBO, and \nmy understanding is that they will stay with their $395 billion \nestimate. So as the budget is in front of you, it will be at \nthe same cost for the Medicare program that you voted on.\n    Senator Sessions. I think that could be helpful to us, Mr. \nChairman, as we confront the question of can we contain this \ncost to the amount we intended to. I believe we can do that. We \ndo not know what it is going to be. In fact, you have \nindicated, I think, we do not know to the extent it could be \nmore than $534 billion, and I just think we have a \nresponsibility to see what we can do to make this program come \nin at the level we want it to. The idea that entitlement \nprogram is just a machine let loose and it runs amuck and can \nnever be altered should not be our way of thinking.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Sessions, thank you. I welcome \nany suggestions that you have. I might say that during the \nconference I tried with others to come up with different \nmethods of containing the cost, and we came up with a reporting \nmechanism if spending exceeds a certain amount of GDP or \nsomething, but it was not anything satisfactory as far as this \nSenator is concerned.\n    Senator Sessions. I would just say that of all the \nconferees, you are by far the most committed to maintaining \nintegrity in that figure, and perhaps the growing concern over \nthe deficit in recent weeks might cause some of our colleagues \nto rethink where we are on this particular question. If we can \ncome up with a good sound approach, and I believe we can, we \nneed to do it.\n    Chairman Nickles. I appreciate your suggestion, and the \nadministration has made several recommendations as far as \nbudgetary changes. Either they would be made as part of the \nbudget resolution or they would be made as a separate bill as \npart of amending the Budget Act. I am certainly willing to \nconsider recommendations from any member of the Committee, any \nmember of the Senate. So if you have some suggestions you think \nthat we should be considering, I am more than willing to work \nwith Senator Conrad to see what we can do.\n    Senator Sessions. And I do intend to be working on that, \nMr. Chairman.\n    Chairman Nickles. I appreciate that.\n    Next, the Senator from Michigan, Senator Stabenow."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","murray","Senator Murray","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking \nMember, and welcome, Mr. Bolten.\n    I am looking forward to a broader discussion on Medicare \nmyself. I will not spend a lot of time on it today, but just to \nsay what I would really like to talk about is how this is not a \ngood benefit for seniors, how it lacks in the highest possible \nprices for people under Medicare, and in over 10 years will \nbegin to unravel Medicare as we know it. So I hope we are not \nonly talking about the numbers but it is really happening and \nwhat will be happening under this Medicare bill which I am \ndeeply concerned about for the seniors of the country.\n    There is a lot in this budget bill. It is difficult to \nspend just a few moments talking about it, so, Mr. Chairman, I \nwould like to talk in big picture numbers. As I said in the \nlast meeting that we had, last hearing, I think it is very \nimportant to note that with all this sea of red ink, that if we \nwere to eliminate every penny of non-defense discretionary \ndomestic spending this year, every penny of $445 billion this \nyear, that would not eliminate the deficit for this year of \n$521 billion; is that not correct?\n    Mr. Bolten. That is true, Senator."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    This is huge. So we can debate around the \nmargins about whether or not we should have a half a percent \nincrease in non-defense discretionary spending or a percent or \n2 percent. But you could eliminate every penny and it would not \nequal the deficit for this 1 year. So obviously, there are \nbroader issues that we need to address, Mr. Chairman, and I \nhope we will.\n    The other thing I think is important to put in perspective \nis of the 65 programs that we are talking about being \neliminated, and I have some questions about those, they equal 5 \nbillion which is what we spend a month in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nSo we are talking about and trumpeting 65 programs that \neliminate $5 billion, and we can debate whether they should be \nor not, and I am all for eliminating things that do not work \nand doing new things, but that is what--we are spending $5 \nbillion a month in Iraq and Afghanistan, and this budget does \nnot include the funding at this point for those important \nissues of Iraq and Afghanistan. So this budget is not complete, \nwhich is one of the big concerns as we look at all of this.\n    Is it true, when I look at what you are proposing to \neliminate, we are looking at eliminating in education $1.412, \nbasically a billion dollars in education, as I have it, \neducation programs, and I assume these numbers are correct that \nwe have received from you, $1.412 billion. And adding back $1 \nbillion in Title I. So we are looking at overall there would be \na cut there in terms of dollars to education. That concerns me.\n    The other thing, coming from a manufacturing State, right \nnow, where our world is very different than the world, with all \ndue respect, that you are describing in terms of jobs. We are \nlosing jobs and we are losing them permanently, middle class \nfamily wage jobs, and we are desperately concerned about it. \nEveryone is agreed. The President has said, and Members of \nCongress obviously have said, we need to focus on education and \ninnovation. We see programs being cut as it relates to \ntechnology, regional technology in education programs, as well \nas vocational education, as well as other kinds of tech prep \neducation, those kinds of things. Then we see being proposed \nfor cuts the Advanced Technology Program, which frankly, has \nbeen a wonderful partnership in Michigan between the \nuniversities, the big three auto makers, other manufacturers to \nincrease our applied technologies in terms of research and \nbeing able to raise that level of innovation that we all know \nthat we need to compete. So I am very concerned about the \nchoices being made here that will undercut our ability to in \nfact invest in education, innovation and jobs.\n    I would add just one other thing on jobs, and that is I \nwould comment--I do not usually commend a program on \ntelevision--but Lou Dobbs has been doing a wonderful ongoing \nseries on exporting of American jobs, ``Exporting of America'' \nI believe is what he calls it, in which he really, I believe \nthe other night got into the whole question of how we look at \nproductivity now. Part of the reason that productivity numbers \nlook as high as they are is because we are taking out of the \nequation the numbers of jobs that are being outsourced overseas \nso that the numbers change, and there is some very interesting \nthings that I thought came forward in this program.\n    So I am more specking, Mr. Chairman, than I am asking \nquestions, except to say I am very concerned about the choices \nbeing made here in terms of education innovation, the choices \nin terms of keeping us safe and the cuts in first responders \nand bioterrorism. And I would ask simply a question as we look \nat these things. We all understand that Social Security and \nMedicare is being included in the numbers that we see in terms \nof the deficit, correct?\n    Mr. Bolten. Correct."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    Unified budget. Would you also agree with \na chart that our ranking member has showed us in the past \nregarding borrowing, the top 10 countries holding our national \ndebt, China, Japan. By the way, China is where our jobs are \ngoing is one of the places, and then manipulating their \ncurrency which makes it worse. Japan, China, United Kingdom, \nHong Kong, Germany, OPEC and so on. Would you agree with the \nfact that we are borrowing, that we are taking Social Security \nand Medicare money, and on top of that we are borrowing from \nother countries in order to take care of this debt at this \ntime?\n    Mr. Bolten. Oh, it is certainly true that a fair amount of \nthe U.S. debt is held overseas, yes, and that is one reason why \nit is especially important that we show ourselves to be \nfiscally responsible today because we need to be assuring not \nonly our own markets but international markets as well."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    Absolutely. So when we look at this \nbudget and the fact that you could eliminate all education \nfunding and homeland security and technology innovation and law \nenforcement and everything, and not equal the deficit this \nyear, and you look at the fact that we are taking all of Social \nSecurity and Medicare and borrowing from China and Japan, Mr. \nChairman, what I find of great concern is that that money is \nnot going back into paying our bills. For the most part, that \nhas gone as a conscious choice to give tax cuts that you want \nto extend to people who are doing very, very well in our \ncountry. So we are taking money from Social Security and \nMedicare, borrowing from China and Japan and other countries, \ngiving it to millionaires in our country, and then not being \nable to pay our debt on the war, not being able to invest in \neducation innovation.\n    These are choices that are being made right now in this \nbudget and in the past several budgets, and I disagree with \nthose choices. I believe that this budget is about values and \npriorities, and I do not believe that right now this budget \nreflects priorities. Thank you.\n    Mr. Bolten. Mr. Chairman, may I take a moment for a comment \nor would you like to move on?\n    Chairman Nickles. Yes, go ahead.\n    Mr. Bolten. I agree completely with the Senator, that that \nis exactly what these budgets are about, setting priorities. I \nimagine we will have some substantial disagreements about where \nthe priorities belong.\n    Let me make one point about the tax cuts that you raised \nbecause I think there is a misconception about the effect of \nthose tax cuts. This chart shows basically who pays what in our \nincome tax system. Right now, let us take the top 5 percent of \nincome earners in this country. That is the second set of bars \nfrom the left. Without the tax cuts, that group, those people \nmaking more than $135,000 a year, pay 50 percent of the income \ntax in this country. As a result of the income tax cuts, that \nsame group pays 53 percent of the income tax take in this \ncountry. The result of the tax cuts that you all enacted was to \nmake the tax code more progressive rather than less.\n    I would also come back to the point that a substantial \nportion of the money that is labeled as going to the rich is \nfor the small businesses of America, which are, as Senator \nAllard was pointing out, the job creators in this economy.\n    Can I mention a couple more things?\n    Chairman Nickles. I have two additional Senators and I am \ntrying to get this out pretty close to 12 o'clock.\n    Mr. Bolten. All right, sir. I will be glad to engage the \nSenator separately."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    Mr. Chairman, if I can just make one \nresponse with two points. First of all, income tax is not the \nonly thing paid in this country.\n    Mr. Bolten. Absolutely."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    Everyone is paying payroll taxes.\n    Mr. Bolten. Yes."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    The majority of Americans are paying \npayroll taxes which is Social Security and Medicare that we are \nnow using to help pay for these income tax cuts as well as \nother things.\n    But second, the majority of this income tax cut went to \nthose at the very top of our income. Child credit, terrific; \neliminating the marriage penalty, I care about that more now, \nthe last year, than I did the year before."
break,break,break,break
"","","","","    [Laughter.]"
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    And I certainly appreciate what you are \nsaying about small business, but we all know where the majority \nof this went, and in fact, if you would be willing to work with \nus, we could eliminate what happened to those at the very top \nwho have not been asked to sacrifice during this time of war, \nand reinvest it back into helping our homeland security first \nresponders keep us safe, and I think we could have some common \nground.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Stabenow, thank you very much.\n    The Senator from Idaho, Senator Crapo.\n    Senator Crapo. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n    I want to first add my voice to those who are raising a \nhigh level of concern about the level of deficits that our \ncountry is facing now. There is a tremendous debate starting in \nthis country about why we are facing these deficits, where the \nresponsibility lies, and I am sure that given the fact that it \nis a Presidential election year and there is a battle for \ncontrol of the Senate and the House, that there is going to be \na tremendous amount of rhetoric about these deficits.\n    I want to commend you, Mr. Bolten, and the President for \nsubmitting a budget that focuses on trying to reduce the level \nof these deficits and get us on to a glide path back toward \nbalance. My efforts in this Committee are probably going to be \nto help increase the pace at which we engage in those efforts, \nbut I appreciate that this budget recognizes that need.\n    Second, and I want to use my time here, I want to commend \nyou and the President for recognizing that procedure, as we \nadopt budgets, is critical.\n    Mr. Chairman, could you help me on my information here, \nSenator Nickles? Last year when we brought our 2004 budget \nresolution to the Senate floor, did we not consider something \nlike 80 or 81 admendments and were not the vast majority of \nthose efforts to increase the level of spending assumed by the \nresolution?\n    Chairman Nickles. The Senator is correct. 81 amendments, \nmost of those were to increase spending. I am trying to \nremember if there was one or two to cut spending, but most all \nthose were significant increases, most of which were defeated.\n    Senator Crapo. And when you say ``most'' we are talking \nlike 95 to 100 percent almost of those 81 votes were votes to \ntry to increase the spending level of the budget.\n    Chairman Nickles. The Senator is correct.\n    Senator Crapo. The reason I say that is--and I appreciate \nyou pointing out that we were successful in all but one of them \nin defeating them. The reason we were successful in defeating \nthem is we had some budget protection measures in place that \nrequired 60 votes to increase the budget rather than 50. If we \nhad not had those budget protections in place, it is hard to \nimagine what the spending levels we would be dealing with today \nmight have been.\n    The reason I go into that is because it is my understanding \nthat in addition to the proposals for the actual numbers of \nthis year's budget, that the administration is recommending a \nnumber of specific statutory budget process changes to help us \ncontrol spending. I want to just go over a few of those to get \nthose clarified.\n    The first is, I understand that you are proposing that we \nreinstate caps on discretionary spending for five full years; \nis that correct?\n    Mr. Bolten. That is correct, Senator.\n    Senator Crapo. Second, I understand that you are proposing \na pay-as-you-go requirement similar to that that we have used \nin the past for new mandatory spending, and that this proposal \nwould require that any increases in mandatory spending would \nhave to be offset by reductions in mandatory spending, and that \ntax increases could not be utilized for that offset; is that \ncorrect?\n    Mr. Bolten. Also correct, Senator.\n    Senator Crapo. I know that earlier in the hearing there was \nsome argument with that notion, namely the notion that tax \nincreases should not be allowed. I want to first of all weigh \nin on your side on that and ask you to explain it a little \nmore, because it seems to me that there are two, at least two \nmajor objectives here that we want to achieve. One is we want \nto balance our budget, but the second is--and I think this is \nsort of an age-old battle that we have here in Washington--is \nthat we want to try to restrain the growth of the Federal \nbudget and the growth of the Federal Government. There are \nthose who I think believe that we need to have a large all-\npowerful centralized economy controlled by the Federal \nGovernment. I am not in that group. There are others who \nbelieve that we ought to have the Federal Government performing \nthose limited functions contemplated by the Constitution, and \nthat we should try to do all we can while we are trying to \nmaintain a balanced budget, to also obtain the second \nobjective, which is a restrained growth of the Federal \nGovernment. I mean you can easily balance a budget. Just pass a \ntax increase. Every time you want to spend more money, tax \nmore, keep the budget balanced and just watch the Government \ngrow. But we want to control growth as well as achieve balance. \nI assume that that was the principle behind your proposal to \nnot allow tax increases to be utilized as the mechanism. Am I \ncorrect?\n    Mr. Bolten. Yes, Senator, I think that is very well stated. \nIn fact, it is better stated than I did in my last hearing, so \nI am going to go back to the transcript and borrow from that.\n    But there is one other point as well, and that is that the \neconomists will tell us that a spending cut and a tax increase \nare not equal in their effect on the economy, that a spending \ncut will reduce deficits basically one for one, maybe even a \nlittle bit more with the interest expense added in. A tax \nincrease poses the prospect of undermining the economy. There \nis at a minimum a small--though some economists believe a very \nlarge-feedback effect from keeping that money in the economy, \nkeeping economic growth robust, which keeps Treasury revenues \nrobust. Those are the elements that I think also mitigate very \nstrongly in favor of biasing the rules in favor of keeping \nspending down, rather than just focusing on increasing taxes.\n    Senator Crapo. Thank you. In fact, I think that analysis is \nvery appropriate. I am going to add that to my explanations of \nthis issue as we go forward.\n    I would also say just quickly with regard to this proposal, \nI wish it was applicable to mandatory and discretionary \nspending and not just increases. But I will leave that to some \nfurther battles that we have here in the Budget Committee.\n    One last quick question. Among a number of other procedural \nproposals you are making, one of them is to reinstitute the \nline-item veto. As we all know that was stricken by the court \nrecently when we tried it last time. How are you proposing to \ndo it differently now to avoid successful court challenges?\n    Mr. Bolten. Senator, I am not able to go into the legal \ndetail with you now but I know our lawyers are confident that a \nrenewed line item proposal could be crafted that would \nwithstand Constitutional attack in the courts. We will be glad \nto give you that detailed legal analysis.\n    Senator Crapo. If you could submit some further analysis on \nthat I would be very interested in that.\n    I see my time is up. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Crapo, thank you very much. Next \nour colleague from Florida, Senator Nelson."
"nelson","Senator Nelson","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    Mr. Chairman, you are a biblical scholar \nand given the fact that Senator Byrd had made note of the \nmagnificent biblical name of our witness, Joshua, and the fact \nthat--by the way, what great name, Joshua Nehemiah, and I got \nBill. Yet, it is interesting to note about the great leader \nthat Joshua was when he led the people into the promised land \nand had one victory after another until deceit, deception and \nuntruth entered the camp, and then he lost his first battle \nwhen he tried to take the city of Ai. And not until he \nexorcized the untruths did the favorable hand of the Lord turn \nback on him to continue his victories in the promised land.\n    Now I want to point out one little subtle change here. \nWould you all put back up that chart that you just had up \nthere? This chart would lead us to believe that of the top 1 \npercent, 5 percent or 10 percent, they are paying the huge \nshare of income taxes. That is what the chart basically says. \nTechnically, that is correct. But that does not give the whole \npicture about where the burden is upon the American taxpayer, \nfor we know that of the American taxpayer, three-quarters of \nthem are paying more in payroll taxes than they are in income \ntaxes. Is that not approximately true?\n    Mr. Bolten. I do not know the exact numbers but the general \nconcept is right. There are a huge number of, especially lower \nand middle-income taxpayers for whom the tax burden is greatest \nthrough the payroll tax rather than the income tax."
"nelson","Senator Nelson","nelson","Senator Nelson","    So as we try to craft an economic document, \nand this is not particularly an economic document--it is a \npolitical document--we need to tell the whole story of where \nthe tax burden is and how, if we are going to provide relief, \nwho that relief is being provided to.\n    I would submit that this is a political document of a \nbudget--and I do this respectfully--that would offer an \nadditional tax cut for the people at the higher end of the \nincome scale paid for by borrowing. And where do we borrow \nfrom? We borrow from the Social Security Trust Fund, and as \nothers have pointed out here we borrow from--you think we \nborrow from individual American citizens but a good part of the \nborrowing comes from countries like China and Japan.\n    So we have a document in front of us that is increasing the \ndeficits, and what I would like for you to educate me on is, \nwith this kind of deficit now in excess of $500 billion dollars \nin 1 year, is it not the law of physics applied to economics \nthat as you go out and try to accumulate and borrow more and \nmore, and the competition gets greater for the available \ndollars, that the cost of that money goes up, which is the \ninterest rate? Are we not going to see with this budget, if \nimplemented, later on at the end of this year interest rates \nstart to rise, and is that not going to cause the economy to \nstall and ultimately go off the cliff? I would love to have \nyour comments on that.\n    Mr. Bolten. Senator, we have not seen it so far, that \ninterest rates remain at historic low levels, but I think you, \nSenator Conrad and Senator Nickles, are right to be concerned \nabout that and that is why we want to have as restrained a \nbudget as we possibly can, even in the short run. The number \nthat the economists tell us is actually most relevant for what \nyou are concerned about, that is putting upward pressure on \ninterest rates, is the debt to GDP ratio. That is the total \ncorpus of the debt that is being built up in this country.\n    You will see in our tables that we show that debt to GDP \nratio has been rising. I believe with a great deal of \ncredibility our budget will put us on the right path. In the \nPresident's Budget that number peaks in 2004 at around 4.5 \npercent of GDP. This is below the average of the last several \ndecades. It then will begin to slowly to decline. I think you \nare right to focus on that question because we do need to be \nconcerned about putting upward pressure on our interest rates. \nBut I think if we pursue strong pro-growth economic policies \nand if we exercise responsible fiscal restraint, we will see \nthat path of the debt to GDP ratio coming slowly back down, \nwhich is where it needs to be.\n    We have a disagreement about tax cuts. I think you are \nright to focus exactly there. In putting this chart up, I do \nnot suggest that everybody in America's principal tax burden is \nincome taxes. In fact you are absolutely right, it is not. But \nif the tax cuts that you all enacted are attacked as having \nmade the tax code less progressive, I put this chart up to show \nthat in fact the tax cuts have made the tax code more \nprogressive. That does not mean we should ignore the burden \nthat remains on lower and middle-income people. Those are the \npeople we want to support and why it is especially important I \nthink that this year you all extend the child credit, the \nmarriage benefit relief, and the expansion of the 10 percent \nbracket.\n    But I think the actual picture of the tax cuts is well-\nreflected in this chart. I am comfortable not having undermined \nthe beauty of my namesake's biblical name in that respect.\n    Let me make one other comment, and that is that the tax \ncuts as an explanation for how we got into this deficit picture \nI think are greatly exaggerated. I think the Chairman had it \nexactly right in the early charts he put up. The tax cuts have \nreduced somewhat our revenue in these last few years and will \ncontinue to reduce somewhat our revenue. But by far the reason \nfor the big change in our deficit picture over the last few \nyears has been flagging economic growth. The tax cuts deserve a \nlot of the credit for restoring that economic growth, and the \nAdministration takes a strong view that this would be exactly \nthe wrong time to contemplate raising those taxes back up \nagain."
"nelson","Senator Nelson","nelson","Senator Nelson","    Mr. Chairman, I want to take the liberty of \njust adding another sentence or two. I am just a country boy \nfrom Florida, but I understand basic economics. That if you \nhave a deficit that is created because there is more spending \nthan there is coming in revenue, that if you are going to get \nthat deficit eliminated and instead are going to get it to \nwhere the budget is in balance you either have to cut spending \nor you have to stop tax cuts before they go into effect, and \ntherefore the effect of the revenue is higher, and that brings \nyou more into balance.\n    Now where I think you have miscalculated, I would grant you \nthat the tax cuts and the additional spending that has occurred \nin this past year with regard to the war have generated more \ndollars in the economy and we have seen the economy start to \nrise. Not with the effects of the jobs that we would like to \nsee increased. However, I think at some point there comes the \nmoment of truth. Not bringing that budget into balance and \ninstead, with the huge deficits, more spending than you have \ncoming in in revenue, that the chickens come home to roost by \nthe interest rate suddenly surging upwards, the economy \nconstricting and us starting to go off the economic cliff.\n    That is what I am afraid is going to happen starting early \nnext year, and only compounded, as has been expressed by \nseveral Senators here, by the fact that this monstrosity that \nwe enacted called a prescription drug benefit is now nowhere \nnear the level of $400 billion. Indeed, is only going to go \nhigher over time. You add that to the fact of the $5 billion a \nmonth to take care of the war, which I was one of the ones that \nsupport the war, and obviously now that we are there, despite \nthe fact of the misinformation that we had, we have to be \nsuccessful. You add all of that and the budget deficit is going \nabsolutely out of control. That is where I think, respectfully \nI say to you, with a great biblical name, that I think your \nbudget document is flawed.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Chairman Nickles. Thank you, Senator Nelson.\n    Senator Conrad."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","nelson","Senator Nelson","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you again \nfor holding this hearing. Thanks again to our House colleagues. \nThank you, Director Bolten, for being here.\n    Let me just say in conclusion, I think you are a good and \ndecent person. I think the budget that you have put before us \nis a total fiction. As I look ahead, you just leave out things \nthat are critically important for the American people to know.\n    This is what I think is a closer approximation to the truth \nbecause this includes the long-term effect of the President's \ntax cuts that he advocates, this includes dealing with the \nalternative minimum tax problem which is supposed to be a \nmillionaires' tax that is about to turn into a middle-class tax \nincrease, and this deals with Social Security. When you do that \nand you look ahead what you see is the deficits are not going \ndown. The additions to the debt are going up, up and away. And \nthese are the good times. These are the good times before the \nfull effect of the President's tax cuts take effect and before \nthe full impact of the retirement of the baby boom generation \ntakes effect.\n    So I believe this budget, and frankly your presentation, \nbadly understates how serious the fiscal condition of the \ncountry is. In that way I think it is an enormous disservice to \nthe American people. I am sad to say that but I believe that is \nthe truth.\n    The biggest thing you have left out is you folks after \npromising--in fact we looked at the White House web site and \nthe President has this statement on his web site. ``We are \ngoing to keep the promise of Social Security and keep the \nGovernment from raiding the Social Security surplus.'' It is \ninteresting, it is not prominently displayed on the web site, \nand well it should not be because you are taking every penny of \nSocial Security surplus, not just this year, not just next \nyear, but every year for the next 10 years. Every penny of \nSocial Security surplus, and throwing that into the pot to pay \nfor tax cuts and other things. Those chickens are going to come \nhome to roost because that money has got to be repaid.\n    How is it going to be repaid when the baby boomers start to \nretire, and the full effect of making the tax cuts permanent \ntakes hold? We already have record deficits and the President's \nplan has increased the spending and cut the revenue. He is \nrestraining the growth of spending in a small part of the \nFederal budget, but most of the budget is increasing. The \noverall budget is increasing. The spending is increasing and we \nhave record deficits now and he says, increase the overall \nspending, cut the revenue.\n    It does not add up. We are honest. We know it does not add \nup. It does not come close to adding up. He has got us headed \nfor the fiscal cliff. That is my belief.\n    I thank the Chairman again for his many courtesies, and I \nwould say on the question of tax cuts and Social Security, the \nCenter on Budget and Policy priorities has told us, you take \nthe tax cuts for 75 years and the Social Security shortfall for \n75 years, the tax cuts are three times as big as the Social \nSecurity shortfall over the 75-year period that the analysts \nexamined. So we do need to get serious. Getting serious, I \nbelieve means, no more tax cuts unless they are paid for, and \nget real tough on the spending side as well. Unless we \nacknowledge the reality of our fiscal condition we will do \nneither and that is a huge mistake, because the faster we get \non this problem the less draconian the solutions will have to \nbe.\n    I again thank you, Mr. Director, for being here today.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Conrad, thank you very much.\n    Director Bolten, we do appreciate your appearance before \nthe Committee. I would just make a couple of comments.\n    My very good friend Senator Conrad mentioned the fact, in \nthe budget you are using the Social Security surplus. I alluded \nto the fact I do not think there is a Social Security surplus \nbecause the difference or the surplus is basically used to pay \nfor Medicare. People should note that. I also might note that \nall the Democratic budgets, ones produced by Democratic \nmajorities, also used the Social Security surplus. So a little \nsomething there.\n    The AMT fix that is assumed in some of these charts is \n$500-some billion over 10 years. I certainly think we can fix \nthe tax code and solve a lot of our AMT problems concurrently \nwithout that kind of expenditure. And on the assumption that \nall the tax cuts are all going to be extended permanently, I \nhope that is not the case. Some of the tax cuts were temporary, \ndesigned to stimulate the economy. They will not be extended, \nor at least it is not my intention to extend them.\n    Also, future extensions of tax cuts require an act of this \nor a future Congress. If somebody does not want to extend the \ntax cuts they can vote, they can change. And some of those will \nnot happen for years, may not happen for years. So they have \nample opportunity to be able to make that decision.\n    Of the current tax cuts, the biggest bulk of them do not \nexpire until 2011. I want to underline my belief that certain \nof the tax cuts should be extended: for example, the individual \nmarginal tax rates and 15 percent rate on capital gains and \ndividends. I think if you increase those, as some people are \nadvocating, you are going to send the stock market and the \neconomy down significantly. I also think the same thing on \nindividual rates. I hope you do not take the 25 percent rate \nand make it 28 again. I hope you do not take the 35 percent \nrate and make it 39.6 again. That would be a mistake in my \nopinion. But a future Congress is going to have to deal with \nthose things.\n    And the war cost is not going to be any $87 billion for the \nnext 10 years. Some people are making that assumption. CBO had \nto build that into their baseline. I think that over estimates \nbaseline spending and deficits to the tune of about $1.1 \ntrillion over the next 10 years. I hope it is a whole lot less \nthan that. I hope that the figures are much, much, much, much \nless that. I cannot imagine spending that kind of money in Iraq \nfor the next 10 years.\n    So I just make those editorial comments. I do not think \nthings are quite as bleak as some. I do think the deficits are \nfar too high, and it is very much my intention to work with \nmembers of the Committee and the Administration to more than \nmeet the goal of the Administration to get the deficits in \nhalf, and I believe a lot quicker than in 5 years. That is my \nintention.\n    Director Bolten, thank you very much. I know several of our \nCommittee members requested that you would answer questions for \nthem, most of whom do not have access to their offices and to \ntheir staffs, so I appreciate their cooperation in meeting with \nus in the House. Again, I want to thank our colleagues, \nChairman Nussle and Ranking Member Spratt for their hospitality \nand cooperation with us. They have been a big assistance to us \nand I appreciate that.\n    The Committee is adjourned."

break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Chairman Nickles. Good morning. I want to thank everybody \nfor coming, and particularly, Secretary Thompson, we welcome \nyou before this committee.\n    Everyone, I think, knows Secretary Thompson. Governor \nThompson, who was Governor of the great State of Wisconsin for \n14 years, has now served 3 years at Secretary of HHS, and he \nwill make his budget presentation to us today.\n    I notice that your budget is 41 percent of the entire \nFederal budget. You have enormous responsibilities. I have had \nthe pleasure of working with you both in your previous capacity \nas Governor and as one of the leading Governors on welfare \nreform. I compliment you for that monumental task and, frankly, \nvery good success. Because of your leadership and the \ncooperation of Democrats and Republicans, we passed historic \nwelfare reform. That needs to be reauthorized this year, so we \nmight hear your comments on that.\n    Also, you have been a very active participant in enacting \nthe Medicare changes, which include the prescription drug \nproposal. You were very active throughout the conference. I \nappreciate your leadership on that as well.\n    We have some big challenges, needless to say. With the \nscope of your Department being as broad, as large, as \ncomprehensive, as extensive, and as important as it is, I value \nvery much your leadership.\n    I might tell my colleagues, I mentioned this when Secretary \nThompson was testifying before the Finance Committee, but I had \nthe pleasure of traveling with Secretary Thompson. He led a \nvery large delegation, a very prestigious delegation throughout \nAfrica to not only learn more, but also to assist in the \nworldwide battle on AIDS. And I compliment you for your \nleadership in that global fight.\n    I will recognize my friend and colleague, Senator Conrad."

"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","                OPENING STATEMENT SENATOR CONRAD"
break,break,break,break
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Let me start by talking about the concerns \nI have about where we are headed with Social Security. I have \nsimilar concerns with respect to Medicare, but let me just put \nup something the President said when he was putting out his \n2002 budget. He said that none of the Social Security surplus \nwill be used to fund other spending initiatives or tax relief."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Let's go to the next chart. But that is not what is \nhappening. Despite those words, which were the right words, \ninstead what we see is the President's taking every penny of \nSocial Security surplus to pay for other things, and not just \nfor this year but every year for the next 10 years, $2.4 \ntrillion of Social Security surplus funds. And they are really \nnot surplus. They are surplus for the moment. They are needed \nfor when the baby-boom generation retires. And the President is \ntaking every dime over the next 10 years to pay for other \nthings."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    The President is also telling us, telling the American \npeople that he is going to cut the deficit in half over the \nnext 5 years. I wish that were so. But when I examine the \nPresident's plans, I see the only way he accomplishes cutting \nthe deficit in half is he just leaves out things. He leaves out \nthe fact that he is going to take in that fifth year $259 \nbillion of Social Security money, every penny of which he has \ngot to pay back, but he is not accounting for that when he \nclaims he cuts the deficit in half. He says the deficit will be \n$237 billion in that fifth year. But in addition to that, he is \ntaking $259 billion of Social Security money.\n    He also leaves out the money that he will be taking from \nthe Medicare Trust Fund, $23 billion, also money he has got to \npay back. He leaves out the $55 billion he would need in that \nfifth year to address the alternative minimum tax problem. He \nfunds it in the first year, but the alternative minimum tax \nthat was designed to be a millionaire's tax is turning into a \nmiddle-class tax increase. And 3 million people are affected \nnow. By the end of this budget period, 40 million people will \nbe affected. And yet the President provides no funding."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    In addition, he provides no funding past September 30th for \nthe war effort. The Congressional Budget Office says that in \nthe fifth year the residual war cost is $30 billion. You add up \nall those things, and you don't have a deficit or an addition \nto the debt of $237 billion. You have an addition to the debt \nof over $600 billion, and right before the baby boomers retire.\n    Now, that flows through to this budget as well. And what we \nhave, Mr. Secretary, in the budget that the administration has \nsubmitted for your Department is the magic asterisk, the \nsuggestion that there is going to be expansion of health care \ncoverage, but there is no funding for it. It says from the \nPresident's Analytical Perspectives: ``In the case of the \nPresident's proposed health care credit, the budget includes \ncontingent offsets that would cover the estimated increases in \nmandatory spending that would result from this proposal. When \nthe Congress moves legislation to implement the President's \nhealth care credit, the administration will work with the \nCongress to offset this additional spending.''"
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Now, Mr. Secretary, you were a Governor, a distinguished \nGovernor, one with a very good reputation for being responsible \nfiscally. I doubt very much you ever submitted a budget that \nsays you are going to do something and then says we will \nsomehow come up with the money at the time that we move \nforward. That is not a budget.\n    Let me just put up the next one. So what we have is the \nPresident advocating a $65 billion cost for a refundable health \ncare tax credit, and he offsets it with nothing. It is just \nwords. And so the real amount provided is zero. That is what is \nwrong with this whole budget. It is just filled with things \nwhere they are just left out. And so then the President says he \nis cutting the deficit in half. I am surprised he did not make \nthe claim he is balancing the budget and just leave out some \nmore things."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Let's go to the next one. The thing that really concerns me \nis where we are headed in the long term, because as this chart \nshows, the green parts of these bars are the Social Security \nTrust Fund, the blue is the Medicare Trust Fund, the red is the \ncost of the tax cut proposals by the President. And what we see \nis right now the trust funds are in substantial surplus, and \nthey are offsetting much of the effect of the tax cuts. But as \nwe go forward, when the trust funds turn cash negative, at that \nvery time the tax cuts explode in cost, driving us right over \nthe fiscal cliff."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    And I would conclude with the next chart. This is from the \nPresident's own Analytical Perspectives. This is his long-term \noutlook for the deficit if his tax and spending proposals are \nadopted. And what it shows is we are in the good times now with \nthe trust funds running substantial cash surpluses. But look \nwhat happens when the baby boomers retire and the President's \ntax cuts go fully into effect: deficits that are massive, \nunsustainable, and unprecedented. That cannot be the \ntrajectory."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Let me just conclude by making one other point. I was very \ndisturbed to see this campaign that is being run, some $20 \nmillion of advertising, which is really a propaganda effort. It \nis, I think, clearly a political effort to sell the Medicare \nplan. I voted for that plan, but I think it is totally \ninappropriate for public money to be spent in a propaganda \ncampaign. That is not an educational campaign. I have read the \nwords of the ads. That is not an educational campaign. It is a \npolitical campaign.\n    And I was even more stunned to learn that the firm who is \nconducting it is the same firm that is handling the President's \nre-election account. Now, that just cannot be.\n    If this isn't stopped--and I will ask the Secretary today \nto stop this campaign--I will offer legislation to make it \nillegal for public money to be used in a propaganda campaign \nabout legislation. That is a totally inappropriate use of \ntaxpayer money.\n    With that, Mr. Chairman, thank you.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Conrad, thank you very much.\n    I want to make just a few comments, and then we will turn \nit over to the Secretary.\n    I share many of Senator Conrad's concerns about the long-\nterm sustainability of paying for programs, particularly in \nSocial Security and Medicare. Medicare spending is growing, and \ngrowing substantially, and it is going to grow faster now as a \nresult of the legislation we passed last year.\n    I will also show a couple of charts, but I do have a \ndifference of at least outcome. I am concerned about the long-\nterm health of both, and I might just show a couple of those. \nThat is a chart of Medicare spending. It basically shows that, \nyou know, we were spending, Medicare in 1990, $105 billion, and \ntoday it is $271 billion. So that is 2.7 times as much in a \nperiod of 14 years. If you look at Medicaid, Medicaid spending, \nwe were spending about $40 billion in 1990, and today we are \nspending $180 billion. That is about 4.5 times. An enormous \nincrease in Medicaid.\n    The unfunded liabilities, if you look at the debt held by \nthe public, it is $3.9 trillion; Social Security shortfall--and \nthis is estimated over a 75-year period of time--is $4.9 \ntrillion; and Medicare is $15.8 trillion. So the unfunded \nliabilities that we have projected in Medicare are three times \nas much as they are in Social Security. That is troubling.\n    And, incidentally, for our colleagues, we plan on having a \nhearing where we are really going to get into this in depth. We \nare going to look at the long-term fiscal challenges that we \nface in this country and try and figure out if there are some \nthings that can be done or should be done."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Just a quick chart on the HI trust fund. The Medicaid HI \ntrust fund--the trust funds I think are a little bogus, and I \nmight talk about that. We are going to have one meeting just on \ntrust funds. But it shows that we have big challenges in the \nfuture years. And the Secretary is one of the trustees of that \ntrust fund. So I mention that. Social Security has a chart that \nlooks just like it. But I have a difference of my opinion with \nmy colleague, Senator Conrad, on are we raiding the Social \nSecurity Trust Funds. I might mention that almost every budget, \nincluding the Senator from North Dakota's budget, used Social \nSecurity Trust Fund. But people ignore the fact that we use \nSocial Security Trust Funds to pay--or I will say we use Social \nSecurity Trust Fund to pay Medicare Part B. General revenue \nfunds subsidize Medicare Part B three to one. Three to one. And \nI put together a chart--and I will give this to our colleagues \nso they can see it. All the money coming into Social Security \nand Medicare is paid for by a payroll tax, Senator Byrd, 15.3 \npercent of all payroll. And, actually, on Medicare it is 2.9 \npercent on all payroll. Of the 15.3, 12.4 is Social Security \nand limited to $87,000, in 2003, of income. And then Medicare \nis unlimited, 2.9 percent on all payroll."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    So this chart is busy, and I will give it to my collegues--\nthis is not for people to read. It is complicated, but it shows \nall the money coming in from taxes, including the tax on Social \nSecurity and Medicare, so the receipts coming into the fund and \nthe outlays coming out of the fund to pay Medicare and Social \nSecurity. And, actually, the Government, if you could say it is \nraiding Social Security, it is raiding Social Security to pay \nMedicare Part B premiums. And it will be raiding Social \nSecurity to pay Part B, and to pay the prescription drug \nbenefits. It actually shows that more money is going out for \nthese two programs than coming in. And so we are not raiding \nSocial Security to pay for defense or to pay for non-defense. \nIt is basically used to pay for Medicare.\n    The two combined, if you add all the taxes combined coming \nin--and I will just give you one outlay year for 2004, \nprojected, or maybe I could use 2003 because it would be \nactual, but I will use 2004. Total amount of money coming in is \n$753 billion, and the total amount of money going out is $784 \nbillion, for basically a deficit of $31 billion.\n    So I just make that point. I think there is a lot of \nmisunderstanding on trust funds, and maybe we have a more \nthorough debate. That is not the purpose of the hearing today. \nOur purpose today is to welcome Secretary Thompson since he has \ncontrol or responsibility over 41 percent of the budget and a \nvery significantly growing part of the budget. I believe his \nproposal is for a 5.6-percent increase in his total domain. We \nlook forward to hearing him present the budget to us.\n    I might mention, Senator Byrd, most all of Secretary \nThompson's growth is in entitlement programs. Very little is on \ndiscretionary. Mr. Secretary and Senator Byrd, I would be very \ninterested, since we only appropriate about one-third of the \nbudget, I would be very interested in seeing if some of these \nprograms that are already set on automatic pilot as \nentitlements, maybe they should be considered and scored and \nwritten as discretionary subject to appropriations. I used to \nbe on the Appropriations Committee. I used to be very \nchagrined, feeling that we only had one-third of the budget \nunder real control and the other two-thirds growing almost out \nof control.\n    This committee can work with the Finance Committee to \ncontrol the two-thirds. But a lot of that control has been \ngrowing the programs, not controlling them. Maybe we will take \na little different approach this year in light of the deficit \nchallenges that we have. But there are a lot of programs in \nyour domain, and maybe some of those should be subject to \nappropriation, instead of set up as entitlement.\n    I am happy to consider those, either as part of the budget \nresolution or as changes that we might want to make free-\nstanding, either through budget and/or the appropriations \nprocess. We have members on both committees on this committee, \nand maybe with some cooperation we could make some adjustments.\n    Mr. Secretary, welcome to the committee."

"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","STATEMENT OF HON."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Secretary Thompson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is an honor \nfor me to appear in front of you and, Senator Conrad and the \nother distinguished members of this Budget Committee.\n    First, let me thank you, Senator Nickles, for going to \nAfrica with me. I think it was one of those life-transforming \ntrips. It was for me, and I think for most of the people on the \ntrip, and I appreciate your participation.\n    I thank all of you for inviting me to discuss the \nPresident's fiscal year 2005 budget for the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. In my first 3 years at the \nDepartment, we have made, I believe, tremendous progress in \nimproving the health, the safety, and the independence of the \nAmerican people. We continue to advance in providing health \ncare to seniors and to lower-income Americans and improving the \nwell-being of children and strengthening families and \nprotecting the homeland. We are building a new public health \ninfrastructure to give doctors and hospitals the tools they \nneed to be able to respond to any public health emergency.\n    We have re-energized the fight against AIDS at home and \nabroad. We increased access to quality health care, especially \nfor minorities, the uninsured, and the underinsured. And with \nyour help, 2 months ago President Bush signed the most \ncomprehensive improvements to Medicare since it was created \nnearly four decades ago.\n    To expand on our achievements, the President proposes $580 \nbillion for HHS for fiscal year 2005, an increase of $32 \nbillion, or 6 percent over fiscal year 2004. Our discretionary \nbudget authority is $67 billion, an increase of $819 million, \nor 1.2 percent over fiscal year 2004, but an increase of 26 \npercent since 2001.\n    We look forward to working with this committee and \nGovernors to improve and modernize Medicaid as well as SCHIP \nand by giving State governments flexibility to use consumer-\ndirected services and to coordinate with free-market providers.\n    We propose promoting home and community-based care as an \nalternative to institutionalization for disabled Americans \nthrough the President's New Freedom Initiative which my \nDepartment worked on for several months. I look forward to \nworking on a bipartisan basis to get this important legislation \nintroduced, passed, and signed into law this year.\n    President Bush seeks to build on the success of the 1996 \nwelfare reform law by reauthorizing the successful TANF program \nto help more welfare recipients achieve independence through \nwork and be able to protect children and strengthen families. I \nhope that this Congress will take the next step in welfare \nreform and complete the TANF reauthorization. We can and we \nshould accomplish this critical goal this year.\n    We are also working to protect our most vulnerable \nchildren. The Federal Government will spend nearly $5 billion \nthis year for foster care. We would fund existing adoption \nbonuses as well as the new bonuses that Congress approved last \nyear for older children, with $35 million for 2004 and $32 \nmillion for 2005, and to be able to support our commitment to \nhelping families in crisis and to protecting children from \nabuse and neglect, President Bush has requested full funding, \n$505 million, for the promotion of the Safe and Stable Families \nProgram.\n    Working with Governors, we have made tremendous progress in \nproviding millions of children with needed health coverage. I \nam delighted to announce today that about 5.3 million children \nwho would not have had health coverage were enrolled in the \nState Children's Health Insurance Program at some point during \n2003, a 9-percent increase from 2002. And over the past 3 \nyears, we have approved Medicaid waivers and State plan \namendments to allow the States to expand access to health \ncoverage for more than 2.6 million people and to expand the \nrange of benefits offered to 6.5 million other Americans.\n    And, of course, the new Medicare Modernization Act is a \nsignificant accomplishment for our Department. Adding these \nbenefits and choices and educating seniors about them will be a \nsignificant challenge. You and your fellow lawmakers were right \nto follow the CBO score in making decisions, and when CBO \nscores the budget we submitted last week, it is going to be and \nwe expect and anticipate that their estimate would reflect \ntheir original score of $395 billion, or close to that number.\n    As you know by now, in late December--December 24th, to be \nexact--our actuaries came out with a final score showing they \nbelieve the Medicare bill will cost $534 billion. I thought it \nmight be helpful to break down the differences between the CBO \nprojections and the HHS projections to explain why we differ by \n$139 billion. I have instructed our actuaries to make it a top \npriority to fully examine why their estimates differ from those \nset forth by the Congressional Budget Office and then to begin \nto work to reconcile those differences. That project is just \nbeginning, but here is what we know so far.\n    A hundred billion dollars, all those in blue, are the \ndifference for what we call the Title I or Title D of the \nMedicare Modernization Act, Chapter 1 of the Act. The first one \nis the eligibility. We learned from our actuaries because of \nthe tremendous benefits for low-income Americans, which the \ntotal is about 11 million people--and you have talked about \nthat in the conference committee, Senator Nickles. We believe \nthat more low-income Americans will participate and will use \nthe subsidies to a larger degree than what CBO says, and that \naccounts for $47 billion of difference.\n    The next one is higher participation, totaling $32 billion. \nThis is for those individuals, 100 percent of the universe, all \nthose that are eligible to participate in Part D. CBO believes \nthat because 9 percent of those individuals do not participate \nin Part B, if they don't participate in Part B, more than \nlikely they will not participate in Part D. So that reduces the \nuniverse down to 91 percent. Then they subtracted an additional \n4 percent and saying only 87 percent, according to their \ncalculations, will avail themselves of Part D, the drug \nbenefit. Our actuaries----\n    Chairman Nickles. You estimate what percent will \nparticipate?\n    Secretary Thompson. They believe 87 percent.\n    Chairman Nickles. And you believe?\n    Secretary Thompson. We believe 94. Our universe is 100 \npercent. We believe that 5 percent are still actively employed \nand will be insured by their employers, and our actuaries \nbelieve it will be 94. The difference between 94 and 87 percent \nis a difference of $32 billion.\n    The next one is what we call the Medicaid savings and \nwoodwork effect. We believe that is a difference of $18 \nbillion. We believe that when people come and hear about the \nPart D, they are going to also find out that they are also \neligible for additional Medicaid benefits, and they also will \nbe using more of that, and, therefore, there is a difference of \n$18 billion.\n    The next one is $3 billion. That is in regards to what we \ncall the stabilization fund. CBO does not believe it will be \nutilized, our actuaries do, and that's a difference of $3 \nbillion. That is $100 billion of Part D. The second one is the \nplan. That is Chapter 2 of the Medicare Modernization Act. We \nbelieve that there will be 33 percent of the Medicare eligibles \nthat will participate in the plan, and right now it is 11.8 \npercent. CBO believes that is going to go up to 14 percent, and \nonly 14 percent. That difference is a huge difference, and that \nmakes up $30 billion.\n    The other $7 billion is basically all differences in the \nother ten chapters in the Medicare Modernization due to some \npluses and some minuses, but a total difference of $7 billion. \nThat is the total of the $139 billion.\n    As you know, Mr. Chairman, seniors can begin enrolling in \nthe drug discount card by June of this year. We will add \ntransparency to the prescription drug market by making \navailable the price of drugs under each card. Competition among \nthe cards will drive down drug prices, probably very \nsignificantly, as people compare the prices that each card \noffers for the drugs they typically take. So a senior citizen, \nlet's call her Mrs. Jones, can sit down with all of her \nprescriptions in front of her and call 1-800-Medicare. Our \nrepresentatives will review with Mrs. Jones the discount cards \nin her area and tell her the exact price that she will pay for \nher prescriptions under each card. Mrs. Jones then can choose \nthe card that will give her the best deal for the prescriptions \nthat she is taking. If Mrs. Jones has a computer, she will be \nable to go to our website and get the exact same information.\n    We are also currently reviewing the new benefit proposals \nwhich were submitted by health plans. It appears that more than \nhalf of current enrollees that are currently on the health \nplans will see better benefits and that almost one-half will \nsee reduced premiums or out-of-pocket savings. The average \npremium may decrease by as much as a third. The bottom line is \nthat the extra payments are providing more to beneficiaries, \njust as was intended by the Medicare Modernization Act.\n    We look forward to working with Congress, the medical \ncommunity, and all Americans as we implement the new Medicare \nlaw and carry out the initiatives that President Bush is \nproposing to build a healthier, safer, and stronger America.\n    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n    Chairman Nickles. Secretary Thompson, thank you very much. \nI appreciate your going over the differences between CBO and \nCMS on the cost of that. Some people were aware that there was \na significant difference. Others were not. Some were surprised. \nAnd so I was going to ask you to do that. I appreciate your \ndoing that.\n    Let me ask you a couple of quick questions. You mentioned \nthe drug card is a new benefit, passed under the bill. That is \ngoing to begin in June?\n    Secretary Thompson. That is correct.\n    Chairman Nickles. That is going to be provided for by \nprivate companies; is that correct?\n    Secretary Thompson. That is correct.\n    Chairman Nickles. Is there interest from private companies? \nWhat is this looking like? Is it going to happen?\n    Secretary Thompson. We were absolutely amazed. We thought \nthere would probably be 40 to 50, possibly 60 applications. \nThere are 106 applications. We have them, we are now reviewing \nthem, and we will be making recommendations by March 23rd as to \nwhich ones of those we feel are going to meet the requirements \nset out by the law and also the requirements set out by CMS. \nAnd we will make those known. We will also start putting the \ninformation out so we can start enrolling in April and May, and \nwe will also put on our website a comparison so that \nindividuals across America will be able to really have the most \nup-to-date, accurate information, transparent information, on \nevery drug that is being purchased. And this is going to help a \nsenior pick the right card, and it should drive down the cost \nof drugs for seniors very much.\n    Chairman Nickles. So all seniors will be able to enroll in \nMay and June?\n    Secretary Thompson. That is correct. We want to kick it off \non June 1st.\n    Chairman Nickles. By June 1st, so they would be able to \nenroll April and May?\n    Secretary Thompson. We are going to start enrolling in May.\n    Chairman Nickles. OK. And then----\n    Secretary Thompson. I am trying to push that up, though. We \nare moving very rapidly, and we are hoping to actually get it \nout sooner. But that is what our intention is right now.\n    Chairman Nickles. Then will the various providers determine \nwhat kind of discount they will receive? And will all seniors \nreceive the discount?\n    Secretary Thompson. All the companies will be negotiating \nwith the pharmaceutical companies and will be putting those \ndiscounts out to a formulary, and those formularies will be \nmade available to every senior in America. We will be putting \nit on our website, and our representatives will have the most \nup-to-date information. And you will be able to compare the \ncards in your area. So if you are taking Lipitor, and if you \nhave 15 cards in your area, you will be able to determine which \nindividual issuer of that card is going to give you the best \nprice for Lipitor. And so as with competition, it is going to \ndrive down the market and give the best market to the seniors.\n    Chairman Nickles. And then low-income seniors have--the \ncard also entitles them to a $600 benefit?\n    Secretary Thompson. We are already working on that. We are \nworking with Treasury and Social Security. We are meshing \ntogether the computer systems from Treasury, from the Social \nSecurity Department, and CMS, plus all the States. All those \nindividual States that have individuals on Medicaid, we have to \ntake in and go through all of those computer runs to find out \nwho is eligible. Every senior that is under 135 percent of \npoverty is going to be able to get a credit of $600.\n    Chairman Nickles. OK. Then one final thing. A large part of \nthe difference in the estimates between your Department, CMS \nactuaries, and CBO is the value of the low-income drug benefit, \nwhich I stated unsuccessfully during negotiations, was too \ngenerous. But would you give just a brief description of that? \nAm I correct in saying the low-income benefit, this would be \nfor people with--I want to say 36 percent of Medicare \nbeneficiaries, but people less than 150 percent of poverty, and \nfor those less than 100 percent of poverty, basically their \ncopay is $1 and $3. Is that correct?\n    Secretary Thompson. That is the only out-of-pocket expense \nthey have to pay. The deductible will be waived. The doughnut \nhole is going to be waived and the copays, except for the $1 \nfor generics and $3 for brand prescription drugs. That is all \nthose under 100 percent of poverty will have to pay. We believe \nthat is going to be a subsidy of somewhere in the neighborhood \nof 95 percent to 97 percent of those individuals under 100 \npercent.\n    Those between 100 and 135 percent of poverty, the copay is \nthe only thing they have to pay, and it will be $2 for generic \ndrugs and $5 for brand prescription drugs. They will not have \nto pay a deductible, and they do not have the doughnut hole.\n    The third one is those between 135 percent and 150 percent \nof poverty will have to pay a $50 deductible, and they will pay \napproximately 85 percent of the balance. And that is going to \nbe a subsidy of somewhere around 75 to 80 to 85 percent.\n    Chairman Nickles. I am familiar with what you are saying \nwhen you say there is not a doughnut hole. But basically, for \nan audience----\n    Secretary Thompson. All those under 150 percent of poverty, \nthere is no doughnut hole, no gap between 2,250 and 3,600 \ndollars, where those above 150 percent of poverty will have a \ngap in which they will have to pay 100 percent. All those below \n150 percent of poverty, all that doughnut hole has been filled \nup completely.\n    Chairman Nickles. OK. Still, to get out of Washington \nvernacular and Washington discussion, those below 150 percent \nof poverty--and that would be for a couple--would be, what, \nabout $20,000, $19,000?\n    Secretary Thompson. It is approximately $22,000.\n    Chairman Nickles. Wherever that is, that sounds a little \nhigh. But at that point----\n    Secretary Thompson. That is the last--it would be about \n$14,000, 150 percent of poverty.\n    Chairman Nickles. I think it is pretty close to $19,000, is \nmy guess. I was talking about couples, for two.\n    Secretary Thompson. It is $20,000 for a couple. It will be \n$20,000 for a couple in 2006, Senator.\n    Chairman Nickles. So in the year 2006, for a couple that \nhas less than----\n    Secretary Thompson. When it starts.\n    Chairman Nickles. Oh, that is correct. I was looking at the \n2003 level. I think you are correct. It would be $22,000 by the \nyear 2006 when that is available. So for a couple with less \nincome than that, they are on Medicare, they are on Social \nSecurity, they will basically have a drug program that they \ndon't even have to pay monthly premiums. For the most part, \nthey would be paying their drug copay of maybe $2, $5, or $1 \nand $3. And that is all they pay with no limit.\n    Secretary Thompson. That is correct.\n    Chairman Nickles. No limit.\n    Secretary Thompson. That is correct.\n    Chairman Nickles. Not up just to the first $2,000, not up \njust to the first $5,000, but, frankly, no limit whatsoever. \nAnd that is a very generous benefit. You happen to score it \nhigher than CBO does. I happen to guess that you are going to \nbe more correct. I think utilization will go up substantially \nwhen people realize that is a very, very generous proposal.\n    Secretary Thompson. It is.\n    Chairman Nickles. I am a little concerned maybe it is too \ngenerous, but I did not prevail. I tried but I did not prevail.\n    Senator Conrad."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Mr. Chairman, could we put up this chart \nthat you put up?\n    Chairman Nickles. Yes. Don't take apart my chart."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Well, I have to take apart your chart a \nlittle bit.\n    The chairman put up this chart, and the issue that I take \nwith this chart is what it has done is it has lumped Medicare \nand Social Security together as though they are one program. \nThey are not one program. They are two separate programs.\n    There is no question, if you look at Social Security alone, \nthat Social Security surplus funds every year for the next 10 \nyears are being taken to pay for other things, $2.4 trillion \nworth, something the President pledged not to do. And it is \nbeing done. And nobody here can say whether that money is going \nto pay for Medicare or tax cuts or parks or recreation or any \nother part of the Federal budget.\n    What we do know absolutely is every penny of Social \nSecurity Trust Fund surplus--and I want to make sure that \npeople understand. When I use the word ``surplus,'' it is not \nbecause it is more money than you need. It is more money than \nyou need right now. But it is money we are going to need when \nthe baby boomers retire, and they are going to start retiring \nin 2008. And this is right at the heart of what is wrong with \nthe President's budget in my judgment.\n    The fact is Medicare has been funded in part by payroll \ntaxes. This chart assumes it is all payroll taxes. Medicare has \nalso been funded in part by general fund. That has been the way \nMedicare has been funded since its inception.\n    So I do not want to leave the impression that somehow \nSocial Security money is being taken just to pay for Medicare. \nNobody can tell you what the Social Security money is being \nused for, except we know it is not being used for paying down \nthe debt or prepaying the liability. I think those would have \nbeen appropriate uses.\n    With respect to budgets that I have submitted, after the \nhole that has been dug, there is no way in the short term to \nwrite a budget that does not continue this practice. But I have \nsubmitted budgets that would use at least $1.2 trillion less of \nSocial Security funds for other purposes, and as much as $1.6 \ntrillion left, depending on our defense needs.\n    So I do not want to leave the impression that Social \nSecurity money is not being taken for other purposes. It is, \nand it is going to be taken to the tune of $2.4 trillion. I \nthink that is a profound mistake.\n    Mr. Secretary, I want to turn to this ad campaign because, \nI must say, I find it very troubling. I supported that bill. I \nthought it was the right thing to do. But I do not think it is \nthe right thing to do to run an ad campaign extolling its \nvirtues using taxpayer money to run, in effect, a political \ncampaign. And I was especially disturbed to find out that the \nfirm that has been hired is also doing work for the President's \nre-election campaign.\n    You know, I do not think taxpayer money should be used to \npromote a political agenda. I do not think taxpayer money ought \nto be used to, in essence, propagandize taxpayers about the \nmerits of a program. I mean, I could not use and would not use \nmy Senate budget to go out and run a campaign telling people \nabout how good my voting record is. That would be illegal. And \nI believe it should be illegal for taxpayer funds to be used to \nsell a position on an issue. I just think that is totally \ninappropriate. I suspect it is illegal.\n    And I want to ask the Secretary: Do you intend to continue \nwith this campaign? Or would you consider ending this campaign \nin respect to those who believe it is just inappropriate?\n    Secretary Thompson. Senator, let me correct some \nimpressions that I think are erroneous.\n    First off, the Medicare bill requires me to do certain \nthings. The conferees expect--and this is direct language out \nof the report. The conferees expect, in carrying out the annual \ndissemination of information requirements, that the Secretary \nwill conduct a significant public information campaign to \neducate beneficiaries about the new Medicare drug benefit to \nensure the broad dissemination of accurate and timely \ninformation.\n    Second, we put out an RFP in 2003 in order to find out--in \n2003, in order to find the best person and the best group to do \nour ad programs for Medicare, in 2003, 2004, and that is what \nwe did."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Who is doing the ads?\n    Secretary Thompson. Ketchum Public Relations, since 2003, \nis still doing them. The chief executive of Ketchum Public \nRelations is Chuck Dolan, who is part of the team. They are the \noverall contractor, and Mr. Chuck Dolan is a financial \nsupporter of John Kerry and is one of his biggest supporters. \nJohn Kerry. He is the chief--that is the chief person. They put \ntogether the subcontractors. The subcontractors are Campbell \nEwald. They did the creative work. They are out of Detroit. \nThey have done all of our ads since 2001. And Ketchum Public \nRelations, who won the RFP in 2003, kept them on. They do the \ncreative work. National Media, which is the one you are talking \nabout, are the subcontractors. They have been purchasing for \nCMS since 2001. Ketchum Public Relations kept National Media \nbecause they worked together."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Is National Media doing the President's \ncampaign or part of the President's campaign?\n    Secretary Thompson. I understand that they are, but they \nhave been doing work at CMS since 2001, and they were retained \nby Ketchum Public Relations, who won the contract, and I am \ntelling you that. And then they----"
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    But do you know how bad that looks, \nhonestly? I mean, I am being very direct with you. I have great \nrespect for you. I tell you, that really looks bad. And I think \nit more than looks bad. I think it is bad for a campaign to be \nrun with taxpayer money to promote a program that has enormous \npolitical implications and to use as a major part of that \ncampaign a firm that is helping to run the President's re-\nelection campaign.\n    Secretary Thompson. If I could just finish. National Media \nis not doing the creative work. All they are doing is \npurchasing it. And they were hired by Ketchum Public Relations, \nand one of the chief individuals happens to be Chuck Dolan, who \nis a Democrat who is supporting John Kerry."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Well, I am for taking the money away from \nboth of them. I tell you----\n    Secretary Thompson. Some Republicans are saying that, you \nknow, we are wrong for having Chuck Dolan do it, I am sure. \nBut----"
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Well, let me join them. I think you are \nwrong doing it at all. I think we ought to stop this. I think \nwe ought to stop using public money, taxpayer money, to run \nwhat has all the earmarks of a political campaign. I have read \nthe--and I have it here, the TV ad script. I must say, I saw \nthis TV ad. I never knew about this campaign until I saw the \ntelevision ad. And it reads like a political ad. It is just \ninappropriate to use public money to do that. And if you guys \nare not going to stop it, then I am going to introduce \nlegislation to make it illegal to do it, because it is not \nright. It would not be right if a Democratic administration \nwere doing it, and it is not right with this administration \ndoing it.\n    Secretary Thompson. Senator, I would like to be able to \nrespond. I do not want to argue with you. I understand your \nconcerns. I am telling you, the law requires me to put out \ninformation. In 1996----"
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Well, wait a minute. The law does not \nrequire to run----\n    Secretary Thompson. Well, let me finish----"
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    No, let me just say, the law does not \nrequire to run television spots that read like political spots. \nNow, the law does not require that.\n    Secretary Thompson. In 1996, the Democrat administration \nput out a 30-page bulletin----"
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Did they run television ads that are \ntelevision spots?\n    Secretary Thompson. They did not, but they----"
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    I tell you, I do not argue with putting out \nwritten material like that. That is fine. This has all the \nearmarks of a political campaign, and it is not right.\n    Secretary Thompson. Well, GAO, as I understand it, is going \nto review it, and if they say that it is political, it will be \npulled immediately. Maybe for the GAO----"
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    I would not wait for somebody else to tell \nme it is political. I can see it is political----\n    Secretary Thompson. I do not think it is political."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Well, I do, and I tell you something----\n    Secretary Thompson. That is a difference of opinion, \nSenator.\nI have been in a lot of political campaigns, as have you----\n    Secretary Thompson. And so have I."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    This reads like a political spot.\n    Secretary Thompson. Well, I am sorry to tell you, I do not \nbelieve it is political at all, and that is a difference of \nopinion. I did not put it out. Creative people did on a \ncontract basis. It was reviewed by a lot of different people. \nThey came back, and we are obligated, I think, under the law to \ndo as much information as possible."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Well----\n    Secretary Thompson. And I am sorry that you feel that it is \npolitical. I do not believe it is."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    I not only----\n    Secretary Thompson. And I do not believe that Chuck Dolan \nwould put out a political statement when he is in charge of the \nresponsibility of putting out the ad."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Well, he is under contract to do something.\n    Look, there is nothing in the law that requires you to run \nwhat are, in effect--look just like a political spot to me and \nhave hired, whether it is a subcontractor or the contractor, \npeople who are helping run the President's campaign.\n    Now, goodness, if that does not smack of inappropriate use \nof taxpayer money, I do not know what would.\n    Secretary Thompson. I am absolutely sorry that you feel \nthat way. This was a contract that was put out in 2003, a long \ntime before the election ever started, the one that----"
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Well, but it is for the election period. We \nare in an election period right now, and these ads are running \nnow, and these ads are equivalent to political ads in my \njudgment. And now it goes even further. The people who are \nhelping do it are involved in the re-election campaign of the \nPresident. That is wrong. It is inappropriate and it ought to \nstop. And I am going to offer legislation to make it illegal to \ndo so under whatever administration. I tell you, it would be \nwrong if a Democratic administration were doing it. It is wrong \nfor this administration to be doing it.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Conrad, thank you very much. The \nstatute, just looking at it, doesn't say whether it should be \nTV or not. It just says, ``The Secretary shall provide for \nactivities under this subsection to broadly disseminate \ninformation to discount card eligible individuals and \nprospective individuals regarding enrollment.''\n    I mention, one of the reasons why my opening comments on \nthe card and the low-income benefit, one, because a lot of \npeople are not aware of the fact this card is a benefit that is \ncoming in a couple months. And so I want to get that \ninformation out. I was using the hearing to do it.\n    But this is a benefit that is going to be available to 40 \nmillion Americans, and a lot of them are not aware of it. And \nso we have to get it out. This did not say what method, and \nobviously you are certainly entitled to your opinion. You are \nentitled to your right to offer amendments.\n    Next we have Senator Enzi.\n    Senator Enzi. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for having this \nhearing and, Mr. Secretary, for coming. I have had my curiosity \npiqued a little bit. Are you just using television for the ads \nor are the other media being used as well?\n    Secretary Thompson. We are sending out a mailer. We are \nputting out other information. We are putting it out in other \nlanguages so that we get to other communities that do not have \nEnglish as the first language. And we have set up programs with \nthe Aging Commission called SHIPs, and we are doubling the \nnumber of individuals in SHIPs, which two-thirds of those come \nfrom the Commission on Aging, which are going out and helping \nindividuals in their own homes or in senior centers to pick the \nbest card.\n    We are forming an organization with 28 different \nassociations that have been over to meet with me that are going \nto be using their organizational strength, including AARP who \nwas one of those, to get the information out to seniors all \nacross America. So we are hitting this with a whole plethora of \ndifferent groups, different ways to contact seniors to tell \nthem about the Medicare changes as well as the new drug card \nthat is coming.\n    Senator Enzi. So I anticipate then that the expenditures \nare approximately in proportion to where people get their \ninformation, and probably a large amount of seniors get theirs \nfrom television.\n    Secretary Thompson. That is true, and actually we are \nspending more on mailers than we are on television.\n    Senator Enzi. Thank you. I appreciate the job that is being \ndone on that. I think that it is important for seniors to get \ninformation about what this program is. I know that there are a \nlot of misconceptions out there; probably many of them came \nfrom our debate.\n    Secretary Thompson. That is true.\n    Senator Enzi. And the debates where we argue about the 20 \npercent that we are never going to agree on, and there is some \nconfusion out there, so I appreciate your taking some efforts \non that.\n    Along those lines, I guess, on the new Medicare \nprescription drug law, there is $1 billion for spending to \nstartup the administrative costs. And I was kind of curious. I \nassume--we have already talked a little bit about how those are \nbeing spent, what those are being spent for, but I am just as \ncurious as to why that has been decided to be counted as \ndiscretionary spending instead of mandatory spending.\n    Secretary Thompson. It always has been the tradition that \nadministrative costs have been on the discretionary side of the \nbudget. The $1 billion is--we had requested more because we \nbelieve this is going to be a huge, monumental thing.\n    Our computers systems, I just would like to point this out. \nSome of our software is older than the technicians that are \nhired to maintain it. We have software that is running some of \nthe Medicare program that is over 30 years old, and from your \nvast experience before you became a Senator, you know how \ndifficult it is to run a large company--and this is the largest \ninsurance company in the world, 42 million subscribers--with \n30-year-old software.\n    So we have to upgrade our computers. We also have to \ncollaborate with the computers with Treasury, with the State \nMedicaid programs, and with Social Security in order to find \nout the low-income recipients.\n    We are also taking over the Medicaid program as far as \ndrugs are concerned. It is a huge undertaking. And so we also \nhave to get people, contractors and vendors, involved. And it \nis going to be a tremendous undertaking by the Department in \norder to implement all the provisions of the bill and make sure \nthat it is up and running on January 1, 2006, for the drug \nportion. But before that, in 2005, we have to set up the \nprograms for the free induction physical for those people that \nare coming in, which I think is maybe the most important part \nof the Medicare bill, as far as prevention is concerned and \nmanaging diseases. And then we have to have the card up and \nrunning by June 1st of this year.\n    A huge undertaking from my Department, and that is where \nthe bulk of the $1 billion is going to go, for staffing, for \ncomputers, for contracting out, for getting all the computers \nto run successfully and be able to intermingle and have \ninteroperability.\n    Senator Enzi. I appreciate that. Could you provide me with \na breakdown of----\n    Secretary Thompson. Absolutely. But we have not----\nadditional needs that you mentioned?\n    Secretary Thompson. Thank you very much. The computer \nsystem is really--when I came in, we had over 200 different \ncomputer systems in the Department. And now we are trying to \nget it down to one computer system.\n    Senator Enzi. I appreciate that. It sounds like you are \ndoing some good management there.\n    Now, one other, what I hope will be a quick question. In \nrural places like Wyoming, the choices in health service \nproviders are limited. On Indian reservations, the health \nservice selection is even more limited, and they have to \ncontract off the reservation sometimes in order to have, \nparticularly for emergency purposes, health care for those on \nthe reservation. And despite this common use of contract health \nservices at both hospitals, IHS does not always adequately or \nevenly supply doctors in those areas. So it is my understanding \nthe problem is both fiscal and administrative.\n    I am pleased that the HHS budget begins to address this \nfiscal problem, increasing the contract health services by $18 \nmillion. But I am wondering whether or not IHS plans to review \nthe management policies of doctors to ensure that the Native \nAmericans have equal access to quality care hospitals serving \nlarge populations.\n    Secretary Thompson. We are reviewing all of the Indian \nHealth Service programs and projects, and one of the biggest \nproblems we have is being able to get enough medical personnel \nto be able to go to areas that are hard to get individuals to \ngo into. Indian reservations in some areas of the country have \na real serious problem of getting the proper medical people \nthere, and we are expanding the National Health Service Corps \nso that we can get more people, use the service portion and get \nmore doctors and nurses to go to Indian reservations \nthroughout.\n    This is a high priority of the Indian Health Service, and \nespecially a high priority of mine because I travel to a lot of \nIndian reservations, see the tremendous need. I go every year \nto Alaska and tour the Alaskan settlements up there, and I know \nthe tremendous problem we have of getting proper medical \ntreatment but, more importantly, proper medical personnel to \nthese underserved area.\n    Senator Enzi. Thank you very much. My time is up.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Enzi, thank you very much.\n    Senator Wyden."
"wyden","Senator Wyden","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Mr. Chairman, just a clarification. These \nare 10-minute rounds?\n    Chairman Nickles. I have asked people to try and limit it \nto 5 or 6 minutes, 7 minutes, but I have not been strict in \nenforcement."
"wyden","Senator Wyden","wyden","Senator Wyden","    OK. Mr. Secretary, Senator Snowe and I have \nintroduced the first bipartisan effort to try to address some \nof the concerns in the prescription drug bill. Our legislation, \nfor example, does exactly what AARP has called for. You just \ninvoked them. The Snowe-Wyden legislation makes sure that the \nDepartment has adequate authority to negotiate to try to get \nthe best deal on prices for seniors, and addresses the \nreimportation issue.\n    I am not going to ask you to address the merits of this \nbill and to announce your position on it, but I would like your \nviews on one key point. Given the fact that we have these two \nprojections out there with respect to the cost of the bill, the \nCBO appraisal and your actuaries' appraisal, wouldn't it make \nsense to try to work immediately to get the maximum amount of \ncost containment that we can so as to not hit that $530 \nbillion-plus level or possibly exceed it? In other words, I \nthink there was a good case for the Snowe-Wyden bill a month \nago, but I think there is an even better case today. So I would \nlike your views on the question of: Wouldn't it make sense to \nwork right now to try to push additional cost containment so as \nto not hit that $534 billion spending level?\n    Secretary Thompson. Without a doubt. I think every one of \nus, Democrats, Independents, Republicans, have to take a look \nat how we are going to be able to contain the expenditures. I \nwas very impressed by both Senator Conrad's and Senator \nNickles' charts. I happen to be a trustee of both Social \nSecurity and Medicare. I am very concerned about that, and I \nwill work with you and Senator Snowe.\n    I also know that your proposal has something to do with \ndiscrimination in regards to pricing. I think this is something \nthat we should look at, and I will be more than happy to work \nwith you, as I have on many different occasions, Senator Wyden, \nin any way I possibly can to further the cost containments.\n    I appreciate your offer, and I will reciprocate whatever \nway possible that I can make it work."
"wyden","Senator Wyden","wyden","Senator Wyden","    Well, that is very constructive, Mr. \nSecretary. I did not want to get you into the specific \nprovisions of the bill, but to know that you are on record as \nbeing interested in trying to get additional cost containment \nso we do not hit that $534 billion level is helpful.\n    I would also like, just with respect to the policy aspects \nof it, for you to state your current position on the \nreimportation of medicines that are safe. As you know, there is \nconsiderable debate with respect to where FDA is on this now. I \nwill tell you, as somebody who has tried to specialize in \nhealth over the years, I am very troubled by the evidence that \nindicates that FDA cannot find cases indicating problems with \nhealth and safety consequences with respect to reimportation, \nand at the same time we have thousands of cases out there of \npeople who have suffered as a result of adverse reactions on \nmedicines.\n    So could you tell us your current views with respect to \nreimportation? It is part of our legislation, but I am more \ninterested in your policy position on it as of today?\n    Secretary Thompson. The law requires me to certify that the \ndrugs coming in from another country are safe. This is a hurdle \nthat I cannot meet because I cannot certify that they are safe, \nbecause by immediately certifying that drugs from other places \nthat are not supervised or regulated by FDA are safe puts the \nFederal Government in complete financial responsibility for \nliability if they are not safe.\n    We had two actions that were taken by FDA, Senator Wyden. \nThe first was in Miami and New York between July 29th and 31st \nin 2003, and in San Francisco and Carson, California, from \nAugust 5th to the 7th. During those 3-days, approximately 100 \nparcels per day that were suspected of containing drugs were \npulled, and out of those, about 85 percent were found to be \nmislabeled, were counterfeit, and had other safety problems.\n    The second action was conducted in the same manner as the \nfirst in November in Buffalo, Dallas, Chicago, and Seattle. The \nfirst one had 1,153 imported products to examine; 1,019, or 88 \npercent, were unapproved prescription drugs. The remain 12 \npercent represented dietary supplements and other products. The \ndrugs were from the following countries: Canada, India, \nThailand, Philippines, and the remaining from other countries.\n    On the second stop, out of the 1,982 parcels, 1,728, or 85 \npercent, of unapproved drugs were found. So both of them were \nin the high 80's. Both actions were taken with interdiction of \ndrugs coming in which were mislabeled. That doesn't mean that \nthey were wrong. They were just mislabeled, mispackaged. \nSeveral were counterfeit. And, therefore, based upon that \ninformation, I cannot certify that drugs coming into America \nare safe."
"wyden","Senator Wyden","wyden","Senator Wyden","    I just hope you will stay at this question, \nMr. Secretary, because I have been in a number of hearings \nwhere the FDA literally cannot give any cases that document \ninjury, and you juxtapose that by the thousands and thousands \nthat have been injured that have been documented. I hope that \nyou will stay at it.\n    A couple of other areas I do want to get into. As you and I \nhave talked about before, the country is headed for a \ndemographic tsunami. We have millions of baby boomers retiring, \nand the health care system is completely unprepared for this.\n    Secretary Thompson. It is."
"wyden","Senator Wyden","wyden","Senator Wyden","    We are completely unprepared for what is \ncoming in 2010 and 2011. Senator Hatch and I have been able to \nwin passage of the Health Care That Works for All Americans \nAct, legislation that would give us a chance to have a plan to \nget those people covered, to get everybody under the tent for \nthe basic affordable health care services, and to do it in a \nresponsible way, building on the kinds of things that we have \ndone in Oregon and that Wisconsin and other States have done.\n    What is your position on that? Obviously, we are going to \nbe trying to get the appropriation this year. Senator Byrd has \nbeen enormously helpful on this, and I am so glad that he is \nhere. I would like to just have you state for the record your \nassessment of this bill that Senator Hatch and I have written \nthat has been passed.\n    Secretary Thompson. My reaction is that anything we can do \nto move health policy and health insurance to forefront and get \nmore people involved is a net plus. Your commission idea is a \npositive one. It is going to allow for a commission. The only \nquestion I had is all of the commissioners have to become \nemployees of the Senate, and I am one of those that are \ndesignated. And it is going to be funded by the Senate \nAppropriations. I don't know. So I think there has got to be \nsome interpretations done in order for me to qualify to be on \nthe commission.\n    I think it is a giant step forward. I think that there are \nother ways that we can approach it. But anything we can do to \nget more people involved in talking about how we solve the \nhealth insurance problems in America, I am all for it."
"wyden","Senator Wyden","wyden","Senator Wyden","    We will work with you on that. It is a per \ndiem arrangement, Mr. Secretary, and, of course, we very much \nwant your involvement in it. It just seems to me that we have \ntried the same thing now, literally going back to Harry Truman \nin 1941, in terms of trying to get everybody covered. You write \nthese bills in Washington, D.C. The American people find them \nincomprehensible. The interest groups attack it, and it all \nfalls apart. What Senator Hatch and I have done is essentially \nsay let's go 180 degrees the other way. Let's get the American \npeople involved early on in terms of some of the difficult \nkinds of choices and then force congressional action.\n    So we will work with you to make sure that it is clear on \nthat point that you appropriately raise, that this is per diem \nfor these kind of people, and it is not all----\n    Secretary Thompson. The idea, the concept is great. I think \njust the mechanics have to be worked out a little bit."
"wyden","Senator Wyden","wyden","Senator Wyden","    I appreciate that. One last question, if I \nmight, Mr. Secretary. As you know, Senator Smith and I have \nbeen very concerned about Oregon's TANF waiver, the Temporary \nAssistance to Needy Families, and we have a situation where \nStates like ours are performing particularly well, and you \nhave--and we have talked about it--often been a champion of \nthis question of making sure that the States have the \nflexibility so that what you do in Oregon is not necessarily \nwhat you do in Tallahassee or what you do in the Bronx. And we \nwould just like to--and I ask this on behalf of Senator Smith \nand myself, because we have both been very interested in it, \nwhat you can do to help us nail down that waiver and get the \nOregon program protected.\n    Secretary Thompson. Let me respond, because we have worked \nvery closely with Oregon, as you know. When the TANF bill \nexpired, it took away my authority to grant any waivers in this \narea whatsoever. So my waiver authority expired with the \ntermination of the TANF law. So I have no authority to do that.\n    Second, we have examined--we have worked with Oregon, in \nfact, I think we worked with them this past week.\n    Third, we have examined Oregon's law. We think you have a \ngood law. We want it to continue. We want it to have as much \nflexibility as possible. We are under the impression, in \nlooking at it through our professionals, Senator Wyden, that \nOregon has nothing to fear whatsoever, that Oregon's all-family \nparticipation rate, if the finance bill was passed, would be \nover 60 percent and would qualify, more than quality for all of \nthe requirements under it, and TANF in Oregon, Oregon-style, \nwould be able to continue, with or without the waiver."
"wyden","Senator Wyden","wyden","Senator Wyden","    We will work with you on that, Mr. \nSecretary, and you will also be getting an effort from the \nState to deal with the Oregon Health Plan. As you know, because \nof our difficult economy, we are trying to figure out how to \nmake the best use of those resources, and given the State \nbudget situation, they are going to have to turn this around in \nsort of land-speed record time. And if Senator Smith and I \ncould work with you on both the TANF waiver and the Oregon \nHealth Plan----\n    Secretary Thompson. The door is always open for you, \nSenator Wyden."
"wyden","Senator Wyden","wyden","Senator Wyden","    Next time we have a chance to visit and I \nhave given you more time to prepare, we will talk more about \nthe specifics of the Snowe-Wyden legislation on prescription \ndrugs.\n    Secretary Thompson. Thank you."
"wyden","Senator Wyden","wyden","Senator Wyden","    But both of the principles embodied in \nthis--and we are two, as you know, who voted for the \nlegislation--would allow you to keep in place the basic \nconfiguration of the legislation. Both policies have been \nendorsed by AARP. I am hopeful that we can win additional \nsupport for it in the administration, and given these \nprojections that you lay out--we are going to need every cost \ncontainment tool that we can use. As of now, the fact is the \nMedicare program faces a statutory bar to going to bat for the \nbeneficiaries that the Federal Employee Plan doesn't face when \nyou are going to bat for Members of Congress. Just having come \noff the town hall meeting circuit at home, that just doesn't \npass the smell test. And I want to work with you on that.\n    Secretary Thompson. Thank you."
"wyden","Senator Wyden","wyden","Senator Wyden","    Thank you for your cooperation.\n    Secretary Thompson. Thank you very much, Senator Wyden.\non, just a few minutes left, so I am going to have to leave \nmomentarily. We are trying to make it so that Senator Nickles \ncan be back in time so the hearing can continue.\n    Secretary Thompson. Good."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","wyden","Senator Wyden","    Let me just go back to what I was asking \nyou about before. I have now been told that some 70 members of \nthe House and Senate have written to you to ask that you \nsuspend this Medicare campaign until the GAO determines whether \nor not it is an illegal use of taxpayer money. Would you be \nwilling to suspend the campaign until GAO determines whether it \nis illegal?\n    Secretary Thompson. I will consider it, but I am not going \nto make a commitment at this point in time. I just heard about \nthe individuals that have written to me. I would like to see \nwhat they have to say. I know your concerns. I differ with you, \nSenator Conrad, but as you know, I try to be bipartisan, I try \nto reach across. I will take your complaints, and I will go \nback to the office and review it again, and I will get back to \nyou with a definite answer."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    I would appreciate that. And I say to you, \nI think it would be wrong if the other party were doing it. If \nmy party were doing it, I think it would be wrong. I just think \nit is wrong. I think this way lies a lot of grief if we start \ngoing down this trail.\n    Let me turn to another issue, and that is in CBO's letter \nto us, Chairman Nickles and the Committee, with respect to the \ndifferences in the estimates, one of the major differences, $32 \nbillion, is that CMS assumes higher participation in Medicare \nAdvantage, 32 percent versus 9 percent in the CBO estimate in \nlow density, low cost areas where payments to these plans would \nbe much higher than the cost of traditional Medicare. The whole \nidea of Medicare Advantage is that it is going to save money. \nHow can it be that your actuaries are telling us that these \nplans cost more than traditional Medicare?\n    Secretary Thompson. Because our actuaries and the proposal \nthat we had advanced limited, Senator Conrad, the bids to the \nlowest three bidders."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Say that again for me. You would have?\n    Secretary Thompson. We requested that the Medicare \nAdvantage, the bidders, would be limited to the three lowest \nbids."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    OK.\n    Secretary Thompson. The conferees said no, and they said if \nwe are going to go this way, it has to be expanded to anybody \nthat wants to bid. By having the three lowest bids, you would \nforce the marketplace to come in with the lowest bids. Our \nactuaries at that time projected they would be at 98 percent, \nbut if you took----"
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    98 percent?\n    Secretary Thompson. Of fee for service."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    So the cost of Medicare Advantage would be \n98 percent of traditional fee for service?\n    Secretary Thompson. That is correct."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    OK.\n    Secretary Thompson. But when they took off the cap, our \nactuaries projected that that would go to 105 percent as an \naverage."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    And the reason for that is, because, \nfrankly, I think given the fact we have now had this dramatic \nchange in the estimate from $400 billion of cost to $530 \nbillion in just a few months, that we have to go back in and \nfigure out how we can save some money here. Maybe this is one \nplace we could save some money.\n    You had taken the position before that we ought to restrict \naccess to the three lowest bidders. Is that the basic concept?\n    Secretary Thompson. That is correct."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Does the lowest bidder always win or not?\n    Secretary Thompson. The three lowest bidders would always \nwin."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Under that scenario the three lowest \nbidders would win. And under this scenario somebody that is not \namong the three lowest bidders could win?\n    Secretary Thompson. Everybody will be eligible, anybody \nthat bids."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Anybody that bids can be in even if they \nare much higher than the three lowest bidders?\n    Secretary Thompson. That is correct, and that is why our \nactuaries say if anybody can be in, there is no reason to \nsharpen your pencil and be below."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    That is really--why did they do that?\n    Secretary Thompson. Well, that was an argument we made in \nthe--I made the argument, so I lost, I lost----"
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Can you tell us what the argument was on \nthe other side for doing it the other way? I find it hard to \nunderstand what their rationale was.\n    Secretary Thompson. Senator Nickles I think was the only \nperson in that conference----"
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    That agreed with you.\n    Secretary Thompson. That agreed with me."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Do you think we should at least reopen the \nbill for the purpose of revisiting at least that item? Frankly, \nI think we have to revisit other items too. We went from $400 \nbillion to $530 billion in 3 months.\n    Secretary Thompson. We want to get the bill up and running. \nWe are fearful that opening it up is just going to delay the \nimplementation of it. I understand your arguments, and I think \nthey are sound, Senator Conrad. The argument on the other side, \nyou asked what it was. They said that this is a competitive \nmodel. Let us allow competition to work. So let us let anybody \nthat wants to bid, bid."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    But your actuaries say by not restricting \nit to the lowest bidders, just saying open sesame, everybody \ncan participate, the marketplace will give us higher cost than \ntraditional Medicare. That makes absolutely no sense.\n    Secretary Thompson. That is not the motive to keep the \nprices down."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Certainly. Let me ask you on another issue \nif I can. This $65 billion that is in the President's budget, I \nknow you were Governor of a State for a long time, Governor of \nWisconsin. You had a very distinguished record there. You led \nreform of welfare. You were more fiscally responsible as a \nGovernor. You are close to being a neighbor, so I have followed \nwhat you did there. I find it very troubling that the \nPresident's budget says we are going to have $65 billion for \nhealth care credit, but then provides no money for it. I do not \nthink you budgeted that way when you were Governor.\n    Secretary Thompson. There are a lot of things, Senator, \nthat I have found different in the Federal budgeting process \nthan what we were able to do. I still find it somewhat hard to \nbelieve that you do not have amortization accounts, you do not \nhave capital accounts."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    I will tell you, you know I come from a \nfinancial background, and I must say, when I first came here, \nand to this day, the way the Federal Government accounts for \nthings makes no earthly sense, and I think it fundamentally \nmisleads people.\n    Secretary Thompson. It does."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    And I think it even misleads our \ncolleagues. That is why I think the Social Security reference I \nwas making earlier is so important. We talk about surplus. \nThere are no surpluses. We need that money when the baby-\nboomers retire. I think the misuse of language confuses people.\n    I am going to go vote.\nvery much for chairing. They are holding the vote for you, and \nI am sure they will.\n    Senator Murray."
"murray","Senator Murray","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.\n    And thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here today to talk \nabout the HHS budget for this year. You oversee an agency that \nimpacts all of us, and I know it has a tremendous impact on a \nlot of people across this country, so I appreciate the job you \ndo.\n    I am concerned about a number of issues in the budget, some \nof the proposed cuts in CDC and the Community Access Program, \nwhich I think is really critical. I am concerned about the FDA, \nparticularly in light of the mad cow disease that surfaced in \nmy home State, and I want to ask you about that, and a number \nof things.\n    But before I do that, I do want to ask you, since you are \nhere today, about a story that is out today that I find \nextremely troubling, and that is the announced efforts by \nAttorney General Ashcroft and the Department of Justice to \nsubpoena private medical records of doctors and hospitals who \nare currently challenging the Federal Partial Birth Abortion \nBan. It is reported in the New York Times today and a number of \noutlets that the Department of Justice is demanding that at \nleast six hospitals in New York City, Philadelphia and \nelsewhere turn over hundreds of patient medical records on \ncertain abortions that are performed there, and it does not \nappear that the Department of Justice has made any distinction \nbetween different procedures. They are simply demanding private \nmedical records of women who have no idea that their identities \nwould be turned over to Attorney General Ashcroft.\n    Mr. Secretary, I find this kind of intimidation very, very \ntroubling, and I also believe that it is a clear violation of \nthe intent of HIPAA, which you oversee in your division. I know \nthere are some exceptions in HIPAA, but clearly, releasing \nprivate medical information to the Department of Justice about \nany reproductive health procedure just is not acceptable.\n    Has the Department of Justice asked for any opinion of your \noffice since HHS was the lead agency on implementing and \nenforcing HIPAA standards, on this action?\n    Secretary Thompson. To the best of my knowledge, no. I was \nnot contacted. This is the first time I have heard about it, \nSenator Murray."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    I find that troubling as well since it is \nyour office that oversees the Health Information Privacy Act.\n    Secretary Thompson. That is correct."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    It would seem to me that it would be \nextremely important that they get an opinion from you. Since \nthey have not, then I would ask you to give this Committee an \nopinion, and simply ask you the question: are women who seek \nabortions or reproductive health care denied protections under \nHIPAA, and can doctors be compelled to release this kind of \ninformation at the request of the administration?\n    Secretary Thompson. Why don't you send me these questions \nand I will get back to you. The Department of Justice could \nhave contacted our General Counsel or could have contacted some \nof our legal staff. I do not know, but this is the first time \nthis issue has come to my attention, Senator."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    I will give that to you in writing, but I \nthink it is extremely critical that we get an answer from your \nagency as quickly as possible since you do oversee HIPAA. I, \nlike many women, are very, very troubled that someone can go to \na doctor and completely, unbeknownst to them, have their \nrecords subpoenaed by the Department of Justice over an action \nthey have nothing to do with, and clearly, prying through \nmedical records or second guessing doctors' advice to their \npatients is the kind of Government intrusion that many \nAmericans are very, very troubled by. Since you oversee HIPAA, \nI would really request that you do it and do it expeditiously \nbecause I think the question needs to be answered.\n    If it is that the DOJ can go on a fishing expedition to \nhospitals and doctors and seek medical records, I think we have \nan obligation to make sure that the privacy acts that we have \nworked so hard on protect their rights. I certainly think any \nwoman or anybody who has a daughter or anybody who may have \nsought health care protections or decisions that are very, very \nprivate and part of their own family and their own religious \ndecisions, should not be worried that this Department of \nJustice can ask for their records. So I would ask that you \nexpeditiously get a response back and tell us what HIPAA will \nallow under that.\n    I would hope, really, that DOJ take a quick second thought \nhere and realizes they should have sought your opinion before \ngoing on this expedition as well.\n    Secretary Thompson. Thank you."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    Thank you. I will ask you also a question \nabout the prescription drug bill, but I hope you can get that \nback to us because I am deeply troubled. I think many, many \npeople are by that.\n    On the prescription drug bill, you are going to be tasked \nwith determining different regions of the country, and as you \nknow, under that bill, the country's going to be divided up \ninto as many as 50 regions. PPOs will be offered within these \nregions, HMOs within the entire State, and the products that \nthese PPOs and HMOs offer will really determine the kind of \naccess that seniors will have to qualify affordable \nprescription drug coverage.\n    As we experienced in my home State and others with the \nMedicare Plus Choice program, senior can be facing a new \nMedicare program every year, and many seniors within a State do \nnot have access to those choices. That was the experience we \nhad under Medicare Plus Choice. In fact, in Washington State we \nhad two very different Medicare options for seniors, and every \nyear there were changes to the plan. Some increased premiums, \nreduced coverage, limited coverage, or even closed for new \nenrollees.\n    So I am really concerned as we move forward on this that my \nState could be divided up into more than on region or even two \nregions with a fall-back region. That would mean that access to \ncoverage would depend on where you lived for the first time in \nthe history of Medicare and could force health care providers \nto compete for preferred provider status.\n    I would like to know from you what efforts you are going to \nundertake to ensure that stability within a State and with \nStates will be there, and whether you know States like \nWashington, that are large and diverse, will see a number of \ndifferent regions that could mean different choices for \ndifferent seniors who live within the same State?\n    Secretary Thompson. As you can well imagine, we have not \nbeen able to get to that particular portion of the law because \nour attention had to go to the drug card first and to get that \nup and running. We are looking at all of the provisions.\n    I would like to point out that there is a tremendous, \nenthusiasm for the new Medicare Modernization Act. There are \npeople that were on Medicare Plus Choice and are now coming \nback into it. You are going to see a lot more plans coming to \nthe forefront. You are going to see a reduction in copays. You \nare going to see enhanced benefits, and you are going to see a \nlot more people in the market.\n    In regards to the State of Washington, I cannot imagine any \nscenario, just listening to you, Senator Murray, in which you \nwould divide the State of Washington up into more than one \nregion. I suppose it is possible, but I do not know any reason \nwhy you would do that. The law says we have to have a minimum \nof 10 regions up to a maximum of 50. We are looking at the \npotential of around 15, but in all of the regions that we have \neven speculated on, States are held together, and every State \nis held together in a region. I cannot imagine any way in which \nwe would divide it up at this particular point in time unless \nit might be a huge city that would be overlapping into another \nregion. But I cannot imagine that would take place in the State \nof Washington."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    As you know, we have regions like Portland, \nOregon that is right across the border from a----\n    Secretary Thompson. Yes, but I would think that Washington \nand Oregon would probably be in the same region."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    We will be following this very carefully \nbecause----\n    Secretary Thompson. Listen, before we make final \ndecisions--this is going to be a very controversial as to how \nthe States are placed in the regions. I will be working with \neverybody on a bipartisan basis as long as I am Secretary."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    All right. Let me ask you quickly then \nabout mad cow because I know you are working with FDA to \naddress a lot of the issues of the gaps in safety, and FDA has \nmoved forward on a number of initiatives to deal with this.\n    Secretary Thompson. Yes, we have."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    As a member of this Committee and the \nHealth Committee, I am really concerned that FDA may need some \nkind of legislative authority to continue to move forward, and \nI wanted to ask you if you felt that that would be necessary, \nor is there anything more we should be doing to providing you \nthe authority you need to provide the protections that are \ncitizens are looking for?\n    Secretary Thompson. As you know, we have expanded our rules \nas it relates to the composition of feed. That is a big area \nthat we have complete control over. We have strengthened the \noversight. We are going to increase the number of inspections \nby a great deal, and we are also prohibiting the use of downer \nand dead cattle into human consumption products. So we are \ndoing a lot.\n    We are continuing to address this. Les Crawford is the \nindividual I have tasked to do this. He negotiated this week \nwith the Canadians, and we are negotiating with the Japanese as \nfar as opening up the market, and we are looking at scientific \nthings. We want to base our decisions upon science. At this \npoint in time we have not found a place where we cannot go \nstatutorily, but if we do, I will be more than happy to sit \ndown with you."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    You know that there are many of us who \nstand ready to work with you in case you do need that \nauthority.\n    Secretary Thompson. This is very much a concern of mine \nbeing a beef grower myself."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    Mr. Secretary, I appreciate that. Let me \njust say, Mr. Secretary, we will get the question to you on \nwhether or not women who seek reproductive health care \nprotections are denied privacy under HIPAA. We will get that to \nyou today. Can I ask you how long it will take your decision to \ncome back to us?\n    Secretary Thompson. I would hope that my attorneys would be \nable to turn it around the beginning of next week."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    OK.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Murray, Thank you very much.\n    Senator Sessions.\n    Senator Sessions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, on the \nmedical issue that Senator Murray raised, as a prosecutor, I \nhave been amazed in recent years the shock people have that \nthey think you cannot subpoena library records. You can \nsubpoena bank records. You can subpoena medical records. You \ncan subpoena library records. There is no privilege for those \nthings under certain circumstances.\n    Now, if somebody objects, they can file a motion to quash a \nsubpoena, but Congress did vote to eliminate the practice of \npartial birth abortion, and I think we meant that. It was an \noverwhelming vote. The investigations surely are focused on the \nphysicians who may be performing those procedures if they are \nongoing. So I think you have at some point, any investigation \nto determine whether or not a physician is performing partial \nbirth abortion contrary to the overwhelming vote of this \nCongress should be investigated and you will have to get some \nrecords. if there is an objection, they can be objected to \nthrough the court system."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    Mr. Chairman, let me just say that women \nwere not party to the suit, to the----\n    Senator Sessions. But it is the records. You say they are \ntaking their records, but it is really the doctors', \nphysicians' files to determine whether or not he is performing \nthat procedure, and he would have her history of whether or not \nthat procedure was performed on her.\n    Your chart here showing your higher estimate on the \nprescription drug bill is more than troubling to me. I respect \nyou though. We knew, and many of us were worried it may be \nhigher than the $400 billion that was estimated. I know \nChairman Nickles raised that concern. I am glad you brought it \nout. I am glad we have your estimate here. I think it is true \nthat nobody knows exactly how much is this going to cost. Would \nyou agree?\n    Secretary Thompson. That is true.\n    Senator Sessions. Could be more or less than the 534 you \nhave estimated. I believe that Congress wanted to make a \nsizable historic step toward meeting the needs of those seniors \nwho cannot afford drugs, and we authorized, this Budget \nCommittee did, $400 billion for that purpose. I am just very \ndistressed that we passed a bill that it pretty clearly appears \nnow is going to go well above that. I think it is important for \nus, if we care about financial responsibility and sanity, that \nwe come back and look at this bill, and perhaps as part of this \nbudget procedure, to say that we want only that much money \nspent, and that if we have to have some higher copays instead \nof the 3 percent copays that are being paid now, maybe that \ncould help keep it within the amount.\n    So I am frustrated that the numbers came out higher and \ndisturbed by that, but I thank you for doing it because we need \nto know the truth and act on the best information that we can \nhave.\n    Secretary Thompson. Senator, could I just clarify?\n    Senator Sessions. Yes.\n    Secretary Thompson. CBO still swears by the fact that it is \nonly going to be $395 billion in its projections. CBO has \nexperts that are projecting on drugs that we do not have as \nactuaries. So I do not think you can truthfully say that our \nfigures are correct and CBO is wrong because they are not. \nThese are our estimates.\n    For instance, on the first one--and this is something \nSenator Nickles argued quite strongly against--is the fact that \nthe low income, where everybody wanted to help, is really wide \nopen. It is a huge subsidized benefit for low income, those \nunder 150 percent of poverty. That makes a difference of $47 \nbillion. We cannot say for sure if it is going to be $47 \nbillion more or $47 billion less.\n    For instance, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which is not \nnearly as complex as this law, our actuaries were $50 billion \noff from CBO and both of them were wrong. Both of them were \nwrong, in fact it came in at a different amount. And the second \none, the higher participation, the next big tranche of $32 \nbillion, this is the difference between 87 percent--CBO \nbelieves only 87 percent of the people that are eligible will \nparticipate. Our actuaries think it is going to be higher, they \nthink it is going to be 94 percent. But you have to remember \nthat in Part B only 91 percent participate, and that is what \nCBO is counting on. CBO is saying if you did not participate in \nPart B, why would you ever then participate in Part D? And so \nthey have a solid argument for saying it is going to be less \nthan 91 percent.\n    So it is just projection and expertise.\n    Senator Sessions. My simple view about it is you have \nraised--your official estimates raise the possibility that it \nwould be higher. Hopefully it will not, but I think as a \nprudent Congress and as a Committee that is concerned about \nmaintaining the integrity of the budget process, we ought to be \nthrilled that we were able to find and appropriate $400 \nbillion, but I think we have every right to tell the \nadministrators or the Finance Committee or others to keep the \nfigure at $400 billion, and I think even if your numbers are \ncorrect, we are going to have the most historic increase in \ndrugs for seniors ever. We have four people in my State whose \ndrug bill exceeds their Social Security bill in thousands. My \nmother's drug bill does. I see that. It is $400 plus every \nmonth. It will be a help for people. There is no doubt about \nit, but we need to be responsible.\n    Mr. Secretary, you have a reputation for being a good \nmanager and cutting waste and abuse. I have information that on \nthe Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education program--\nthank you also for supporting full funding for that and not \ncutting that program. Level funding is what you propose. But \nthere was a 5 percent increase, I believe, last year, and we \nnow find that all but 267,000 of that 5 million went to \nadministrative overhead. It is not getting out to the \nhospitals. I do not know if you are aware of that or not, but \nthat is the information I have. I do not know if that is a one-\ntime cost or just a rise in administrative cost. I would ask \nthat if you are not familiar with it, I would understand it----\n    Secretary Thompson. Senator Sessions, it better not be that \nway. If it is, some heads are going to roll.\n    Senator Sessions. I appreciate your approach to it. That \nhas been my impression of your approach to management.\n    Secretary Thompson. That is absolutely ridiculous.\n    Senator Sessions. I was disturbed to hear those numbers. \nPerhaps they are not correct, but I think they come from a good \nsource.\n    Secretary Thompson. I will look into it before the end of \nthe day.\n    Senator Sessions. Mr. Secretary, I appreciate your interest \nand work in dealing with AIDS, particularly internationally. \nAnd working with you and the Department we confronted this \nquestion of whether or not, or at least how large an impact \nunsafe health care has in the spread of AIDS in Africa in \nparticular. Some studies came out and showed rather shocking \nnumbers there based on studies that were in existence. So we \nasked your Department to review that and come up with a figure \nwhich they believe was accurate. You have contracted with \nsomebody. We have preliminary numbers on that, and I was \nunhappy, frankly, that they did not come forward with a figure, \nthey simply repeated really the language that WHO has been \nusing which is: the reusing of needles is not a major part of \nthe problem. I think even WHO estimates 2-1/2 percent of AIDS \ninfections in Africa comes from reusing needles, and 7 percent \nof more comes from unsafe blood transfusions.\n    The good news is, Mr. Tobias and the money we funded is \nimmediately going out, some money earmarked to focus on this \nunsafe health care, but I still believe it is important for us \nto have good numbers. What I do not understand from this study \nis that they are saying that the studies relied on by Dr. \nGisselquist and others to say the figure is much higher were \nnot good studies. Therefore, they conclude that they are not \naccurate and that is it not a major cause, needle reuse. But I \nthink you could take that other way too. If the study is not \ngood it does not say anything. Maybe we need more studies to \nget an accurate number. We need a number here, and I have been \nfrustrated by the stiff-arming of WHO, and even some in your \nbureaucracy on this question because I think it is a big one. \nWould you comment on that?\n    Secretary Thompson. Absolutely. Before I comment on that, I \njust wanted to point out that the Medicare Modernization Act \nhas some real cost containments for the first time. Part B \npremiums, those with incomes over $80,000, are going to pay \nmore, it is going to be indexed, and also the Part B deductible \nis going to be indexed for the first time, and there is a \ntrigger for 45 percent. When Medicare gets to 45 percent of the \ngeneral purpose revenue dollars going in to fund Medicare, \nthere is a trigger indicating that we have to come back with \nreports to the President as members of the Trustees, which I am \none, and to Congress, making suggestions on how we might be \nable to improve.\n    Senator Sessions. That is true, and Senator Nickles fought \nto get that in there. I would just say that overall Medicare is \ngoing to be difficult to deal with. We have not started this \nprescription drug program. We ought not to let it get out of \ncontrol before it starts.\n    Secretary Thompson. I happen to agree with you, Senator \nSessions. I also agree with Senator Nickles and Senator Conrad \non the questioning, and I think we should continue to observe \nthis and find ways in which we can enhance cost containment.\n    In regards to your issue, you have talked to me about it. I \nhappen to agree with you. I think it is a higher percentage, \nand I think we do need an accurate figure. I was somewhat \nnonplussed by the fact that it came back with--after we \ncontracted out. I think we do need further studies.\n    I happen to be very much involved, as you know, as Chairman \nof the World Global AIDS Fund, trying to make sure that our \nprograms and our funding goes the right direction. And we also \nhave just received a grant from the $15 billion special \nappropriation to ensure the safety of blood. This is going to \nbe done by my Department. We have been awarded the contract to \nensure the safety of blood. Needles are an absolutely integral \npart of that, so we are addressing this, and I would be more \nthan happy to sit down with you and give you more information \nas we go along and set up our program on good reliable blood \nfor Africa. But I also agree with you. I cannot disagree with \nyou on the report as far as the percentage of people that are \ngetting HIV positive transmitted by dirty needles.\n    Senator Sessions. We can take the transfusion infection \nrate to zero virtually. I think about 60 percent of the \ntransfusions of Africa are checked now. 40 percent are not. And \naccording to WHO's numbers, that represents maybe 7 percent of \nall infections in Africa. So we could take that to zero like we \nhave done in the United States.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Sessions, thank you.\n    Senator Sessions. My time is up. The Chairman is correct to \ncall my hand. Thank you for your interest in that, and I look \nforward to working with you.\n    Secretary Thompson. Thank you, Senator Sessions. Appreciate \nit.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Sessions, thank you very much.\n    Senator Stabenow."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","murray","Senator Murray","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Welcome, Mr. Secretary. I have many questions I would like \nto pursue, but I will ask only two different subjects, and one \nI know that was pursued earlier, but I want to revisit it \nbecause I was so shocked, frankly, by it, and that is the $20 \nmillion ad blitz that has been started with taxpayers money, \ntouting the new Medicare law, when in fact, other than the \ndiscount cards, no one will have the opportunity to sign up for \nit until 2006.\n    I have to say, when I saw the first television ad, and just \nwatched it as it went through, I expected a tag line of ``paid \nfor by the National Republican Committee,'' and was very \nsurprised to see that taxpayers were paying for it, given the \nfact that it went beyond what I believe are accurate \nstatements. I have joined with others in requesting the GAO \ninvestigation that they are doing, which we appreciate, and \nhave joined in writing you a letter asking that you stop the \nadvertising until we know from the GAO whether or not this is \nlegal. So I would ask, first of all, if that is something that \nyou would do?\n    Secretary Thompson. I answered the same question from \nSenator Conrad. I told him I would go back and review all the \nthings. I also wanted to correct some things, that I do not \nbelieve it is political. I think it is informational, and I am \nresponsibe under the Act. I read the Medicare Conference Report \nlanguage which says that I have to get out information on this \nnew Medicare law and the money has been appropriated to do so. \nThe best ways to do that is through TV, but we are also doing \nit through literature. We are also doing it through expanding \nthe SHIPs program, voluntary programs in the community, through \nthe Aging Commissions. We are also putting information out in \nmore than one language so that especially Hispanics are able to \nunderstand the new law. GAO is going to review it. I am \nconfident that they are going to come back and say that it is \nnot political, but if they do, it certainly is going to be \nstopped immediately.\n    Senator Conrad had a subsequent, if I would go back and \nreview the ad again, and I will this afternoon, and take a look \nat it, and that is as far as I am willing to go at this point \nin time."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    I appreciate your comments. I would like \nto share with you from my perspective in looking at this. There \nis no question that we need to educate people. Frankly, this is \nvery complicated.\n    Secretary Thompson. Very complicated."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    What is going to happen for people in \n2006 is very complicated because if they have at least one \nprivate insurance company and one HMO in their area, they would \nnot be able to go through the traditional Medicare mechanism. \nWould you agree that they will be choosing between a private \ninsurance company and an HMO if those are available in their \narea, is that not correct?\n    Secretary Thompson. No. They will also be able to maintain \ntheir current fee for service."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    They will be choosing. If they have at \nleast one private insurance company and one HMO in their area \nfor prescription drug coverage, they will go through one of \nthose two and only have Medicare as a fall-back.\n    Secretary Thompson. That is correct."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    So it is a complicated system. There is \nno question about it.\n    Secretary Thompson. Very complicated."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    That people are going to have to know \nthey are going to get a lot more information, a lot more \npaperwork. What others have called choices I would call a lot \nof paperwork, and I am not hearing from people, from seniors, \nthat they want a lot more paperwork. They just want help with \ntheir prescription drugs. But we will have that. But I would \nlike just a couple of comments----\n    Secretary Thompson. Could I just respond quickly to that? I \nwould like to point out that the enthusiasm and the interest in \nthe Medicare Modernization Act been overwhelming. At the 1-800-\nMedicare line. We have 106 companies and individuals and \nentities who want to put out the card. We have had a lot of \ncompanies that were in Medicare Plus Choice and want to come \nback, they want to expand and increase benefits and reduce \npremiums. So there is a great deal of enthusiasm. We want to \nget the right information out. I do not want to be political on \nthis, and I pointed out that the head individual that won the \nrequest for advertising happens to be an individual that is a \nDemocrat."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    But, Mr. Secretary, if I might, I \nunderstand the enthusiasm. Certainly from the pharmaceutical \nindustry that is projected to gain $139 billion from this bill, \nand I understand the enthusiasm from those who will now be \nsubsidized in the insurance industry and the HMOs so that they \nhave a more favorable position in which to compete against \nMedicare. I understand their enthusiasm. We know that because \nof that enthusiasm and those subsidies, that down the road in \n2010 we will begin to see, because of the change, fundamental \nchange in Medicare, that will be experimented with at that \ntime, CBO says we will see a 25 percent increase in cost for \naverage Medicare, for those who stay in Medicare. So I \nunderstand the enthusiasm of those who will make money off of \nthis bill.\n    I would just share with you I do not see the same \nenthusiasm among those who will be paying the bill and of those \nwho want prescription drug coverage in my State. We have been \noverwhelmed with seniors and with families who are outraged by \nwhat has been done. And my concern--and I will move on to one \nother topic--my concern is that when we talk about advertising, \nwe have a full page ad in Roll Call, and my staff reads that \nevery day, not one of them is even close to being able to \nqualify for Medicare. I do not know why we run ads in Roll Call \nwhen we are trying to educate seniors around the country. This \nis a propaganda item, but it certainly is not educating folks, \nand I think any lobbyist or senior official reading Roll Call \ncertainly has other opportunities to find out information about \nhow this works. I would finally just say that----\n    Secretary Thompson. I did not know that it was in Roll \nCall."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    It is Roll Call. It has been in Roll \nCall, and that is certainly not where my constituents are \nreading about Medicare, so that is a concern of mine.\n    Then finally, I would simply say that in looking at the \ntelevision and the print, when we say, ``So, how is Medicare \nchanging? Same Medicare, more benefits.'' I would strongly \nobject to that statement. Same Medicare? For those on Medicaid \nwho are now going on Medicare, if they want a brand name drug \nthey are going to pay more. Their formularies may be different \nand they may have fewer choices on prescription drugs. For the \npeople in my State that are on private retiree insurance today, \nthe anticipation is that one out of four of them will lose \ntheir coverage. This is not accurate. And so I would strongly \nsupport efforts to accurately educate people about the \ncomplexities and about the choices, and for those that will \nbenefit, we certainly want them to know about it. For those who \nwill pay more, we certainly want them to know that as well. I \njust have great concern.\n    Secretary Thompson. Senator, I would just like to quickly \nrespond if I might. I do not want to argue with you. Your \ninterpretation is different than mine. I think that the ads \nthat we are doing are very informative. I think the \ninformation--I wish you could listen in to the seniors that are \ncalling in at 1-800-Medicare, they are overwhelmingly enthused \nabout this opportunity. It is the same. You can stay in the \nsame Medicare program like you always have, and you can get \nadded benefits. That is the truth of the law.\n    Now, you and I differ on that, but that happens to be our \ninterpretation of the law."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    Mr. Secretary, in 2010 in the six \ndemonstration areas around the country, will Medicare remain \nthe same?\n    Secretary Thompson. In 2010----"
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    2010 with the demonstration projects, \nwill Medicare remain the same?\n    Secretary Thompson. I do not think anybody around this \ntable can say whether or not it will. It probably will not. In \n2010 there is going to be two more Presidential elections, \nthere is going to be three congressional elections----"
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    That is not what I am asking. I am asking \nif the law----\n    Secretary Thompson. I am just telling you, I do not know, I \ndo not know, I do not know.\nSecretary----\n    Secretary Thompson. And I do not think you do either. I do \nnot think it will be."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    Mr. Secretary, I do know under the law we \npassed that in the six demonstration areas around this country, \nstarting in 2010 Medicare is not the same. It essentially moves \nfrom a defined benefit to a defined contribution, and it has \nbeen touted by Mr. Scully, by others, as a positive change, and \nI am not asking us to debate whether or not it is positive or \nnot. I would argue it is not, but there are those that believe \nit is.\n    But my question is: is it a change? Is it different? In \n2010 if you are in one of the areas with the six demonstration \nprojects under Medicare, will it be different?\n    Secretary Thompson. In those six different areas in 2010, \nunless Congress changes it, there will be competition, yes."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    So it is different. So when we say ``same \nMedicare, more benefits,'' this is not accurate, and if you \nchange it so that it is accurate, that is fine. But it is not \naccurate to say it is the same because for many people it will \nnot be the same.\n    Secretary Thompson. Yes, it will be, Senator, because \nseniors will still be able to get fee for service if they so \ndesire."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    And it will cost more, up to 25 percent \nmore under CBO.\n    Secretary Thompson. But the seniors will still be able to \nget their system if they want to."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    It would be great if it said that in \nhere, that, ``by the way, it will cost you more.''\n    One other quick point--and I realize, Mr. Chairman, I know \nI am pressing.\n    Chairman Nickles. We do need to run."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    Actually, I will wait. Thank you very \nmuch. You have been patient, and I will wait and do the \nadditional question in writing. Thank you so very much.\n    Chairman Nickles. I appreciate that so much because I am \ntrying to get the Secretary out by 12 o'clock, and I have an \nadditional question I want to ask him. But first we are joined \nby former Chairman and the most senior person on the Committee, \nSenator Domenici.\n    Senator Domenici. Can you hear me?\n    Secretary Thompson. Yes, I can, Senator. How are you?\n    Senator Domenici. Fine. Nice to see you. You got a haircut, \nhuh?\n    Secretary Thompson. I hope so.\n    Senator Domenici. Looks good. I have to go get mine cut. \nNickles does not have to cut his very often because----"

break,break,break,break
"","","","","    [Laughter.]\n    Senator Domenici. His is disappearing.\n    Chairman Nickles. Mine does not cost as much as yours or it \nshould not.\n    Senator Domenici. You get half price.\n    Mr. Secretary, I have about five or six questions that I am \ngoing to submit, and I would greatly appreciate it if you would \nanswer them.\n    Secretary Thompson. Absolutely.\n    Senator Domenici. They are very important, and I just got \nthrough with a hearing where we had a Secretary who was \nletting, because of OMB or some reason was letting mail from \nSenators go very much unattended, and I do not want to get in \nthat position with reference to you. You have a great staff and \nthey ought to consider a Senator's question as being something \nimportant enough to be answered.\n    Secretary Thompson. If they do not, they will not be with \nme.\n    Senator Domenici. That is what I suggested to her, that \nthey should not be.\n    In any event, let me ad lib for a minute, and then get to \nsome written ones. First, Mr. Secretary, last year our \nPresident made a little trip to New Mexico. It was probably one \nof the most exciting trips that he has ever taken to our part \nof the country, and he came to meet with a group of doctors and \nhealth professionals on the subject of insurance parity for the \nmentally ill.\n    Now, Mr. Secretary, I think that you know what parity is, \nand I think you probably know that this had resulted in a \ndiscrimination of coverage for families with a member who has \none of the serious mental illnesses. I am not talking about \nneed for counseling. I am talking about schizophrenia and \nbipolar and the like. It is growing more and more obvious that \nmillions of families have no insurance, but do cover all the \nother things, cover heart conditions, cover tuberculosis, cover \ndiabetes, but not somebody who is egregiously ill with \ndepression.\n    As a result, the facilities that should be built and the \nexcitement of the careers in research are not what they are in \nthe other fields. Just think with me what has happened to \nheart. The heart has always been covered since they wrote \ninsurance policies. Just think if they would have exempted \nhearts, said, we are not going to do anything under insurance \npolicies for the heart. I would think we would have invented \nnone of the great techniques.\n    So here we sit, and the President of the United States \nsaid, ``I do not have to be convinced that the big mental \nillnesses are diseases.'' He said he had a personal experience \nwith a friend on severe depression. You might know about that.\n    Now, let me ask you, because we are about to get a bill \nreported out of Health Committee, you support the President's \nposition on this, do you not?\n    Secretary Thompson. Without a doubt. It is the right thing \nto do. I supported it when I was Governor of the State of \nWisconsin. My family is very much involved in this thing. I \ncompliment you for your leadership for years. It is time for us \nto get something done.\n    I also talked to Congressman Ramstad yesterday, the day \nbefore. He tells me that you have reworked a bill and it is \nable to come out.\n    Senator Domenici. Yes, sir.\n    Secretary Thompson. I said I would like to read it, but the \nconcept I fully endorse.\n    Senator Domenici. Mr. Secretary, there is going to be a \nmeeting of everybody, including your Departments and others, so \nthat when it gets beyond our Committee, which is going to \nreport it out, all of that work will have been done.\n    Secretary Thompson. Good. I would like to be included in \nthat meeting.\n    Senator Domenici. You will be, and the only reason I raise \nit with you strongly today, I do not want staffers going there \nassuming that they have to go through the whole business of \nwhether you are for it or not. I would assume administration--\n--\n    Secretary Thompson. You do not have to go through. I have \nstated it publicly before, Senator.\n    Senator Domenici. OK. And I am for arranging it any way \nthat we can be helpful to Senator Nickles on his budget, and I \nam also for limiting the amount, Senator, the percent, the \ncost, et cetera. Now, that is about all my big questions, but I \nhave one with reference to New Mexico.\n    As it currently exists, the Medicare reimbursement system \nfor health care provides and contains some inequities. We all \nknow that. Some are intentional because you could not do it any \nother way. Some we are finding out about. But the reimbursement \nfor health care providers nationwide vary greatly from region \nto region and from State to State. My home State, New Mexico, \nwe are reimbursed less by Medicare for services provided than \nother States. Some of this started way back when we first did \nHMOs and the like, and you are aware of that. Although certain \ncosts of providing care are more expensive in some areas than \nothers, and that accounted to some extent in the disparity \nbetween reimbursement.\n    But it is my theory that New Mexico is being punished for \nits own efficiency. New Mexico was foresighted enough to allow \nhealth maintenance organizations to penetrate our market, while \nmost States remained involved with fee for service providers, \nand you know better than I, were squabbling and arguing and \nlitigating about issues. However, because New Mexico was \nefficient, they are now rewarded with artificially low Medicare \nreimbursement rates. What would you recommend be done to \naddress geographic payment inequities that currently exist in \nthe system, and what if anything is HHS doing to address the \ngeographic payment inequities that currently exist in the \nsystem?\n    Secretary Thompson. Mr. Chairman and members, we are doing \na lot. The new Medicare law is making changes, and wage \ndisparities, for instance, have gone down from 72 percent to 62 \npercent in the law, something that I think is badly needed. It \nis going to benefit the State of New Mexico, the State of \nWisconsin, the State of Oklahoma and the State of North Dakota. \nThere is $26 billion of new programs for rural areas which is \ngoing to benefit the States of New Mexico, all the four States \nthat are here. We have been discriminated against for a long \ntime, Senator Domenici, and I would have to say that the \nMedicare law is a giant step forward in creating some equity as \nfar as reimbursement, and it is going to benefit a great deal \nfor the States that are up there, as well as my home State of \nWisconsin, something that I have been for for a long time, and \nI thank you for bringing it to my attention.\n    Senator Domenici. Well, Mr. Secretary--incidentally, you \ncalled me Mr. Chairman a minute ago, and that is OK if you were \nin another Committee, but in this Committee you should call me \n``used to be Chairman.''"
break,break,break,break
"","","","","    [Laughter.]\n    Secretary Thompson. You have been Chairman of this \nCommittee for so long, you are a Chairman----\n    Senator Domenici. Emeritus.\n    Secretary Thompson. --Emeritus, and I think you should wear \nthat as a badge of honor.\n    Senator Domenici. Now, Mr. Secretary, I want to tell you, \nmy friends here on this Committee that worked on another \nCommittee that produced Medicare, have just informed me that \nthe fix for the rural disparities versus the other more \noccupied States, that is the biggest fix we have ever had.\n    Secretary Thompson. It is.\n    Senator Domenici. I am looking forward to seeing the \nnumbers because, Senators, I want to tell you--you probably \nknow--but when you have a State as poor as ours, and you have \ndoctors and neurologists and neurosurgeons leaving, when you do \nnot have enough to begin with, and they say, ``Well, we are \ngoing over here to Texas because we get paid, reimbursed \ndifferently under the same law,'' you know, pretty soon you \nhave riot sounding meetings with people wondering what the hell \nis the Federal Government doing? They know with Chuck Grassley \nand some of them, we have made some fixes, but we did not fix \nit enough. Now we might have.\n    Secretary Thompson. I think you are going to be very \nappreciative. This has been an issue for Senator Conrad and \nmyself for a long time. He and I have been fighting it. Senator \nGrassley, Senator Nickles, I mean anybody that represents rural \nareas, this Medicare bill, that portion of the law was enough \nto vote for it.\n    Senator Domenici.

The last 4 years it has \ngrown at 9.7 percent, 13.9 percent, 9.1 percent, and estimated \nto grow 10.3 percent this year. There is some abuse in the \nsystem.\n    Secretary Thompson. That is right.\n    Chairman Nickles. Part of the abuse is what many of us call \nimproper intergovernmental transfers. I have been concerned \nabout it. Sometimes in the past we have called it upper payment \nlimits, but some States, a lot of State actually, have \ndeveloped what I would call a scheme to greatly enhance the \nreimbursements on Medicaid to where basically the Federal \nGovernment pays not their stated share, 60/40 or 50/50 or \nsomething like that, but in many cases it becomes a case where \nthe Federal Government pays all of it, or pays a much greater \nshare than frankly what it is supposed to do. Would you care to \ncomment on it, maybe explain it, or give us 1 minute? I know \nyou are pressed for time, and so I will not pursue it too long.\n    Secretary Thompson. Thank you for asking me the question. \nThis has been something that needs to be corrected. The law \nallows for local participation with the State in order to get \nmatching funds. Usually it is a 50/50 match. Some States are \ndifferent. Mine is 57/43. I do not know what North Dakota and \nOklahoma is, but it is probably somewhere around 57/43. But so \nmany States have taken advantage of the failure to supervise, \nthe failure to actually audit some of these accounts.\n    Let me just go through some examples of what we're finding. \nThis State made upper payment limit, quarterly payments were \nbeing electronically transferred to the nursing home bank \naccount. The State then immediately withdrew the amount of the \npayment from the provider's account less a $2,500 participation \nfee. The approximate amount of Federal Medicaid payment, what \nshould have gone to the local, that went back to the State, was \n$191 million. That was one State.\n    Another State made supplemental----\n    Chairman Nickles. Say that again. I am trying to get these \nfigures.\n    Secretary Thompson. We found $191 million in this \nparticular----\n    Chairman Nickles. One State?\n    Secretary Thompson. One State.\n    Chairman Nickles. So basically overpayment to one State of \n191 million?\n    Secretary Thompson. It was a wrong payment because it was \nsent to the State. Then the State has got to send it down to a \ncounty hospital. But the State, instead of leaving the money to \nthe county hospital, gave the county hospital $2,500 and took \nthe money back to the State and used it for general purpose \nrevenue.\n    Second example. Made supplemental payments to nursing \nfacilities. Upon receipt of the payments, the nursing \nfacilities, which are eligible for the funds, are required to \nreturn 99.5 percent of the payments to the State.\n    Chairman Nickles. Wow.\n    Secretary Thompson. That was $938 million.\n    Chairman Nickles. Just one State or is that nationally?\n    Secretary Thompson. One State.\n    Chairman Nickles. One State."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    Can you tell us what State that is?\n    Secretary Thompson. I cannot at this point in time. In \nprivate, I will be more than happy to, but I do not want to--we \nare auditing these. This is what we are finding.\n    Third example. State makes payments to county nursing \nfacilities. As a condition of receiving those payments, nursing \nhomes must sign a participation agreement in which the nursing \nhome agrees to return all but $10,000 of the payment. Those \nnursing homes are allowed to keep the $10,000 as a \nparticipation fee. The rest of the money goes back to the State \nto be used for whatever, and that accounted for $181 million.\n    The next one makes a payment to county home nursing \nfacilities. Upon receipt of those payments, the nursing homes \nare required by State law to return the majority of the \npayments back to the State. This is accomplished by an \nelectronic transfer of fund. That example is $18 million.\n    The next one makes a pro-share to county owned nursing \nfacilities. Upon receipt of those payments, the nursing \nfacilities are required by contract to return the majority, \nover 90 percent of the payments back to the State within three \nworking days of the receipt. They traditionally remit portions \nof the payments to the State. That was 40 million.\n    The next one is $1.5 billion. So this one----\n    Chairman Nickles. Can you explain that $1.5 billion?\n    Secretary Thompson. Yes. Make supplemental payments--this \nis a larger State--to large county nursing facilities. In order \nto receive the payments the county facilities borrow a total of \n$1.5 billion. Within 1 day these funds are transferred into the \ncounty nursing home bank accounts; from there to the State bank \naccount; and then back into the county nursing home bank \naccounts as a Medicaid payment. The counties then repay the \nloan to the bank. At the close of the banking, the State claims \nthe borrowed funds as an expenditure for nursing facility \nservices of $1.5 billion and draws down $859 million in Federal \nMedicaid matching funds.\n    Chairman Nickles. That 1.5 is that----\n    Secretary Thompson. Turns into a match from us of $859 \nmillion.\n    Chairman Nickles. That really should not be allowed?\n    Secretary Thompson. Absolutely not.\n    Chairman Nickles. We may want to have a hearing just on \nthis issue, and I apologize maybe for bringing it up late. I \nknew there was a lot of interest on the card, on prescription \ndrugs, the cost and so on, and I thought that was maybe \nprimary, but I am outraged at this, and I think it needs to be \nstopped. I want to stop it. Frankly, when we are running these \nkind of deficits and when I look at these double digit \ncompounding growths of Medicaid, it just has to be stopped. We \ncannot afford this. I know that you have a proposal.\n    Secretary Thompson. We do.\n    Chairman Nickles. That will require legislation to go \nthrough the Finance Committee, so Senator Conrad and I are both \ninterested in that, but I wish to learn more about it. I want \nto fully understand it. I have heard about county hospitals and \nso on.\n    Secretary Thompson. Can we put up the chart? You have just \na second?\n    Chairman Nickles. Sure, I do. I know that you have to be--\nyou have a commitment at 12:15 so I am trying to be quick.\n    Secretary Thompson. Dennis, you want to come up? Quickly go \nthrough it, Dennis.\n    Chairman Nickles. Dennis, welcome back to the Committee.\n    Mr. Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Through an \nintergovernmental transfer, this illustrates the process for \nwhich the county shares part of the match rate with the State \nwhich is permissible. But under this example--and this would \nhave been allowed through upper payment limits--that the county \nprovided $10 as a match to the State, the county provider. Any \ntime you have a public entity, you have a potential for an \nintergovernmental transfer, be it a county hospital, county \nnursing home, but counties are providers for a wide range of \nother services as well.\n    Under this, the county provider had a claim for $100. The \nState, however, a claim-back was for $250. This is a State with \na 50/50 match. The Federal Government, seeing a claim for $250, \nsays, ``OK, here is our share, $125.''\n    Secretary Thompson. So the Federal Government pays more \nthan the total claim.\n    Mr. Smith. The reimbursement is made, and then the county \nprovider transfers $150 back to the State. So the State has \nmade $150."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    That is a scam.\n    Chairman Nickles. So the Federal Government pays more than \nthe original cost, and the State makes money on the procedure.\n    Secretary Thompson. Correct.\n    Mr. Smith. The true cost was $100, but a claim for $250.\n    Chairman Nickles. How prevalent is this?\n    Secretary Thompson. We think about 5 percent. We think it \nis going to be--it is growing. There are drummers out there \nselling this service to the States in order to get a \npercentage, and we think it would be about $6 billion.\n    Chairman Nickles. $6 billion per what?\n    Secretary Thompson. Annually.\n    Chairman Nickles. Per year. I am very interested in trying \nto stop this, and I look forward to reviewing your legislative \nproposal, and we will work with you. I would appreciate it if \nyou could provide us more example that would help highlight the \nproblem and help us get our hands on the reason why this change \nis needed so we can sell it to our colleagues.\n    I will tell you, regrettably, most of our colleagues do not \nhave a clue about this. I mention intergovernmental transfers, \nand most people do not know what we are talking about, so I \nthink we will have to work to educate people first to make the \nlegislative change.\n    I want to thank you and also I want to thank Jennifer \nYoung, because I know that she has helped expose this. You have \nsome excellent staff. I want to compliment Dennis, who I guess \nis now acting at CMS, who has done an outstanding job, both for \nthe Finance Committee, and also in working in your Department. \nYou have a great team, and we appreciate your bringing this to \nour attention.\n    Senator Conrad."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Mr. Chairman, I would just add my voice and \nsay that is a scam, that is a pure scam on the Federal \nGovernment and the Treasury. That is tapping into the Federal \nTreasury in a way that is totally inappropriate and has got to \nbe stopped. I would be very interested in finding out what \nStates are involved.\n    Can you tell us how many States are engaged in this kind of \nactivity?\n    Secretary Thompson. 34."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    34 of the States. We have to call a \nscreeching halt to this because that is totally beyond the \npale.\n    One final point I wanted to make, Mr. Chairman, is on the \nMedicare Advantage, CBO tells us that the private plans cost \nmore than traditional fee for service even outside of this \nbidding question, so I do not know if there is a disagreement \nbetween CBO and CMS on this.\n    Secretary Thompson. There is."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    There is apparently.\n    Secretary Thompson. There is a disagreement."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    CBO says that it costs more----\n    Secretary Thompson. CBO still believes that.\ntraditional fee for service Medicare. The whole rationale for \nthe private plans was to save money, so obviously that is a \nproblem. Hopefully we can get to the bottom of that as we go \nforward.\n    I just conclude by saying I hope very much, Mr. Chairman, \nthat we go back in and find places where we can save money out \nof this bill that has been passed. When we go to $530 billion \nand it was supposed to be $400 billion, that is what people \nthought they were voting on. We have an obligation to go back \nand try to save money. We have a runaway freight train here in \nterms of the Federal deficits. We have to find ways to save \nmoney wherever we can, and I hope very much this Committee \nplays a role in that.\n    I thank the Chairman for the hearing this morning.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Conrad, thank you very much.\n    I want to make one final comment. Senator Conrad was trying \nto get your attention about some of the ads that were running \nadvertising Medicare and Medicare changes. I will tell you that \nI was a participant--attended a football game. This is when \nScully was still head of CMS. And I saw a blimp that was \nadvertising 1-800-Medicare. I was embarrassed. I did not see \ntoo many people writing the number down. I am not sure. I think \nyou do need to look at the ad campaign. I think people do need \nto be educated, and it probably will take TV, radio and print \nto get it out. I do not know about a blimp at a football game. \nMaybe I am missing the--I know in sales you have to consider a \nlot of different venues, but I was kind of surprised about that \nand did not think it was the best use of taxpayer money.\n    Secretary Thompson. I agree with you."

break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Chairman Nickles. The committee will come to order. I want \nto thank Secretary Snow for being with us today and thank all \nof our colleagues. We appreciate their willingness and \ncooperation to change rooms.\n    Let me just make a couple comments. I am delighted that \nSecretary Snow is with us today. A year ago, Secretary Snow \nassumed office, and he did so at a very difficult and \nchallenging and troubling time. The economy had been in a \nslide, revenues had declined for 3 years in a row, and the \neconomy was still very, very slow. I met with Secretary Snow, \nand others did, and he and the President proposed an economic \npackage to grow the economy.\n    And, Mr. Secretary, but you made a proposal to grow the \neconomy and you succeeded. And I want to compliment you for \nthat, and I will show a couple of charts to give some evidence \nto that.\n    The first chart is gross domestic product, and it shows \nvery significant growth in the last year, I think in large part \nbecause of some of the changes that we have enacted."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Look at the next chart, and it shows the unemployment \nsituation has actually improved. Now, this is a chart of the \nhousehold survey figures, and, granted, there is a difference \nbetween the household survey and the payroll survey. But the \nchart shows all-time record employment, and it is significant \nand it is real."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    The next would be the unemployment rate, and that shows, \nagain, we have had a significant reduction in the unemployment \nrate, and that is positive. It was, I think, something like 6.3 \npercent; now it down to 5.7 percent. So it is certainly moving \nin the right direction."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    The stock market has risen, as a result, greatly, I think, \nbecause of the tax changes that we made, cutting the dividend \nrate about in half and cutting the cap gains rate from 20 to 15 \npercent, which we did in last year's bill. It is up from $11 \ntrillion to over $15 trillion in assets in the market. That is \na $4 trillion increase, that is about a 40-percent increase. \nThat is a very significant increase. So our tax changes made a \ndifference."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    I would also just show the top marginal rate as a result of \nsome of our efforts. It was 28 percent at the end of Ronald \nReagan's term. It was 31 percent at the end of President Bush \nI's term. It was 39.6 percent at the end of President Clinton's \nterm. And we reduced it 35 percent. I might note we did not \ntake it all the way down to 31 percent; we took it to 35 \npercent. Again, I think as a result of some of those changes, \nwe have made significant positive improvement in the economy."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Mr. Secretary, you came in a year ago. You had a \nsignificant challenge that you presented to us to make changes \nin tax policy to help grow the economy. We did that, in large \npart following the outlines that you gave us a year ago, a big \nchallenge. And I think we have had some very good results. So I \ncompliment you for that.\n    We have big challenges now. The deficits are unacceptable. \nThey need to be brought down. The administration says they want \nto reduce them by half in 5 years. I hope that we can beat \nthat. I would like to accelerate that goal as much as possible, \nand that will not be easy. So I am going to be asking you some \ntough questions on how we can get the deficit down. The tax \ncode that you have charge over has a lot of tax revenue in it, \nbut it also has a lot of expenditures in it. And I want to \nexamine both. I want to be working with your Department to find \nloopholes. I want to be working to find tax shelters. I want to \nbe working to find things that lead to unreported income.\n    I happen to think--and Senator Conrad has mentioned it to \nme--there is a lot of income that is not taxed, that is not \nreported, that is underground. We need to find it. We need to \nbe aggressive. We need to stop programs that have significant \nexpenditures to them that have very large error rates. I am \ntalking about the earned income credit program. We need to fix \nit. We need to make sure the money goes to those people who \ndeserve it, but not to people who don't deserve it.\n    There are billions of dollars at stake, so we have a very \naggressive challenge. We have to get our fiscal house in order. \nFour or five hundred billion dollar deficits are not \nacceptable. And I plan on doing everything I can in this year, \nin this budget, working with you, maybe in- or outside of a \nreconciliation package, but I want to do as much as we can to \nget our fiscal house restored. I look forward to working with \nyou, but, again, I want to compliment you for your first year \nin service. I think you have had a remarkable, successful \ntenure as Secretary of the Treasury, and I compliment you and \nthe President for the results that I have just illustrated.\n    I call on my colleague and friend, Senator Conrad."

break,break,break,break
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and let me just \nstart by saying how welcome this discussion has been from you \nthis morning with respect to the need to get deficits down. You \nhave said this at a number of our meetings, and I agree with \nyou entirely. These deficits are too large. They are \nunacceptable and we need to make far more progress than is \nbeing suggested.\n    We have to look on the spending side of the equation, and \nwe have to look on the revenue side of the equation. I agree \nwith you entirely that one of the areas we need to look at on \nthe revenue side of the equation is this tax gap, the \ndifference between what is being paid and what is being owed. \nThe Revenue Service now says that is over $250 billion a year. \nThat is a stunning amount of leakage in the system.\n    There is one thing the chairman did not mention, and let me \njust put it up in terms of--and that is the growth of the \ndeficit. And it has been dramatic, and it is of record \nproportion. The deficit now in dollar terms is by far the \nbiggest it has ever been. Last year was a record, and this year \nsurpassed it by more than $100 billion.\n    Mr. Secretary, I mentioned to you when I greeted you that I \nwanted to recall some of my favorite Secretary Snow quotes from \nbefore you were Secretary. This is my all-time favorite: ``A \nbalanced Federal budget is the best choice to ensure a bright \nfuture for the Nation's economy.'' Yesterday you were talking \nin the Finance Committee about how we have to pay attention to \nthe economy. That is what creates jobs. And I entirely agree. \nAnd the question is how threatening the pile-up of deficits and \ndebt are to a vibrant economy."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Let's go to the next. I also remember well this ad that \nappeared in major newspapers that you were a signatory to. I \nvery much applauded you at the time. The headline was: \n``Without a balanced budget the party's over, no matter which \nparty you're in.'' And I agree with that sentiment as well. We \nhave to get back to balance as quickly as possible, given \nespecially the baby-boom generation which is about to retire."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    But when I look at the President's budget proposal and the \nsuggestion that he is going to cut the deficit in half, it is \nsimply not credible to me and I do not think it is credible to \nanybody that takes a hard look at what the assumptions are, \nbecause the President has achieved a reduction by largely \nleaving out substantial parts of the budget."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    The President is saying that the deficit 5 years from now \nwill be cut in half to $237 billion. But in that same year, he \nwill be taking under his plan $259 billion from the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund, every penny of which has to be paid back. \nIn addition, he will be taking $23 billion from the Medicare \nTrust Fund. And if we are going to continue to address the \nproblem with the alternative minimum tax, which is rapidly \ngrowing into a crisis. Three million people affected now by \nwhat is supposed to be a millionaire's tax, there are going to \nbe 40 million people affected by the end of this budget period. \nIt is becoming a middle-class tax increase. That costs $55 \nbillion to fix. The President just left it out. And it costs \n$30 billion, according to the CBO, for residual work costs in \nthat year. All of these things are left out, and so you have an \nincrease in debt in that year not of $237 billion but of over \n$600 billion.\n    Let me go to the next, because the President's own budget \nshows in the fifth year that the debt is going to increase not \nby $237 billion, but the debt is going to increase by $633 \nbillion."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Let's go to the next. Here is the problem that I see. If we \nadjust what the President is saying for the effect of his tax \ncuts beyond the 5 years, the alternative minimum tax problem, \nand his defense policies--not, you know, this idea that defense \ncosts will not grow for the war after September 30th, but put \nin what CBO tells us is going to happen. We don't see the \ndeficits being reduced for the next 10 years. We see an ocean \nof red ink.\n    Let's go to the next one. Here are part of the reasons why. \nOne, we are not accounting for the $2.4 trillion of Social \nSecurity money that is going to be taken--$2.4 trillion during \nthis next 10 years, every penny of which has to be paid back. \nThe President just shows the effect of the first 5 years of his \ntax cut proposal, and what you can see is this dotted line is \nthe fifth year. The cost of the tax cut explodes beyond the 5-\nyear window. We have to account for that if we are going to be \naccurate with people."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Let's go to the next one. The alternative minimum tax, the \nsame kind of pattern. The President pays for it in the first \nyear, but the cost of fixing it, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office, explodes in these outer years.\n    And, of course, war costs. The President says no war costs \npast September 30th. The Congressional Budget Office tells us \n$280 billion of costs, none of this accounted for in the \nPresident's budget.\n    The result is we have a debt that is not under control, but \na debt that is skyrocketing, and at the worst possible time--\nright before the baby boomers start to retire."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    So, Mr. Secretary, I think we have a lot of work to do to \nget serious about the growth of deficits and debt and the risk \nthat that growth poses for our economic security.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Conrad, thank you very much.\n    Mr. Secretary, we are delighted to have you with us, and \nplease make your presentation, and then we will have a few \nquestions."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","STATEMENT OF HON."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Secretary Snow. I think I am on here. I am not sure.\n    Chairman Nickles. You are.\n    Secretary Snow. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, Senator \nConrad, members of the Senate Budget Committee. It is an honor \nto be before you, and I appreciate, Mr. Chairman, your opening \ncomments and those of Senator Conrad as well.\n    The budget that is before you reflects basically four \npriorities:\n    One, winning the war on terror. That has to be at the \ncenter of everything that we are engaged in today. It has to be \na national priority of the highest rank, as the President said \nin his State of the Union message, and protecting the homeland \nthat goes hand in hand with that. And the budget reflects that \nwith some 7-percent increase in defense spending and some 10-\npercent increase in the homeland security budget, which isn't \nfound just in the Department of Homeland Security but \nthroughout many other agencies as well.\n    And the budget reflects the President's commitment to \ncontinuing to keep the economy on a path of creating jobs, \ngrowing and expanding, because a bigger economy is good to deal \nwith the problems of the future, the problems of how we are \ngoing to pay for the Social Security and the Medicare \nresponsibilities of the future, fund those unfunded \ncommitments.\n    But it also reflects a commitment, Mr. Chairman, in line \nwith your suggestion, that we really have to get serious about \nthe deficit, and those of Senator Conrad as well. The \nPresident's budget seeks to cut the deficit in half within 5 \nyears. If we can do better than that, that is terrific. We \nreally ought to be pointing toward a convergence to zero. That \nis where we need to do. We need to get on a path to truly \nbalanced budgets. But you can only do it through two ways. \nThere aren't a lot of avenues open to us. One is growing the \neconomy because that creates more governmental revenues, and, \nof course, back in the late 1990's, when the surpluses \ndeveloped, 2000, we had extraordinarily high governmental \nrevenues coming in: receipts from the good stock market, from \ncapital gains, from a full-employment economy, and from high \nprofitability.\n    We had the recession. Government receipts fell down. Now \nthey are at quite low levels, but we project them to go back up \ntoward the 18-percent average that they have been historically, \n18 percent of GDP as they historically have been, down to 16 \ntoday, 15.7.\n    The other thing to do, though, in addition to growing the \neconomy, you have to cut spending, and spending cuts have to be \nat the forefront of achieving that objective. That is why the \nhighway bill is so important to the President and to many of \nyou, because it represents spending levels that, if embraced in \nthe actions of the Congress, will make it difficult ever to hit \nthose targets, important as and good as much that is in that \nbill is. Actually, I would acknowledge it, but it has to be \ndone within restraints of a fiscal balance.\n    I appreciated very much your comments on where the economy \nis today. It is really in a tremendously different and better \nposture today than when I appeared before you a year ago. There \nwas a lot of talk of a double-dip recession. Then there was \ntalk of deflation--deflation that could become destabilizing. \nEven those who were fairly optimistic a year ago about the \neconomy acknowledged that it was on a wobbly path; it was an \nanemic pickup. Today, nobody says that. I think today everybody \nacknowledges that the economy is on a strong growth path, with \nthe numbers you showed, extraordinary growth--for the year as a \nwhole, 4.4 percent; third quarter, over 8 percent, with \nprojections for over 4 percent for this year. If we can sustain \nthat--and I think we can--we are going to create a lot of jobs \nin this economy, as Chairman Greenspan has said, as the private \nforecasters say, as the administration says.\n    I think it is important to recognize where we have come \nfrom. These deficits are large. They are unwelcome. They are \nunacceptable. And they must be brought in line. They have to be \nreduced.\n    But they are understandable, too. They are understandable \nin the context of the President having inherited a recession \nthat took a tremendous amount of revenue out of the Government \nreceipts, and a recession that was made worse by corporate \nscandals, by the meltdown of the stock market that took $7 \ntrillion out of the household wealth of the country, by 9/11, \nthe war in Afghanistan, the war in Iraq. All of those things \nhave had significant effects on the economy.\n    When I talk to business people from other parts of the \nworld, they are astonished that the American economy has \nsustained itself as well as it has through all this period, and \nthat is, I think, a compliment to the resourcefulness of the \nAmerican people and to the adept ability of our institutions, \nincluding the Congress, which responded with the tax bill last \nyear.\n    Let me close by saying that without the tax bill last year, \nMr. Chairman, members of the committee, the economy would not \nbe where it is today. Without that tax bill we never would have \nhad growth rates of 8.2 percent in the third quarter and 4.4 \nfor the year.\n    I will remind you, we started the year with a growth rate \nof 1.4 percent for the first quarter, a stock market that over \nthe course of the year gained something well over 20 percent, \ncreating, as you said, nearly $4 trillion of additional value \nfrom then until now. The reductions you made in dividend taxes \nand the reductions you made in capital gains taxes, the \nlowering of marginal tax rates across the board have had a \nprofound effect on this economy and have created a strong \nupward movement in the economy that otherwise simply would not \nhave existed.\n    We regret the deficits. We are going to go after the \ndeficits. They have to be reduced. They do threaten long-term \nprosperity. But working together, I think we can manage our way \nthrough that problem.\n    I thank you very much for the opportunity to appear before \nyou."

"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Chairman Nickles. Mr. Secretary, thank you very much for \nyour opening remarks.\n    I will ask all of my colleagues--we do not have strict time \nlimit, but I am going to assume the Secretary needs to get out \naround 12. So if people could try and keep their remarks to 7 \nor 8 minutes, we ought to be able to accommodate that, and we \nwill have some flexibility if necessary.\n    A couple comments. I mentioned to you and Senator Conrad \nthat there might be $250 billion of leakage or uncollected \nreceipts that might be out there, underground economy, you name \nit. I will just ask you a couple questions. Is that figure \nclose to being accurate? Are there some things we could do that \nwe are not doing to help close that leakage or to collect taxes \nthat are due but not paid?\n    Secretary Snow. Mr. Chairman, that number I think is a \nnumber that goes back some years. There clearly is a tax gap. \nThere is an underground economy. There are people who should be \npaying taxes who aren't paying taxes. There are people paying \ntaxes who should be paying more taxes. There clearly is a tax \ngap.\n    I don't know that the $250 billion number is accurate \nanymore, but it is a large number, whatever it is, and the IRS \nis doing a study with the help of Treasury, the assistance of \nTreasury, to try and get a better handle on it.\n    We do know there are some programs that do not work well. \nThe one you mentioned, the earned income tax credit, will \nrequire some improvements because there are both underpayments \nand overpayments there.\n    The IRS budget this year, Mr. Chairman, reflects a very \nlarge increase--I think it some $300 million, roughly--\nprimarily devoted to greater enforcement. We think we need to \nput more energy into compliance, more effort into compliance \nacross the board, for business, small business, large business, \nbut taxpayers generally in all income categories. And I hope we \nwill see that significant enhancement of the IRS budget for \nenforcement carry the day.\n    Chairman Nickles. Mr. Secretary, just a couple comments. \nOne, I would appreciate it if you and/or the IRS, which is \nunder your domain, would give us a list of, I am going to say, \nloopholes, for lack of a better word. I will just mention a \ncouple. I mentioned the earned income credit. In 1999, IRS \nestimated that between 27 and 31.7 percent of claims were in \nerror, should not have been made. That was an estimate of $8.5 \nto $9.9 billion. That was in 1999, and we were spending $31 \nbillion on the program. We now are spending almost $35 billion. \nThis is a program, keep in mind, that cost about $7.5 billion \nin 1990 and now costs $35 billion. People wonder how spending \nhas grown. That program has gone up by a multiple of about 5 \ntimes, 500 percent in the last 14 years.\n    But it is not acceptable to have a program that has an \nerror rate of 30 percent. Senator Sessions has suggested maybe \nwe should make those payments on a monthly basis instead of an \nannual basis and take out some of the incentives for corruption \nand fraud. That is a proposal.\n    Anyway, I would solicit from you and from your outstanding \nstaff some possible ways to address fraud--some of this is \ngoing to require legislation. So give us some recommendations, \nif you would, and if you would also give us a list of other \nabuses.\n    There is one that I will ask about in my second round--the \nsale-in lease-out transactions that I think your Department has \nidentified. But this is a loophole, an abuse of the system that \nis costing billions, maybe as much as $28 or $30 billion over \n10 years. It needs to be stopped. It is growing dramatically, \nSenator Conrad said so.\n    I will get on to that one in the second round, but I \nmentioned earned income credit because I think most people are \nmore familiar with that. But this is on the spending side. We \nhave a lot of spending in the tax code, and we have some abuses \nof the tax code that at least this Senator wants to stop. I am \nnot really interested in having the IRS chasing down \nbabysitters and lawn mowers to make sure they pay taxes on, you \nknow, the $30 they have ten. I am interested in stopping a \ncorporation buying a non-taxable entity's assets and then \ngetting a lot of tax benefits and leasing them back to the city \nand have it be a shell game.\n    Senator Conrad and I yesterday, when we had Secretary \nThompson up, we found out that a lot of States were doing a \nshell game and costing taxpayers billions and billions of \ndollars. And we hope to close that loophole, and I hope that we \ncan close this. And maybe if we can discover some other things \nthat are really an abuse of the system, we should shut them \ndown earlier rather than later. So if you and/or your staff \nwould provide us some abuse list, we will be happy to work with \nyou to do what needs to be done legislatively. You may be able \nto do a lot of these things administratively.\n    Senator Conrad."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman----\n    Senator Domenici. Would you yield for one observation?"
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Certainly I would yield to the former \nchairman.\n    Senator Domenici. Senator Nickles, as I listened to you, if \nI were the Secretary, I would be a little bit confused as to \nwhat you want. So maybe I could ask you for a minute.\n    One thing is loopholes. People have a lot of arguments of \nwhat loopholes are. One man's loophole is another man's \nnecessity. But what you spoke of were abuses and places where \nthe laws were being used to cheat. But there also are tax \nexpenditures that this committee and the tax committee might \nwant to look at and say these used to be pretty good, but they \naren't any good anymore. And I would assume you want him to \ngive you both of those lists.\n    Chairman Nickles. Absolutely, and I appreciate your \nclarification.\n    Senator Domenici. Thank you.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Conrad."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    I want to again thank the chairman for \nintroducing these subjects because I think they are hugely \nimportant as we go forward.\n    Let me just say on the tax gap calculation, your IRS \nCommissioner was just on--I think it was CNN I saw him, and he \nreferenced the $250 billion, which, as you correctly point out, \nI think is a result of an analysis that was done in the mid-\n1990's.\n    Secretary Snow. Yes."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    I think we all know that number has done \nnothing but grow. And we have to go after--it is utterly unfair \nto the vast majority of Americans, American taxpayers, American \ncorporations that pay what they legitimately owe, to have some \nescape. That is just not fair. And I believe that number is \nmuch bigger.\n    I, frankly, have concluded we need to consider fundamental \ntax reform. I don't think using our current system and just \nincreasing audit and enforcement will ever capture perhaps even \nan insignificant part of this tax leakage. So I think we need \nto consider fundamental tax reform in conjunction with \nincreased enforcement.\n    Let me just go to this question of revenue as a share of \nGDP because it really does jump out at one what has happened \nhere. We did have in 2000 revenue as a share of GDP that was at \na very high level historically. Now we have revenue at a very \nlow level historically, the lowest as a percentage of GDP, \nwhich you referenced, Mr. Secretary, since 1950.\n    reuvenue as a share\n    When revenue was high as a share of GDP, the President said \nwe need tax cuts to rebalance. Now that it is low as a share of \nGDP, he says we need more tax cuts. Frankly, I do not think \nthat squares with the reality that we confront.\n    I would say that a tax increase should not be the first \nplace we look. I think the first place we look ought to be this \ntax gap, because there is an enormous amount of money that \ncould be recovered.\n    Let's go to the next one. This shows spending as a share of \nGDP, and it is very interesting. This goes back to 1980. We see \nspending got up to 23.5 percent of GDP. It came down steadily \nuntil 2000 to 18.4 percent of GDP. We have now had a \nsubstantial uptick, and we see that leveling out."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    So we do have a spending problem, but I hasten to point out \nthat 92 percent of this increase has been in just three areas: \ndefense, homeland security, and response to 9/11. So the \nspending side of the equation is going to be very tough, but it \nsimply has to be attended to.\n    Let me put up--this is my question. This was in the \nWashington Post on January 26th with an article headlined, \n``Weak dollar helps U.S. firms for now.'' The article said in \npart, ``Currency traders fretting over that dependency''--and \nthe dependency they were talking about are these massive \ndeficits, both budget and trade--``have been selling dollars \nfast and buying euros furiously. The fear is that foreigners \nwill tire of financing Americans' appetites. Foreign investors \nwill dump U.S. assets, especially stocks and bonds, sending \nfinancial markets plummeting. Interest rates will shoot up to \nentice them back. Heavily indebted Americans will not be able \nto keep up with rising interest payments. Inflation, \nbankruptcies, and economic malaise will follow.''"
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Let me just top it off with this. This is what has happened \nto the value of the dollar against the euro, which you are \nintimately familiar with after meeting with your G-7 partners. \nI am sure they were talking to you about this--what has \nhappened to the value of the dollar in the last 18 months."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    My question to you is this: Are you concerned about what \nthe IMF warned us about, what the Comptroller General of the \nUnited States has warned us about, what these economists are \nwarning us about: that this pile-up of deficits and debt could \nthreaten to put upward pressure on interest rates which would \nthreaten to reduce economic activity and that an early warning \nsign is what is happening to the value of the dollar?\n    Secretary Snow. Well, Senator, clearly the deficits, --\nunless dealt with--pose a threat to the long-term well-being of \nthis country and they, therefore, must be dealt with and have \nto be dealt with. I think virtually all the economists agree \nthat if deficits become embedded in the financial structure of \na country and financial markets view the deficits as entrenched \nand rising, there will be a perfectly predictable reaction in \nthe marketplace. Lenders will demand higher premiums, which \nmean higher interest rates. And that would be extraordinarily \nunfortunate.\n    One of the great boons to the American economy today is the \nlow interest rates we have. They have helped create a very \nstrong housing market, a very strong construction market, \nstrong demand for any number of credit-based consumer \nproducts--automobiles.\n    So I share your concern that we must deal with the deficit \nand that the deficit represents national dissavings. And we \nhave the Government dissaving through deficits. We have an \nextraordinarily low savings rate on the part of households \ntoday at 2 percent or so versus 7 or 8 in the past. And we do \nhave a large current account deficit, which is really the \ndifference between our domestic investment and our domestic \nsavings. And since our domestic investments, thanks to the \nstrong economy, are high--we have lots of good investment \nopportunities in America. We want to keep that up. But we don't \nhave adequate savings to fund it. We need to call on other \nnations of the world. And the current account deficit reflects \nour own national dissavings. I certainly agree with you."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Let me just conclude by saying that the \nproblem that I see is that the President's plan does not deal \nwith the deficits. Here is what we see happening under the \nPresident's plan with the growth of the accumulated deficits, \nwhich is the debt, and the gross debt is just going through the \nroof under this plan.\n    So to me the President has not given us a plan that deals \nwith the deficits. I would just ask you--I know it is very \ndifficult for the President, once he set up his budget, to \nreconsider, but I think as we work through this, we have to be \nmuch more serious about where this is all headed.\n    Secretary Snow. Senator, I cannot see the chart in terms of \nthe out years. That goes out to?"
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    2014.\n    Secretary Snow. This would be too long an answer, but I \nthink your debt numbers include a good deal of intra-\ngovernmental debt too."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Oh, yes. This is the gross debt. But \nremember, we have a totally different situation than we faced \nbefore. That different situation is we have the baby-boomers \nthat are about to retire, and we have been ramping up Social \nSecurity dramatically, $160 billion of surplus this year, $260 \nbillion in the fifth year of Social Security surplus, and under \nthe President's plan every dime of it is being taken for other \nthings.\n    Secretary Snow. As you and I had the exchange yesterday, I \nthink we are in agreement that we need to find a way to deal \nwith those long-term unfunded commitments represented through \nSocial Security and Medicare where--demographics are really \ndestiny, as they say, and the demographics are just about to \nhit us. I am in full agreement that we absolutely have to \nconfront the issue of our baby-boomers retiring and the \nconsequences of the demographics on these very large systems \nwhich will require us to take actions on a number of fronts, to \ndo things like hold down health care costs."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Let me just conclude by saying to you I \nagree with that, but I will tell you, you have to look on the \nrevenue side as well. But the 75-year costs of the President's \ntax cuts are three times the shortfall in Social Security. So \nwe have to look at both.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Conrad, thank you very much.\n    Next call on the Chairman Emeritus, Senator Domenici.\n    Senator Domenici. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n    Mr. Secretary, it is good to be with you.\n    Secretary Snow. Thank you, Senator.\n    Senator Domenici. My first question will be of great \ninterest to the distinguished former Chairman of \nAppropriations, who sits over here on my left. Could I ask you, \nif you know, what percent of this budget is appropriated?\n    Secretary Snow. Not offhand, I do not.\n    Senator Domenici. I should know it like that, but I do not."
"byrd","Senator Byrd","conrad","Senator Conrad","    About a third.\n    Senator Domenici. About one third?"
"byrd","Senator Byrd","byrd","Senator Byrd","    About a third. When I came to Congress more \nthan 51 years ago, the percentage was somewhere in the high \n80's or 90. Today it is less than a third, less than a third.\n    And one other thing we need to remember, when we are \ntalking about Government spending, we are also talking about \nfor the military, spending for the military and for homeland \nsecurity. But to hear these witnesses, you would think it is \nall domestic discretionary. You just think it because they do \nnot stop to say that.\n    Excuse me, Mr. Chairman.\n    Senator Domenici. That is fine. Just so I get my chance to \ndo a couple of questions, I am very pleased.\n    I wanted to amplify that by saying not too long ago, when \nPresident Kennedy was President, 59 percent of the entire \nbudget of the United States was for the defense of our country, \nand that much was all discretionary, if you can imagine.\n    The reason I raise the question, I know our Chairman works \nvery, very hard on trying to get the discretionary accounts of \nour Government down, and I commend him for it, but I really \nthink every now and then we have to be realistic when we try to \nlook at how big that deficit and how we get it down. We have to \nbe realistic as to how much of this budget is domestic. I mean \nyou cannot take 10, 15 percent of this budget is appropriated. \nYou cannot take 10, 15, 20 percent of it each year. The kind of \nmoney that is needed to get into balance is 10, 15, 20 percent \nof the budget of the United States.\n    I really think it is nice to go through this exercise, and \nhe will produce a budget that ratchets down this appropriated \naccount and we will struggle terribly, and when we are through, \nif we are lucky, if we are lucky, we will save 1 percent or 2. \nSo I want to make sure you know that because you are kind of in \ncharge of the overall picture, and you must know the overall \npicture is a lot more than the appropriated accounts.\n    Having said that, I want to suggest something to you. There \nis an old tax code sitting around your shop that one of your \nmen there knows a lot about. It is called the USA tax. You have \nheard of it.\n    Secretary Snow. I sure have.\n    Senator Domenici. It is the only reform measure that is an \nentire tax code, done by Senator Nunn and I with great help \nfrom the business community, and USA stands for Unlimited \nSavings Accounts. It was going to change our tax code so that \nyou paid money on what--excuse me--taxes on what you spent, not \non what you saved. But I would tell you there is a separate \nsection on corporations, and it might be worthwhile to look at \nit. It very well might work by itself. It completely changes \ncorporate taxes. It starts with the premise you are going to \nget as much money as you do now, but believe it or not, if you \nwere in business, how do you think it would be for business to \nhave no depreciation schedules? Would that not be exciting? \nEverything they purchased is on a cash basis. That is the \npremise of the USA. It is just a phenomenal way to change and \nput some energy into that.\n    I do not want any long answer, because I have some things, \nand I want to proceed.\n    Secretary Snow. Senator, I am aware of those proposals back \nin the mid 1990's. Former Secretary O'Neill, Leonard Alcoa and \nI and others were engaged----\n    Senator Domenici. You all raised the money to put it \ntogether.\n    Secretary Snow. Yes. And it had an extraordinary amount of \npromise and merit to it.\n    Senator Domenici. Mr. Secretary, I remember back in the \nday--obviously, I was not here, but I remember reading that \nPresident Dwight Eisenhower used to say--and lots of people did \nnot understand it and did not much care--but he used to say the \ngreatest thing for America is to have low inflation. A lot of \nleaders have said that. You remember when we used to struggle \nbecause inflation would go up and down just like a roller \ncoaster? And everybody was trying to figure out why, and some \npeople would say, well, labor contracts are all up this year. \nWe are going to have inflation.\n    The great thing that is happening to America is lack of \ninflation. Is that not correct?\n    Secretary Snow. Absolutely.\n    Senator Domenici. Second, everybody, including Greenspan, \nfor years used to say, Americans will be healthy. There will be \nplenty of jobs if we increase productivity. I just noticed, Mr. \nSecretary, and fellow Senators, that productivity in the third \nquarter of last year was 9.3, second quarter was 7.1, and third \nwas 2.2. Then it went along at 5.6 average for 2 years. The \nfastest rate of growth in any 2-year period since 1950.\n    Mr. Secretary, I am very perplexed and I do not understand \nany more. How could you have the two most important things for \na healthy economy, inflation under control and productivity \nhumming at the highest rate we have ever had, and somehow \npeople are running around saying this is a bad economy, No. 1, \nand second, that we do not have enough people employed?\n    Mr. Secretary, either these things are no longer relevant, \ninflation low and productivity high, that is one possibility; \nor we do not know what we are talking about in terms of what \nproductivity means any more. I believe it is the second one. I \ndo not think we understand productivity. I do not think we know \nhow to measure it very well. But I would like you to do two \nthings quickly, to comment on what I have said, and then \nsecond, would you produce for this Committee, if the Chairman \nagrees, an analysis of productivity and what it is, how we \nmeasure it, who measures it, and how much confidence you have \nin it?\n    Secretary Snow. Senator, yes, we will be delighted to do \nthe latter, produce that assessment for you.\n    Senator Domenici. All right.\n    Secretary Snow. On the question of inflation, I agree with \nyou. We are blessed with extraordinarily low inflation rates \ntoday. That is a reflection of high productivity. It is a \nreflection of global competition. It is a reflection of some \nexcess capacity that is hanging over from over investment back \nin the late 1990's, and it shows up in the fact that businesses \ndo not have any pricing power. Business after business after \nbusiness will tell you they simply cannot raise prices.\n    Productivity is also a terrific thing for the economy in \nthe aggregate because productivity means you got more output, \nand that means more potentially to share with everybody. Right \nnow productivity is probably having a somewhat negative effect \non job creation because businesses are finding they can produce \nmore with less, so a given level of output can be done with \nfewer workers or now a larger level of output can be done with \nthe same old level of workers. But productivity will show up as \nhigher profits in corporations and businesses and hire-free \ncash-flows. That will get competed away, as it always does, \nmarketplace competition. Then the employers will need to expand \ntheir businesses, they will be led to expand their businesses \nby the profits, and as they do, then the labor share will go \nup.\n    I think if we look at our national income statistics, we \nwill be in a period here where the share to capital will be \nhigher temporarily, and then it sets in place a healthy process \nwhere the share of the capital shifts and it moves more to \nlabor.\n    The labor markets are pretty strong, but given this high \nproductivity, Senator, there has been a slower pickup in jobs \nthan economists would have expected from growth rates as high \nas they are, but of course, as the Chairman said, we have some \ndiffering interpretations of labor markets given the fact that \nthe household survey is showing the creation of quite a few \njobs, a lot of jobs, and the establishment survey, payroll \nsurvey, is showing a much, much less fast rebound in jobs. \nThere should be a convergence there because they end up \nmeasuring the same thing, but right now they are showing \ndifferent results.\n    Senator Domenici. You would not like to be running for \nPresident and answer the issue about less jobs having been \nproduced by saying we had too high a productivity, would you? \nWould that not be a nice answer out there? Who would understand \nthat and would that----\n    Secretary Snow. I was trying to explain why the job pickup \nrate in this recovery is a little slower than the economists \nwould have predicted.\n    Senator Domenici. Yes, I understand. But you think it is \ngoing to get better in due course?\n    Secretary Snow. Oh, absolutely. I think all our forecasts, \nthe private sector forecasts, are for a good job pickup over \nthis year, over 1904.\n    Senator Domenici. Thank you.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Domenici, thank you very much.\n    Senator Stabenow."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","byrd","Senator Byrd","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Welcome Mr. Secretary. We thank you for your service.\n    To followup on what I thought were very excellent points of \nmy friend and esteemed Senator, Senator Domenici, on two points \nI guess, two points that I was going to ask about. First of \nall, when we look at how we bring this budget back into \nbalance--and it is astounding the red ink that we have now. I \nwas privileged to be in the U.S. House in 1997 when we balanced \nthe budget for the first time in 30 years and were focusing on \npaying down the debt, and it was a time of great economic \ngrowth for us. But Senator Domenici spoke about the fact that \nto only look at the discretionary spending side would not be to \nlook at the largest way in which to bring down the deficit. In \nfact, I have said before the Committee at earlier times this \nyear, this year's nondefense domestic budget, discretionary \nbudget, everything but defense. Homeland security, education, \nhealth care, non-Medicare health care, the environment, law \nenforcement, everything, adds up to $445 billion, which is less \nthan this year's debt.\n    So if you eliminated every penny of everything we did in \ndomestic spending and only funded the military, you would not \neliminate this year's debt. So we can debate whether domestic \nspending, discretionary, should go up, Mr. Chairman, a half a \npercent or a percent or 2 percent, but I share Senator \nDomenici's position that that is really moving around the edges \nwhen we look at the huge debt that we have. In fact, when we \nlook at this as shared GDP, 24 percent of what we are looking \nat in terms of the debt and revenue losses comes from spending \nas shared GDP, 76 percent is revenue losses and about half of \nthat is the tax cut, which leads to what I feel is a very \nimportant debate, and it goes back to what you are talking \nabout in terms of productivity and really world view \neconomically of how we look at things today.\n    We had an economic report released earlier this week that \nsaid basically if you can get it cheaper in another country, it \nis good business to do that, that on balance outsourcing or \nexporting jobs is a net plus for us. That is a different view, \nand when we look in the context of what we are seeing now, we \nreally have a world view that says focus on wealth creation. \nThose who have wealth, hoping it will trickle down, focusing on \nwealth in terms of tax policy and trade policy and so on, \nversus focusing on work and the value of work in America. How \ndo we get there? How do we get to the work part?\n    When Chairman Greenspan came in yesterday to the Banking \nCommittee, talking to us about the fact that it was surprising \nthat with the economic growth we have not seen the job \ncreation, but one question I would ask is we are beginning to \nhear theories about productivity that look at this larger issue \nof exporting jobs. One theory would say it used to take a \nhundred people, let us say, for a job in the United States. Now \nit takes 80 people in the United States, but 20 in India or 20 \nin China and 20 in Mexico, and that we are not looking at \nproductivity in a way that would measure that. So that when we \nlook--I had asked CRS to look at minimum wage rates around the \nworld if they were converted to hourly rates for U.S. dollars. \nIn China the minimum wage rate, compared to ours, is 33 cents, \n33 cents in Mexico. So there is a major push, even as you talk \nabout more dollars coming; you indicated more productivity, \nhigher profits and then reinvestment. The question is, where in \na world economy are they going to invest? It may not be in this \ncountry.\n    We have Electrolux, which is a plant that makes \nrefrigerators in Greenville, Michigan, a community of 9,000 \npeople, 2,700 jobs. Electrolux makes a profit in the United \nStates. They have added a third shift. They admit they make a \nprofit, but they could make a bigger profit by paying 2.50 an \nhour and no health benefits in Mexico, and they are closing the \nplant.\n    Mr. Secretary, how do we compete with that if we do not go \nright to the heart of smart trade policies, currency \nmanipulation with these countries that are taking our jobs, and \nfocus on more than wealth accumulation of a few? We need to \nfocus on work, the value of work, the value of a middle class, \nand the value of making sure that that household income that \nChairman Greenspan talked about to us yesterday, that is \ndriving this economy, buying those cars which we want to buy in \nMichigan, American made cars, and buying the refrigerators and \nbuying the homes, we are not going to be able to do that if we \nare being asked for our workers to receive 2.50 an hour and no \nhealth benefits, or go to China for 33 cents as an average \nwage. So how do you speak to all of that?\n    This vision that I see coming out of the administration is \none that is working for a few, but I do not see it working for \nthe people in my State of Michigan.\n    Secretary Snow. Thank you, Senator. The question you raise \nis a large one, and a critical one. It is really the central \nissue of economic policy. How do we make the American citizens \nbetter off? I think basically the answer is, by allowing the \ndynamics, the dynamism, the creativity, the energy of the \nAmerican system to play out. You know, you go back 100 years \nand think of what the country was. We were an agricultural \nNation, industrialization was just beginning. We had 40 percent \nof the work force engaged in agriculture. Today, as you know, \nit is less than 2 percent.\n    And yet, the standard of living, year after year after year \nafter year, as people left agriculture and moved into industry, \nand then left industry and moved into other things like \ncomputer chips and technology and health care and so on, we \nhave had a progression from low value jobs in the United States \nto higher and higher and higher value jobs.\n    The reason--and you know this as well as I--the reason \nAmerican workers have high wages is they are productive. Wage \nrates reflect the productivity of the work force. Our work \nforce is the best in the world. They have the highest wages in \nthe world. They are the most productive in the world. Our job, \nI think, in public policy, is to continue to create the \nconditions where the inherent talent and ability of the \nAmerican work force and our businesses can reflect itself in \nthe marketplace."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    Mr. Secretary, with all due respect, \nthese are different times now in a global economy. I understand \ngoing from agriculture economy to manufacturing, and we have \nall been told that now we are moving into high tech, value-\nadded positions, and we need to focus on education and \ninnovation, all of which I support, and I wish it was more \nreflected in this budget, by the way, since we do need to be \ndoing that.\n    But with all due respect, we are not talking about only \nmanufacturing jobs or low-end jobs that are now being lost or \nexported because of the pressures internationally. We are \ntalking engineers. We are talking about--in this report, at the \nbeginning of the week with the Council of Economic Advisors, it \nwas recommended that one of the ways to lower health care cost \nis by exporting health care providers, like radiologists. I \nhave friends of mine in Lansing, Michigan, high-end engineers \nwho are now in custodial positions because they cannot find \nhigh-end engineering or computer jobs that are being exported \nto India and other place.\n    This is not, at this point in time, just about an evolution \nof economics in a world economy. If we are not smart about \ntrade, if we do not address currency manipulation----\n    And I would just ask one question, and then, Mr. Chairman, \nI am sure I have used my time, but I just want to ask one \nquestion on that because if we in fact are saying we are \nproductive and can compete with anybody, which I agree \ntotally--when manufacturers sit in my office this week from \nGrand Rapids, Michigan and say, ``Just give us a level playing \nfield.'' By the way, they were outraged about this report that \ncame out the beginning of the week. They are saying, ``What are \nwe going to do about a level playing field and currency \nmanipulation by China?''\n    I would just simply ask, in conclusion, what are we going \nto do about that? Mr. Secretary, we certainly know that \nsomething is going on, and we would welcome, and we need your \nleadership on that issue.\n    Secretary Snow. Thank you very much, Senator. I think we \nare making some good progress with the Chinese on that subject. \nWe have engaged them. You know I spoke with Premier Wen, went \nto Beijing and had a long meeting with him and his economic \npolicy leaders, the head of the Central Bank, Governor Zho, and \nthe finance minister, Minister Jin, and a number of leaders in \nthe economy. We are straight with them. We said, ``You know, \nthis system does not hold together. It does not work. It is not \nright for the world economy. It is not right for the world \ntrading system, and you need to move to a flexible set of \nexchange rates that allows the market to set the value, rather \nhave you arbitrarily establish the value.''\n    We have an agreement on that with them. They have \nacknowledged the need to move to a flexible exchange rate. They \nrightly point out they cannot do it tomorrow because their \nfinancial structures are so rudimentary, but they are beginning \nto take steps. There is increasing talk about maybe moving to a \npartial float or a currency basket, but I want you to know we \nare very much engaged on that issue and want to hold their feet \nto the fire on continuing to make forward progress there.\n    Chairman Nickles. Secretary Snow, thank you very much.\n    Senator Stabenow, thank you.\n    Senator Allard.\n    Senator Allard. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome, Mr. \nSnow.\n    When the President came into office, I think it has pretty \nwell been established that the stock market began to decline \nwell before that election. Then when he was sworn into office \nat that time, that is when you started your 3-year downturn and \nwent into actually a recessionary period, and the President's \nplan for economic growth was to cut taxes. At that particular \npoint in time, I think relatively speaking to the history of \nthe country, taxes were pretty high. I agreed with the \nPresident that when you have that high tax rate, if you begin \nto drop taxes, then you will stimulate the economy.\n    We are saying that now. I do not think that anybody can \ndeny that the economy is not in recovery, even at the last \nparameter to change which is unemployment rates, and I would \nhave real concern for us to raise taxes in any sector of our \neconomy at a time when we are looking at recovery that is just \nbeginning. I wonder perhaps maybe you might comment on the \nimpact that raising taxes would have as we are just starting in \nthis growth period.\n    Secretary Snow. Senator, I would be very much opposed to \nthat. I think it is about the single worst thing we could do. \nIt would undermine this recovery, which as you point out is a \nvery firm and good recovery. I think it is singularly bad \neconomic policy that would jeopardize the recovery and put us \non the wrong path.\n    Senator Allard. I would like to followup a little bit on my \nstatement now on the labor market and the unemployment figures. \nThe unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent in January, and it is \nwell below the peak of 6.3 percent in June, and the payroll \nemployment increased by 112,000 jobs. But I want to go to this \nhousehold survey because the figures I have, they show a gain \nof 500,000 in January. As we move along, it seems like there is \na greater discrepancy between the payroll employment and the \nhousehold survey, and nobody seems to come up with an answer as \nto why this is occurring.\n    I happen to feel that it reflects, and talking to many \neconomists, they feel it reflects what is happening in the \nsmall business are, the self-employed area. I talked with some \nexecutives in the high-tech companies that say, ``Well, when \nyou separate your employees, you cut back, you give them a \nbonus or you give some kind of a separation stipend, and they \ntake this cash'' and they say, ``Now is my opportunity to go in \nbusiness for myself,'' so they start their business in their \nhome, and that is not really reflected perhaps in that. That \nhas kind of been my view and what I have picked up.\n    I wonder, perhaps if you have any real things that you can \nadd to that discussion that might enlighten us?\n    Secretary Snow. Thank you, Senator. You are absolutely \nright, there is a marked discrepancy between the two surveys, \none showing relatively modest, the 112,000 pickup for January \nversus the five times that pickup in the household survey. I \nmust say economists are sort of puzzled on this. I do not think \nanybody has a real good answer for it, but I would credit your \nhypothesis. I think your hypothesis may well explain the \ndifference because the establishment survey or payroll survey, \nas it is known, deals with established businesses.\n    There is a phenomenon going on that you mentioned that I \nthink is very real, and that is more self employment. The large \ncompanies, in order to shed overhead costs of pensions and of \nrising health care costs, are in effect outsourcing functions \nthat used to be done in the business. An H.R. department will \nbe outsourced and the people who used to do the pension \nplanning, who used to do the benefits planning and so on, are \nnow doing it, but they are not doing it as an employee of the \nABC Corporation. They are doing it as a sole practitioner. The \nhousehold survey does not pick that up the same way. It may \neventually pick it up, but it does not pick that up the same \nway the establishment does.\n    I had a friend come visit me recently to sort of illustrate \nyour story. He worked in a big establishment. He had a good job \nin a big establishment. He left, and he founded his own small \nbusiness. He now has 12 employees plus himself. And he is not \nin the household survey. They may get him eventually----\n    Senator Allard. I am almost thinking you have that \nbackward. Is it not the household survey that picks up those \npeople that are doing work at home and so on, and the payroll \nsurvey does not?\n    Secretary Snow. Yes, that is right. I flipped it on you. \nBut he is not in the payroll survey. I think there is more of \nthat going on, but we cannot quantify it very well. It needs to \nbe quantified, I agree. But that is a working hypothesis that a \nlot of people are now trying to test.\n    Senator Allard. I would like to approach this manufacturing \njob issue a little bit. I had an opportunity to hear testimony \nyesterday from Alan Greenspan, and he agreed with me that this \nis not a new phenomenon, that we have been seeing a decrease in \nmanufacturing jobs since 1979, and he agreed that that was the \ndate when we started seeing that phenomenon. But he also \nelaborated on it and said, ``Look, it is not only what is \nhappening here in the United States, but that is happening \nworldwide.'' I said, ``Even China?'' He said, ``Yes, because of \nthe productivity efficiencies that are being built into the \nsystem.''\n    I had a number of manufacturers come to me 2 years ago and \nsay the value of the dollar in comparison to the yet or the \neuro was so high that it was making it difficult for them to \nmove their goods and services overseas because they could not \ncompete. Now the value of the dollar has dropped down, which is \na good sign I think for our exports. It means that things that \nwe import is going to be more expensive, things that we sell \noverseas is going to be less expensive. I cannot help but think \nthat is going to have a positive impact.\n    Do you have any way of knowing how much of an impact the \ndecrease in the dollar is going to have and whether we are \ngoing to--I mean is this going to be sort of a sustained thing, \nthe drop of the value of the dollar compared to the yet and \neuro, for example, or not?\n    Secretary Snow. Senator, that is an important and \ninteresting question, but I have made a habit of not trying to \npredict where the dollar is going, or getting into commentaries \non relative values of currencies for good reasons that you \nknow.\n    Senator Allard. Sure.\n    Secretary Snow. But your opening point of manufacturing, \nthere is the secular trend, long-term trend that Chairman \nGreenspan talked about, much more pronounced on jobs than on \noutput of manufacturing. We still have a tremendously big, \nvital and important manufacturing sector. In fact, our \nmanufacturing sector, if the United States did nothing else but \ncarry on manufacturing, nothing else, would be I think the \nfifth largest economy in the world. I think our manufacturing \nsector has an output valued at 1.6 or 1.7 trillion, with the \nChinese economy at less than a trillion. So it is a huge \nvitally important sector. It is also a extraordinarily \nproductive sector, and its productivity rates have been running \nwell above the GDP growth rates. So the effect of that is, it \nis becoming a somewhat smaller part of GDP, but more \nimportantly, it does not need as many workers. It is staying \ncompetitive. If we can reduce barriers in the rest of the \nworld, which we are intent on doing, which is a tax on our \nmanufacturers, we can expand manufacturing.\n    But this recession was different in some ways in that on \ntop of this long-term secular, we ended up with a cyclical \ndownturn which was really harsh and dramatic. Senator Stabenow \nknows that being from a manufacturing area; Michigan, Ohio, \nPennsylvania, Illinois, and Indiana really were hit very, very \nhard by this and still have not come back from it.\n    I remember when it started. It started in the summer of \n2000, because I was then, with my former employer, a \ntransportation company that hauls lots of things for the \nmanufacturing sector, set up automobiles as a major product \nline. And I got the reports in from the subsidiaries, the barge \nline and the ocean carrier, the container carrier and the \nlogistics company and the railroad, and there was all the same \nstory. The economy had hit a wall or gone over a cliff, \nwhatever metaphor you want to use, and it has not come back to \nthat level yet today.\n    So it was a dramatic downturn in the manufacturing sector. \nIt is beginning to show better results now. Finally, we are \nstarting to come out of it. But the jobs have very much lagged.\n    Senator Allard. Well, Mr. Secretary, I know that the \nchairman wants to call on other members. To me, I think things \nare--our economy is definitely recovering, and I am pleased to \nsee it has moved toward a small business sector. I mean, I see \nthat trend. And I think that that is exciting for competition. \nI think that is exciting for our economy because it is the \nsmall business sector that develops--they are the originators \nof new thoughts and ideas and new jobs. That is where large \ncompanies come from. And I think it is good for the consumer \nbecause competition holds down goods and services and gives the \nconsumer lots of choices.\n    So I cannot help but be positive, bullish on the economy. I \nthink it is because of Bush's tax cuts that he put out as part \nof his program.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Allard, thank you very much.\n    Senator Byrd."
"byrd","Senator Byrd","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. \nSecretary.\n    My relations with the Secretary have been very good over a \ngood many years, and I value his work. I also value my \nassociation with him.\n    Secretary Snow. Thank you."
"byrd","Senator Byrd","byrd","Senator Byrd","    I think he and I both are supporters of \nAmtrak, which serves many rural areas of this country.\n    But on another matter, the Secretary speaks today about the \ncommitment to deficit reduction, and my observations lead me to \nbelieve that the criticism of the administration's commitment \nto deficit reduction is growing. And the price of loyalty--\nformer Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill says the administration \nput tax cuts and short-term political gain ahead of the \nNation's long-term economic well-being. Mr. O'Neill's says his \nwarnings about the risk of a fiscal crisis were dismissed.\n    The International Monetary Fund, which typically censures \nthe budget policies of Third World, debt-heavy countries, \nrecently warned that U.S. budget deficits risked destabilizing \nfinancial markets and stunting global investment and economic \ngrowth.\n    The General Accounting Office issued a similar warning, \nalong with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and former \nTreasury Secretary Robert Rubin. Even the conservative Heritage \nFoundation has blasted the administration's reckless fiscal \npolicies.\n    Secretary Snow, why is the administration having such a \ntough time convincing the American public that it is truly \ncommitted to deficit reduction?\n    Secretary Snow. Senator, let me begin by saying that I \nreciprocate those kind comments you made and have the deepest \nadmiration for you, and that goes back a long, long time that \nwe have worked together.\n    The administration is committed to this objective. We have \nto be committed to this objective. The future well-being of the \ncountry is what is at stake here. And as I said earlier, this \nis a deeply serious issue. We cannot afford to lose the \nconfidence of our financial markets. We cannot allow our \ndeficit to become a threat to our future. And I want to tell \nyou that I am committed to seeing us bring that deficit down, \nand bringing it down in real terms, and then going on and \ndealing with the longer-term set of issues that Senator Conrad \nand I talked about."
"byrd","Senator Byrd","byrd","Senator Byrd","    Mr. Secretary, my time is limited. I am \nsorry. But why is the public not responding positively to the \nPresident's proposal to cut the deficit in half?\n    Secretary Snow. Well, Senator, maybe it is our fault in not \nbeing more persuasive. I guess I need to do a better job of \ngetting out there and talking about what we are doing and why \nwe are doing and our commitment to doing it. It is a job of \npersuasion."
"byrd","Senator Byrd","byrd","Senator Byrd","    Well, Mr. Secretary, while the administration \nargues that the deficit will be cut in half over the next 5 \nyears, your own budget documents show the deficit will be worse \nin 2009 if the President's budget is enacted than if Congress \ntook no action at all. The administration's budget is filled \nwith holes and magic asterisks by failing to include any \nfunding for the war Iraq--this I cannot understand--failing to \ninclude any funding for the war in Iraq--to which I am \nvehemently opposed, I might say for the record, if there is \nanyone in here who does not already know it--or to address the \nimpending crisis in Social Security. I think the administration \nhas given the American people little reason to take its deficit \npromises seriously.\n    Now, if I might go to a second question, I know there is \nplenty that could be said on both sides here about that \nquestion I have just asked. But I must go on. Our time is \nlimited.\n    Tax cuts for the wealthy. On page 131 of its budget and \neconomic forecast, the CBO shows that during the Bush \nadministration, corporate tax receipts have fallen by $76 \nbillion; estate and gift tax receipts have fallen by $7 \nbillion; while social insurance payroll taxes, which fall \nprimarily on working-class American families, are at their \nhighest levels ever, up $60 billion since 2000.\n    So the question is: Why is it that during the Bush \nadministration taxes that fall most heavily on middle-class \nworking families are rising while the taxes that fall on the \nmost affluent are falling?\n    Secretary Snow. Senator, the issue of corporate taxes I \nthink is explained by the fact that the President inherited a \nweak economy, and with that weak economy, corporate profits \nhave fallen significantly, and with lower profits, there is \nless to be taxed, as well as the fact that many companies lost \nmoney during that period and, as you know, acquired these tax-\nloss carry-forwards and so on that they applied against their \ntax returns.\n    The numbers I have seen--and I will be pleased to share \nthese with you--suggest that actually after the President's tax \ncuts, the share of the burden of the total tax bill rises on \nthe highest income and falls on the lower income. That is the \neffect of taking a number of people off the tax rolls, 3 \nmillion in 2003, putting into effect the 10-percent tax \nbracket, the marriage penalty, and the child credits, and a \nvariety of things. But the net effect of that is that the \nlower-income groups pay a smaller share of the total tax burden \ntoday."
"byrd","Senator Byrd","byrd","Senator Byrd","    Mr. Secretary--do I have time for a short \nstatement?\n    Chairman Nickles. The Senator does. I will note Senator \nBunning told me he needed to leave at 11:30. If you don't mind, \nwe will call on him, and then I will call on you again."
"byrd","Senator Byrd","byrd","Senator Byrd","    Well, I would love to do that. I can't do it. \nI have to take my wife to the doctor. I am running short of \ntime now. I would love to accommodate to Senator Bunning, and I \nshall. Let him go ahead. I will leave and take care of my wife \nfirst. She is my first duty.\n    Chairman Nickles. You have your priorities----"
"byrd","Senator Byrd","byrd","Senator Byrd","    I have them straight. And I have had them \nstraight for almost 67 years.\n    Chairman Nickles. My compliments to you."
"byrd","Senator Byrd","byrd","Senator Byrd","    I have a lot further questions to ask, and \nall this business about increasing taxes, you see, covers up \nthe fact that these cuts that have been made are really \ndeepening the deficits, and the war in Iraq is deepening the \ndeficits. And we have these problems that are confronting us \nnow. It is one thing to say that we are raising taxes, but \nnobody says very much about the fact that the war in Iraq is \ncosting us--is not included in this year's budget. The \nPresident is not asking for anything in this year's budget for \nIraq. But it is going to cost us.\n    I will close with this final thing, if I may. In response \nto mounting budget deficit projections, President Ronald Reagan \nsigned into law 12 bills to increase taxes, including \nlegislation to repeal part of his 1981 tax cut. Similarly, in \nresponse to alarming deficit projections, in 1990 President \nBush's father made the courageous decision to break his ``No \nnew taxes'' pledge. Although President Bush's father paid a \nhigh political price, it was the right move at the right time, \nand it started the country's finances on the road to recovery.\n    Presidents Reagan and Bush were confronted with the same \nchoice that this administration will soon have to make, and \nthey concluded that the budget could not be balanced without \nrepealing tax cuts. In 1990, the Congress likewise concluded \nthat all pieces of the budget--discretionary, mandatory, and \nrevenues--would have to yield savings. Until this \nadministration acknowledges this seemingly obvious fact, it \nwill never bring the budget into balance.\n    Again, I want to thank you, Mr. Secretary, and I look \nforward to talking with you further.\n    Mr. Chairman, thank you for your patience, and I thank all \nmy colleagues for their patience.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Byrd, thank you, and best wishes \nto you and your wife."
"byrd","Senator Byrd","byrd","Senator Byrd","    Thank you.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Bunning.\n    Senator Bunning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Snow, \nthank you for coming.\n    I noticed in the White House budget proposal--and we have \ntalked about this prior, and I hope you have been brought up to \nspeed because the last time you begged off on it--includes $83 \nmillion for a new regulatory agency in Treasury to oversee \ncertain GSEs. I have spoken with your staff in the past about \nregulation of GSEs. Assistant Secretary Abernathy stated before \nthe Banking Committee that he believes that the Tennessee \nValley Authority, TVA, should be under SEC jurisdiction. And I \nhave a videotape, if you want to see it, just so that there is \nno misunderstanding.\n    Do you think that all GSEs, including non-housing GSEs, \nshould be regulated?\n    Secretary Snow. Senator, we have proposed that the housing \nGSEs be under, the Federal Home Loan Banks as well as Freddie \nand Fannie. Our proposals at Treasury have not gone beyond \nthat.\n    Senator Bunning. Well, you are not answering my question. \nMy question was: Do you think that all GSEs should be \nregulated?\n    Secretary Snow. All Government-sponsored entities----\n    Senator Bunning. Should be regulated.\n    Secretary Snow. Should be regulated. I am not sure what \nother entities you might have in mind.\n    Senator Bunning. Well, there are other GSEs other than \nFreddie, Fannie, and the Federal Home Loan Bank.\n    Secretary Snow. Who are not regulated?\n    Senator Bunning. Who are not----\n    Secretary Snow. To your knowledge----\n    Senator Bunning. Who are not being put into the new \nregulator that we are trying to create.\n    Secretary Snow. Right. Well, the reason that we are putting \nthese in is that they have to do with housing and housing \nfinance and present a very significant--play a very significant \nrole in the whole issue of housing finance. And in our view, \nthese entities have become so large relative to the housing \nfinance business and actually to the whole financings of the \nUnited States that a strong regulator is necessary so we can \nassure the soundness----\n    Senator Bunning. I don't argue that fact with you. I agree \nwith you 100 percent. I am asking you about those that are \nfalling outside of the purview of what you have proposed. We \nhave no one regulating TVA right now. No one, except they do \nhave $26 billion in debt on the market, which is considered \nguaranteed by the Federal Government. They are not regulated by \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission. They are not regulated, \nnot by any public service commission in the service areas that \nthey serve. And I just think that it is time we got a hold on \nthe three commissioners who make all the decisions and have an \noversight. And this would be a very nice time if we could \ninclude them in some type of oversight and regulatory \ncommission.\n    Secretary Snow. Senator, could I take a hard look at that? \nYou have asked me this before. The answer I haveten back is \nthat they are different.\n    Senator Bunning. Yes, they are different, but they are a \nGSE.\n    Secretary Snow. Well, the response I haveten--and I will \nprobe into it further to make sure I can really talk to this \nwith my own knowledge rather than relying on others--is that \nthey are not quite like Fannie, Freddie, and the Federal Home \nLoan Banks because they are actually--not just sponsored, they \nare owned by, they are the U.S. Government.\n    Senator Bunning. Well, the U.S. Government needs to \nregulate them, and that is the question I am giving you.\n    I really feel naked up here because I do not have any \ncharts to put up."

"conrad","Senator Conrad","byrd","Senator Byrd","    Do you want to borrow some?\n    Senator Bunning. Yes, I could borrow the chairman's because \nhe talked about taxes. You know, already expired at the end of \n2003 were the AMT relief, work opportunity tax credit, above-\nline deductions for teachers' classroom expenses, enhanced \ndeductions for donations of computers to schools, and medical \nsavings accounts. Those are already gone. Those were in the tax \nbills.\n    Expiring at the end of this year are R&D tax credit, \naccelerated marriage penalty relief, accelerated child tax \ncredit, and the 50-percent bonus depreciation. We are about to \njettison them at the end of 2004.\n    After 2005, small business expensing up to $75,000, it is \ngone, and $3,000 deduction for education and tuition expenses.\n    Expiring in 2008, capital gains reduction rate, dividend \nrate reduction, and there are many of them that expire after \n2010.\n    My question to you, Mr. Secretary, is: If we do not do \nsomething soon, most of the good things that we did as far as \ntax reduction are going to disappear. My question is: Do you \nhave a priority?\n    Secretary Snow. Yes, we do, Senator. A number of the items \nyou mentioned are in our budget.\n    Senator Bunning. I understand that, but do----\n    Secretary Snow. The R&Ds and the child credits and the \nmarriage penalty and so on. And I think it is critical that \nCongress act and make them permanent. I would go beyond that \nand say I would like to see the out-year----\n    Senator Bunning. The 2008's and 2010's.\n    Secretary Snow. Going out to there, exactly, because there \nis an awful lot of good tax policy embraced in what you did \nlast year that goes out, and if Congress fails to act on it, it \nmeans a tax increase, a large tax increase on the American \npeople.\n    Senator Bunning. That is what my--and in this recovery \nperiod, in my opinion, and in the opinion of a lot of people \nthat are smarter than I am, if we have a tax increase in this \ncritical period with a recovering economy, we will send this \neconomy the other way rather than allow it to grow as it should \ngrow.\n    Secretary Snow. I agree with you fully.\n    Senator Bunning. OK. There are other questions I have, and \nI am going to submit them to you in writing. As a courtesy to \nthe chairman, I will yield back. Thank you.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Bunning, thank you very much.\n    Senator Cornyn.\n    Senator Cornyn. Mr. Secretary, it is good to see you. I \nrecall a statement that I heard you make shortly after you \nbecame Secretary of the Treasury, and it struck me as profound, \nbut something simple enough that a humble barrister could \nunderstand, somebody who has not been, like you, very \nsuccessful in business or an economist or someone with that \nsort of professional training. And you said simply this, that \nif you want more of something, you should tax it less. And, \nindeed, I think that has been the policy of the President and \nthe policy of this Congress in passing the President's tax \nrelief and growth package, and I think we are seeing that come \nto fruition with the economy roaring back. And I am, like \neveryone, grateful for it.\n    Obviously, employment is not yet where we want it to be, \nbut I am gratified by what you have told us this morning in \nterms of your expectations, and I think that is consistent with \neverything I have heard from everyone who knows or should know \nsomething about this subject.\n    But I, too, share concerns about the deficit, but I think \nwe had a fundamental choice to make when we looked at the tax \nrelief and growth package, and that is, did we want to try to \naddress deficits alone at the risk of killing the economic \nrecovery in the cradle, or did we want to take a chance that we \ncould get the economy roaring back again and put people back to \nwork and then have time in a healthy economy sufficient to deal \nwith the deficit, as I understand this budget proposes to do?\n    But I also am concerned about when I hear members of this \nbody and the others on the other side of the Capitol talk about \nthe deficit. Indeed, you have been asked this morning has the \nPresident--or the statement has been made, The President has \nnot given us a plan to deal with the deficit. But, you know, I \nwas always under the impression that it was Congress who passed \na budget. Indeed, that is what we are in the process of doing. \nI always believed that it was Congress that appropriated the \nmoney to spend it, and the President's role, albeit that of the \nbully pulpit and given the power of the veto, that his role was \nreally different, and that it is our responsibility. So I just \nsay all that because I do believe that if there is an enemy in \nthis process, as Pogo said, ``We have met the enemy and it is \nus.''\n    I recall, finally--and I will lead up to a question--that \nas we debated last year both the budget resolution and we \ndebated appropriations, that there were amendments proposed on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate totaling $85 billion, or $1.2 \ntrillion over time, to add to Government spending. And thank \ngoodness we had the self-discipline to not agree to those huge \nincreases in spending.\n    But really what I want to ask you about is this: Yesterday, \nthe Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration had a hearing \non the President's proposal for a temporary worker program. And \nI must tell you that as complex the subject that you deal with \nevery day is, to me the issue of immigration reform rivals that \nin complexity. But one of the things that does make sense to me \nis that if we get people out of the shadows and onto the tax \nrolls, that represents a net benefit for the economy and the \nAmerican people.\n    Do you have any comments you would like to share with us \nalong that line?\n    Secretary Snow. Yes, Senator. I agree with you. There was a \ntime when Treasury had more to do with that whole area. The \nImmigration and Naturalization Service had been part of \nTreasury at one point, but, of course, now is not. And I agree \nwith you that is one of the more complex areas that we deal \nwith.\n    But the President's policy of giving an identity to these \npeople so that they become part of the recognized--they are \nrecognized for tax purposes and so on, will clearly help, as \nyou say, bring people out of the shadows and put more revenue \ninto the tills of the United States. They are here. We ought to \nrecognize the reality that they are here. And we ought to make \nsure that they are not part of an underground economy but \nbecome part of the regular and visible economy. Yes, I think it \nis a very forward-looking policy.\n    Senator Cornyn. And if I have time to ask one other \nquestion, I would like to ask you a little bit about some of \nthe concerns that Senator Stabenow raised about job loss. And I \nappreciate very much your concern and the President's concern \nand the concern we all share when people are out of work and \nthey want to work and provide for their families. Yet we all \nunderstand we are in a very dynamic time with a global economy. \nAnd the example that you used about the dislocation that \noccurred in agriculture, for example, because of automation and \nnow that less than 2 percent are doing what 40 percent of the \nwork force used to do at one time. And I guess we could all \nharken back to the day before the computer when it took a lot \nmore people to perform functions now that, thanks to \ntechnology, take less people. But the truth is that consumers \nhave benefited at reduced costs, but it does place a burden on \nus, I believe, those of us in positions to help, particularly \nwhen it comes to education and making sure we have an educated \nwork force that is capable of earning the good wages that the \nhigher-paying jobs that will inevitably remain in this country \nare capable of paying.\n    I know the President talked about that some in his State of \nthe Union as it relates to community colleges. Would you \naddress that issue?\n    Secretary Snow. Yes, Senator, I would be delighted to. The \nPresident in the State of the Union talked about his jobs for \nthe 21st century program, and the linkage between jobs and \neducation is just absolutely perfectly clear. And the community \ncolleges that he referenced in the jobs for the 21st century \nprogram provide the pathway to the training that gives you the \nopportunity to participate in the economy.\n    It is not just the effects of globalization that we are \ndealing with in this economy. There are really many more jobs \ndisplaced by domestic competition than from global competition. \nAnd that is evident by the fact that there are about 40 or 50 \nmillion new jobs every year in this country, but there is also \n40 or 50 million jobs where people are moving on.\n    I was at a community college in Florida, in Jacksonville, \nthe Jacksonville Community College, earlier this week. And it \nwas a moving and inspiring experience to listen to the faculty \nof the school--and they call it the Advanced Technology Center \nat Jacksonville Community College--talk about the effect this \nschool is having on the larger Jacksonville community. It is \nsupported by the business people who work with the faculty to \ndesign the courses, indicating what the job skill needs are \nthat they see coming along, and they in effect tell the \nstudents, If you get these skills, you will have a job with us.\n    Now, this is not just putting time in to get an associate \ndegree. This is actually learning. And the school commits to \nactually conveying the knowledge and hands-on experience in \nlarge part. And they told some moving stories. I will tell you \njust one that makes the point about how community colleges \nprovide the pathway from the present to the jobs of the future.\n    A cab driver who had modest earnings as a cab driver, who \nwent to the school, night school, and he would get calls, and \nhe would have to go, give a ride, and then he would come back. \nAnd he did this for two or 3 years and finally got the skills \nto get a full-time job at much higher compensation levels. And \nhe came back to the school with his first--he had never had a \ncheck before. He had always depended on these fares. He now had \na check, and he brought it back to the college, to the faculty, \nand he said, ``I just want you to know what you have done for \nme and my family by giving me the skills that I can get a full-\ntime job earning $50,000 a year.''\n    Now, there are a lot of people who are like that, who are \nlooking to get higher-level skills so they can move into \nhigher- and better-paying jobs. The community colleges are the \nlink between those people and the skills they need to get those \njobs. And he had not been displaced by global competition. He \nwas a fellow who had a job in the United States and wanted a \nbetter job.\n    And that is really how America works, people looking for \nbetter jobs and acquiring--and we need to make sure we give \nthem the ability to acquire the skills to get those jobs.\n    Senator Cornyn. Thank you very much.\n    Secretary Snow. I appreciate your asking that question.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Cornyn, thank you very much.\n    Mr. Secretary, I thank you for your presentation. I have a \ncouple questions, and I think Senator Conrad may, too. Are you \nOK? Is 12 fine?\n    Secretary Snow. Yes, 12 o'clock is good, Mr. Chairman.\n    Chairman Nickles. One of the issues that we have in the \nFinance Committee deals with international trade, deals with \ncompliance with WTO, and that is the FSC/ETI legislation. The \nbill that was reported out of the Finance Committee has a lower \ncorporate tax rate for manufacturers than for other \ncorporations. It has a tax rate of 32 percent, ultimately--it \ntakes a few years to get there--for manufacturers and 35 \npercent for other corporations, whether they be financial or \nservice."

"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    I personally think that is a mistake. I think it is a \ncomplication in the code. I think it is an inefficiency. I \nbelieve my history tells me that Canada tried a differential \nrate for manufacturing and repealed it. I would hope that the \nadministration and your office and yourself would lend some \nadvice to Congress before, in my opinion, making a mistake. I \nthink we have to pass legislation to be compliant with WTO, and \nI want us to do that. I do not want to see the European Union \nget into a trade war with the U.S. That would be a lose-lose \nsituation for both sides.\n    But, conversely, I would like to see us fix it in a way \nthat I would be willing to sipport. I personally would be very \ntroubled by having a differential corporate rate. I think that \nis a serious mistake. Would you care to comment on that?\n    Secretary Snow. Well, I agree with you, Mr. Chairman. I \nthink what the Canadians found when they had the differential \nrate favoring one class of economic undertaking over another, \nmanufacturing, that all of a sudden there was a lot of entry \ninto the manufacturing business by people who formerly had not \nbeen manufacturers, but for purposes of the tax code showed up \nas manufacturers. You create real distortions, I think, with \nthat sort of approach. The better approach would be simply if \nwe treated everybody the same.\n    So I agree with you, and I think we are sending that \nmessage to both the House and the Senate in terms of what would \nmake good tax policy.\n    We feel strongly that we need to be in compliance with WTO. \nBut we need to do it in a way that does not distort the Tax \nCode and create disincentives for one sector of the economy \nversus another. And we need to do what seems to me in a way \nthat moves forward--it cannot get all the way, but moves \nforward in modernizing this 40-year-old set of tax policies \nthat I think fundamentally prejudice the interests of American \nmanufacturers--American businesses, manufacturers and service \nproviders as well. You know, those rules came into effect \nbefore the United States had emerged as a great trading country \nwith 20 percent or so of our GDP tied up in trade, imports and \nexports.\n    We need to modernize that whole system and remove the non-\neconomic limitations on foreign tax credits that do so much \nharm, reform the rules that increase the cost of U.S. companies \ndoing business in foreign markets. I would hope at some point \nwe could go to the larger issues. Maybe some of them can be \ndealt with in the FSC/ETI. The more that can, the better in the \nFSC/ETI framework. But I see the priority now on just getting \nus into compliance in a way that doesn't prejudice U.S. \nbusinesses and doesn't create distortions in the Code.\n    Chairman Nickles. I mentioned I was displeased with what \npassed out of the Finance Committee. Would you work with us to \ntry to help us, one, come up with a proposal that is within the \nrevenues available, to be WTO compliant, and give us what I \nwould say is a uniform corporate rate? And if there are other \nthings on the international tax side that would help make us \nmore competitive--and you mentioned one or two, and Senator \nConrad and I have been around long enough that we know that \nthere is a lot of work that needs to be done on the \ninternational tax code. But we need to move pretty quickly. I \nthink we are looking at potential tariffs within 30 days. That \nmight be postponed somewhat, but it is important for us to move \nexpeditiously.\n    And so if you could help assist us in maybe coming up with \na package that would be WTO compliant in your view and would be \nfair to corporations, we would appreciate your assistance.\n    Secretary Snow. We will commit to do that, Mr. Chairman.\n    Chairman Nickles. I appreciate that. One other thing from \nmy opening comments, and I was reading through it a little bit \nmore, and that is the corporations that are engaging in the \nsale-in lease-out or SILO and qualified technological equipment \ntransactions. You are familiar with these?\n    Secretary Snow. Yes, I am.\n    Chairman Nickles. I was asking my staff for an example, and \nthey said, well, there are a lot of transit systems that are \nusing it. Senator Conrad is familiar with some others, and my \nstaff said it has already happened for leasing the Berlin \nsubway system. U.S. corporations doing this, getting \ndepreciation tax benefits, and it is a shell game. It looks to \nme like it is one of these things that I am alluding to that \nneeds to be stopped. It may be legal, but it is an abuse of the \ntax system. I am a person, who doesn't have to tell people \nwhere I am coming from. I want lower tax rates and I want an \nefficient system, but I find this an abuse, and I want to stop \nit and I plan on working to stop it.\n    Would you care to comment?\n    Secretary Snow. Yes, I agree fully with your statements on \nthat. The SILO transactions, which we have analyzed now, have \nno meaningful economic purpose or utility other than to create \na transfer mechanism for tax benefits. There is no economic \nutility at all. There is simply a mechanism for a tax transfer. \nI think they need to be stopped. The spread of them is really a \ndangerous thing to the revenues of the U.S. Government. The \ncost of the SILOs is so great that the Treasury Department has \nhad to revise its corporate tax baseline, because of so much \nerosion of revenue. It is really, Mr. Chairman, a critical \nissue and I am sympathetic to the States and cities and so on, \nbut the revenue they get for that is so small relative to the \nerosion of the revenues of the Federal Government, that it is \nno comparison.\n    And now, of course, it is not even our cities and \nmunicipalities in the States, but it is the cities and \nprovinces and so on of the rest of the world, Frankfurt and so \non, getting the benefit of tax transfers that is paid for by \nsubway system, paid for really by the taxpayers of the United \nStates. So there is something just fundamentally wrong about \nthis, and it needs to be stopped. Let us be real blunt about \nit, this is a real bad deal for the taxpayers of America.\n    Chairman Nickles. I appreciate your statement. I told \nSenator Conrad that I think part of our challenge now is that \nmost of our colleagues on the Finance Committee and Ways and \nMeans Committee probably are not aware of it. Since we are both \non the Finance Committee, we may ask you or somebody from your \nstaff to help us have an additional hearing on it to expose it. \nWe are going to send some signals that we are going to try and \nstop it.\n    There are a lot of banks, a lot of municipalities that are \ninvolved in this, but from my preliminary estimates, it looks \nlike for every dollar the municipalities are getting out of \nthis sham deal, the Federal Government is losing about 10 times \nas much.\n    Secretary Snow. A 10 to 1 ratio.\n    Chairman Nickles. That is not a very good deal.\n    Secretary Snow. If I can help you publicize what a bad deal \nthis is for American taxpayers and how abusive this scheme is, \njust call on me.\n    Chairman Nickles. What do you estimate the savings to be if \nwe close this door?\n    Secretary Snow. I do not have a real good number on that, \nbut it is in the billions of dollars, 33 billion, I am advised.\n    Chairman Nickles. I have heard about the $30 billion \nfigure.\n    Secretary Snow. 3 billion a year.\n    Chairman Nickles. If it is going international as much as \nit evidently is, it is pretty wide open.\n    Secretary Snow. It could be much larger than that because \nit is a growing phenomenon. I mean that is why I hesitated to \nput a 3 billion a year. It could be a 4, 5 or 6 unless we stop \nit.\n    Chairman Nickles. Thank you.\n    Senator Conrad."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Let me just pick up on that point and say \nthe Chairman and I have been talking about the need to close \nthat particular loophole. What is happening, for those who are \nlistening and watching, is municipalities are selling their \nsubway systems, they are selling even their sewer and water \nsystems to private entities, that then can take the tax \nbenefits from the ownership of those facilities, depreciate \nthem, for example, over time, and then the municipalities lease \nback these systems. This is truly a scam, and it has to be \nstopped.\n    I am advised that companies have gone to meetings of city \nofficials, national meetings of cities officials and pitched \nthese proposals, and now it is going offshore. The Chairman \nreferenced a Berlin subway system. I mean this has got almost \nno limit to its potential for abuse, and it is one area that \nhas got to be dealt with.\n    I would go back, if I could, to the other conversation you \nwere having with respect to FSC. I think we now have to \nconsider, in light of the tax gap, in light of our WTO \nchallenges, fundamental tax reform in this country. I do not \nthink it can be postponed any more. All of us understand it is \nnot going to happen this year in an election year. There has \nnot been enough time devoted to it.\n    I would hope, Mr. Secretary, that we could begin the \nprocess though, focusing on these challenges, the tax gap, the \nhemorrhage in the current revenue system, our WTO problems, the \nfact that our trading competitors have taxes that are rebatable \nat the border that confers an advantage onto their businesses \nand that we have tried to match this with FSC and all the rest, \nbut over and over we are ruled out of compliance with WTO. \nThere is a short-term solution, but I think there is a much \nmore fundamental need to review our entire tax system.\n    Let me ask you this question: what is the deficit; in your \njudgment, how would you define the deficit?\n    Secretary Snow. The deficit is, I guess, best thought of as \nthe difference between the Government's annual expenditures and \nits annual receipts."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    And what is the debt?\n    Secretary Snow. The debt is the obligation that the \nGovernment has to its creditors."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    I ask those--I know they are very \nfundamental questions, but I ask them because I find there is \nenormous confusion in the public because the deficit and the \ndebt, and of course, Mr. Secretary, you have defined them with \nprecision. I find when I am visiting with people there is \nconfusion between the deficit and the debt. When the President \nsays he is going to cut the deficit in half, a lot of people \nconfuse that with the debt.\n    Let me show you the thing that very much worries me about \nthe President's plan. I know this is very busy. I am not asking \nto try to decipher this, but I want to talk about--this is from \nthe President's budget. It shows the increases in the debt at \nthe end of the year. It shows the debt right now is $6.76 \ntrillion. Next year, at the end of this year, 2004, it says the \ndebt will be $7.486 trillion, an increase of $726 billion, not \nthe $521 billion that the administration has been talking \nabout, but $200 billion more. The big part of the difference \nobviously is Social Security, but all of that money is owed. \nThey are our creditors. We are borrowing, under the President's \nbudget from Social Security.\n    The next year the debt goes up by $647 billion. The next \nyear by $593 billion, the fourth year by $592 billion. In 2008 \nit starts to go up some more, $613 billion, and in the fifth \nyear from 2004, the debt is going up $633 billion. I do not see \nthis growth of the debt being cut in half anywhere, do you?\n    Secretary Snow. Well, the deficit is cut in half under our \nnumbers, and pretty much the CBO numbers."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    But the deficit, that is where we have this \nconfusion. The deficit, you are talking about on a unified \nbasis, when you put all the money in the same pot, trust fund \nmoney and regular money, and the problem with that is, I think \nthat fundamentally misleads us as to the magnitude of the \nproblem.\n    Secretary Snow. Senator, it also----"
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Do we not owe the money back to Social \nSecurity?\n    Secretary Snow. Senator, it also though, as you and I have \ndiscussed on prior occasions, calls attention to the things \nthat we really have to get focused on. You mentioned Social \nSecurity and Medicare. That is really what that chart says. We \nhave to get focused on these large commitments we have made to \nthe future."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Mr. Secretary, the problem I have, when the \nPresident goes out and tells the American people he is going to \ncut the deficit in half, I think that gives them comfort. I \nthink that leads them to conclude that we are getting this \nthing under control. We are not getting it under control. Under \nthe President's plan, the debt is going up. In no year is it \ngoing up less than $600 billion.\n    Secretary Snow. Senator, I would hope that that chart and \nwhat it shows on debt will lead to furtherance of this large \npublic discussion on the subject of Social Security and \nMedicare. I think we need to deal with Social Security first, \nin my view. The President has put it on the table with his call \nfor the Commission, with his call for the personal accounts, \ntried to engender a broad national dialog. I think we are \ngetting more and more attention to it. I commend you for \nbringing the fundamental longer term issue to our attention. It \nneeds to be addressed."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    The thing that I do not hear you talking \nabout is the revenue side of the equation, and here we are, we \nhave this addition to the debt every year, massive increases, \nand that is before the baby-boomers retire, that is before the \nfull effect of the President's tax cuts which make this \nsituation pale by comparison to what is going to happen.\n    So I would say this to you, maybe we can make a deal here. \nI am willing to talk about the long-term entitlement \nimbalances, but I would hope you are willing to talk about the \nlong-term imbalances on the revenue side, because deficits are \na product of the difference between spending and revenue, and \njust to talk about spending misses half the equation.\n    Secretary Snow. Senator, thank you.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Conrad, thank you very much.\n    Mr. Secretary, so you know, Senator Conrad and I already \nplan, probably after we finish the budget cycle, on having \nhearings on some of the long-term obligations that our country \nis facing, Medicare and Medicaid being the two of the largest. \nIncidentally, the unfunded liabilities that are facing Medicare \nare about three times that of Social Security. But we plan on \nhaving hearings on those and trying to maybe set the stage on \nwhat can and could and should be done in the long term to help \nmake those programs more affordable. He and I have little \ndifference of opinion on whether you should focus on gross debt \nor debt held by the public, but that is a debate for another \nday. Also we will get into--I do not know if it will be at the \nsame hearing or another, a discussion about trust funds. So we \nwill need your participation on those, maybe both for \neducational purposes.\n    I want to compliment you on your hearing performance today. \nYou were very educational, very forthright, very helpful to us \nin helping us maybe meet some of these challenges, find some of \nthe problems, solve some of the problems, and I would encourage \nMr. Manciw to listen to your presentation on employment \nstatistics. I think that would be helpful. I compliment you and \nyour outstanding staff. Thank you very much for your \nparticipation.\n    Secretary Snow. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.\n    Senator Conrad, thank you.\n    Chairman Nickles. The meeting is adjourned."

break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Chairman Nickles. Mr. Secretary, I would like to welcome \nyou to our committee. We are delighted to have the Secretary of \nHomeland Security, Tom Ridge, before us today. I believe this \nis your first appearance before our Budget Committee, so we \nwelcome you. I apologize for being a minute or two late. I went \nup to the sixth floor out of habit, but anyway I am delighted \nto have you before us.\n    Mr. Secretary, you have enormous responsibility, and I \ncompliment the President for selecting you. I compliment your \nwillingness to serve our country in this very important task of \nbeing Secretary of Homeland Security.\n    Since the year 2001, the Congress and the President \nincreased discretionary appropriations for homeland security \nfrom basically $10 billion in 2001 to the President's request \nof $30 billion for 2005. We have created a new Department of \nHomeland Security in which you, as Secretary, oversee a total \nbudget of over $40 billion, which include mandatory spending \nand fee-funded programs.\n    As you know, Mr. Secretary, creating new agencies and new \nappropriations subcommittees can be challenging for budgeteers. \nWe like to compare spending levels from year-to-year, and when \nyou start moving around the pieces, it can get very confusing. \nI want to make sure, since we have thrown in a lot of new \nmoney, that we are spending the money wisely. I have seen some \nreports where that is not the case in some areas.\n    I am concerned that Congress is creating programs under the \nbanner of Homeland Security which, in some cases, some cities, \nsome States are using as more or less general revenue sharing. \nI do not think we can afford that. I do not think we can afford \nto, frankly, rehabilitate fire departments throughout the \ncountry, and I do not think that is the purpose of your \ndepartment.\n    So we look forward the your discussion with us today. I \nthink it is vitally important for us, as members of this \ncommittee and Members of Congress, to use adequate and I would \nsay good oversight to make sure these funds are well-spent. And \nI intend to do that, and I look forward to working with all \nmembers of the committee.\n    The President requests today a large increase for your \ndomain--a 10-percent increase. When we look at most of the \nFederal budget, it is pretty close to a freeze, that is very \nsignificant. I think you have to compete with all other \npriority programs, and there will be enormous competition. As \nwe really try to be more frugal in this era of high deficits, \nyou are going to have to justify that $3-billion increase and \nconvince me, and I think other members, that it should go to \nyour department instead of to other departments.\n    And so anyway we are delighted to have you with us today.\n    First, I will call upon my friend and colleague, Senator \nConrad."

"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome, Mr. \nSecretary, to the Budget Committee.\n    I want to, first of all, commend the chairman for holding \nthis hearing. We discussed a schedule of hearings, and we \nagreed that one of the most important hearings we could have \nwould be on homeland security because, as the chairman has \nnoted, the spending has increased dramatically, certainly the \nthreat has increased dramatically, and much of that spending is \nin response to that threat. We all recognize that, and we \nsupport as strong a homeland security as we can provide.\n    On the other hand, as the chairman mentioned, we have a \nresponsibility to make certain that taxpayer funds are used \nwisely, and well, and for the purposes intended. And I must say \nI have been increasingly concerned about reports that I have \nheard from individual departments that spending initiatives \nthat were pending previously, that were not approved once they \nwere given the label of homeland security, whether or not they \nreally fit that description, sailed through.\n    And we have an obligation, as do you, to make certain that \nthings do not just sail through because a label has been put on \nthem, that they really strengthen our homeland security. And I \nknow that has got to be an extraordinary challenge to you, \nbringing together all of these different agencies and several \nhundred thousand employees or approaching several hundred \nthousand employees to try to make certain the money is used \nwisely and well.\n    Let me just go to put in perspective some of the issues \nthat I see with respect to the issue before us.\n    First is to kind of put in context where we are. This \ncommittee, and the administration, and our colleagues in the \nrest of the Congress are faced with deficits that are at record \nlevels--$521 billion. I believe at the end of this year it will \nactually be somewhat less than that, but nonetheless, a record \nbudget deficit, by far the biggest we have ever had.\n    In looking ahead, the President has said he is going to cut \nthe deficit in half. I do not see that. I do not see that under \nthe President's plan. The only way that is achieved is by \nleaving out things. But when you add back the defense cost, \nwhen you add back addressing the alternative minimum tax, which \nthe President's budget only does for 1 year, when you add back \nthe extension of the tax cuts, what I see on an operating basis \ngoing forward is extremely large deficits, by far the biggest \nwe have ever had, and all of it at the worst-possible time, \nright before the baby boomers retire.\n    One of the big problems we have is on the revenue side of \nthe equation. We have to be tough on the spending side. We also \nhave to look at the revenue side of the equation because the \nrevenue for this next year, the year we are in, is projected to \nbe the lowest as a percentage of gross domestic product since \n1950.\n    When I look at the long-term or at least the 5-year trend \non homeland security, it matches what the chairman indicated--\n$9.4 billion in 2001 and going up to $28.1 billion for 2005. So \nwe have seen a dramatic ramp-up. All of us understand why.\n    In terms of this year, the budget year 2005, the \nadministration has called for a 10-percent increase, but I have \ntried to analyze that 10 percent, and what I see leads me to a \nsomewhat different conclusion because much of that is Bio \nShield advance funding for future years--2006 or 2008. When I \ntake that out, I see about a 4-percent increase, just to put in \nperspective what I think an appropriate analysis would be.\n    And then when I look at the specifics, one thing that \nstrikes me are cuts in these areas: State formula grants for \nfirst responders, the firefighter grants, the urban area \nsecurity. In those areas, $990 million cut in State formula \ngrants, almost $250 million in firefighter grants, and then an \narea not under your direct control, over at the Justice \nDepartment, the COPS program and other law enforcement grants, \n$911 million, for a cut of a $1.4 billion, approaching $1.5 \nbillion."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    And then I look at the cost of the Bush tax cut in 2005 for \nthose earning over $337,000 a year, and the cost for the tax \ncuts for people earning over $337,000 a year in 2005 is $45 \nbillion--30 times the amount of the cuts for first responders \nand for cops on the street. I know there are some who do not \nthink of cops on the streets as first responders, but I can \ntell you my cops feel that way. And dramatic cuts in the COPS \nprogram are certainly not well-received in my constituency.\n    Finally, on the issue of port security, those grants being \ncut by 63 percent, and those are issues I want to go into in \nsome more detail when we get to the questioning phase, Mr. \nSecretary. I hope this information is useful as we go into this \nquestioning phase.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Chairman Nickles. Mr. Secretary, welcome to the committee. \nYou are free to make any opening remarks you wish."

break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Secretary Ridge. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Senator \nConrad. You have been very kind to accommodate a scheduling \nconflict I had later on this morning. So, in order to give the \nmembership of the committee the complete opportunity to address \nwhatever questions they have, I would like to just ask \nunanimous consent that the statement be included in part of the \nrecord and get at it.\n    Chairman Nickles. Certainly.\n    Mr. Secretary, Senator Conrad alluded to the fact, and \nSenator Collins has already written a letter, that dealt with \nthe reduction in the program, the State Homeland Security Grant \nprogram from $1.7 billion to $700 million. Would you care to \nexpand upon that?\n    Secretary Ridge. Yes, I would.\n    First of all, the President's budget reflects the same \nlevel of commitment in terms of his requests in his budget, the \nbudget document of 2004. What you are talking about with regard \nto the State Homeland Security Grant program is a shifting of \nsome of those resources, a substantial amount, over $700 \nmillion into the Urban Area Security Initiative, where we feel \nthat it is appropriate to take in not only population, but \npopulation density, threat, critical infrastructure and the \nlike.\n    So, if you go back and take a look and compare it with the \n2004 numbers, the overall request for the President has been \nsustained, and increases in other parts of the homeland \nsecurity budget have been advanced. It is a shifting of \nresources because there is a shifting of priorities. I think it \nis a strategic decision, while we want to continue to support \nthe development infrastructure around the country, continue to \nsupport States and their development of their own security \nstrategies, that we shift some of those dollars where we think \nthe greatest threat and the greatest possibility of \ncatastrophic loss might be.\n    Chairman Nickles. Mr. Secretary, I happen to concur with \nthat, but let me also say I do not want to waste money in the \nbig cities either.\n    Secretary Ridge. I understand.\n    Chairman Nickles. And D.C. would be a program that one \nwould say that is a high-threat area, probably one of the \nhighest, with New York, and maybe Los Angeles and others. The \nDistrict of Columbia funded leather jackets, assessed \nenvironmental problems on property prime for development. In \nMaryland, the money was buying Prince George's county \nprosecutors an office security system; Virginia, a small \nvolunteer fire department spent $350,000 on a custom-made fire \nboat; in State and local Governments in the District, Columbia \nHospital Association had a formula that guaranteed every city \nhospital a share of an $8-million grant. That meant the \nPsychiatric Institute of Washington, a small private hospital, \nreceived money to buy security cameras for its wards.\n    I could just go on. I am just looking at a lot of money \nthat is in a big city that is going to maybe be under the \ndiscretion--see, D.C., the agency used an additional $300,000, \nthis is according to the Washington Post, and maybe they might \nbe inaccurate sometime. I do not want to say it is gospel, but \naccording to a Washington Post article, let me put it that way, \nand that was debated on November the 23rd, said that $300,000 \nwas used for a computerized car towing system, which incidently \nI learned, my daughter learned the hard way. There is a lot of \ncorruption in the D.C. car towing system--corruption. And I \nwill repeat that because I am still mad about it. But I do not \nknow that your department or the Federal taxpayers should be \nfunding that. And I could go on. There is $100,000 to go to the \nmayor's politically popular Summer Jobs program, but that does \nnot make me more secure.\n    So my point is I think you are on the right track and \nsaying taking away or reducing the amount of money for the \nState grants that is going to every State by a population \nformula, I guess, and moving it into areas that you deem--I am \nguessing with your discretion--in the urban areas that are a \nhigher threat, I happen to agree with that. But this is an \nurban area of high threat, and they waste a lot of money. And I \nam going to be just as vigilant on your $700 million under that \nurban grant program as I am on the State program. And when I \nfind that we are wasting money, I am not inclined to grant \nincreases.\n    And I just want you to know I want to be your ally, but I \ncan also be your enemy if I find out that these funds are being \nwasted. And a lot of these funds, it looked like we Congress \nrushed to throw money at it, and the cities were all lobbying. \nThey are here this week. The League of Cities and the Governors \nare all out saying, give us more money, we want more money, and \nthen when you find out they are spending it in ways to buy \nleather jackets and so on, it infuriates me, and I wanted you \nto be aware of that.\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, I do not think we would ever have \nany disagreement about the need to make sure that for every \ndollar that we are investing in security, we should get at \nleast a dollar's worth of return in security. Clearly, some of \nthe expenditures that you have highlighted are of questionable \nrelationship to that outcome.\n    I will tell you, this year, for the first year, because we \nhave only been in operation for a year as of Monday, we have \nasked the States to submit homeland security plans built from \nthe grassroots up. We have also asked, with the Urban Area \nSecurity Initiative, that we get more complete prior expression \nof where those dollars are going so that as a formal function \nof our Department, we can start, one, limiting where these \ndollars can be expended, as we have a responsibility for \nbuilding that national infrastructure across the country.\n    So I am not going to try to explain how relevant some of \nthose expenditures are to homeland security because I do not \nthink I can. But I can tell you that there is not only a shared \nresponsibility for us to oversee where those dollars go, but \nthere is also a shared accountability and not just at the \nFederal level, but also at the State and local level to ensure \nthat the dollars are being spent as Congress intended. And I \nassure you we will followup on that as rigorously as we \npossibly can.\n    This year, for the first year, we will have plans. We are \nalready screening the statewide plans. And while we do not want \nto be prescriptive, because one size does not fit all, we do \nwant to frame where these dollars can go so we have a much \nbetter understanding of the integrated nature of the mutual aid \nsystems that we are trying to build around the country.\n    Chairman Nickles. Well, these funds, correct me if I am \nwrong, these funds really are not supposed to be just a subsidy \nfor local police and fire; is that correct?\n    Secretary Ridge. That is correct.\n    Chairman Nickles. Because I think a lot of cities have \nfinancial problems or challenges, and they would love to have \nus help them out, whether it is for assets or whether it is for \nother little things that are in the----\n    Congress has not abided by the President's request in the \npast. In other words, we funded part of this. I believe you \nwanted most of the first responders' money to go through FEMA \nand your department now. In the past, Congress had $1.6 billion \nof unrequested funding that was in the Department of Justice; \nis that correct? To make sure I am kind of on the right page.\n    Secretary Ridge. Well, what we hope to do, Senator, is \nactually take the programs that had been, some of the programs \nthat had been at FEMA. The basic source of these dollars were \nthe Office of Domestic Preparedness. It used to be in Justice. \nWe have it, and we want to combine our Office of Domestic \nPreparedness and our State and local office and then bring the \nrelevant grants in from FEMA and from TSA so we can develop a \none-stop shop for the State and locals, so we can better \nintegrate the use of these resources, so we have much more \nrigorous oversight, and so we can evaluate whether or not we \nare getting a security return on those investments.\n    Secretary Ridge. For our purposes though, we need to \ncombine those funds together to get your budget.\n    One other thing, and that deals with the issue of the--\nwell, maybe I will take it up later. I am going to ask all of \nour colleagues, the Secretary has a meeting, and he needs to \nleave. So I am going to try and be short, and I will ask all of \nour colleagues to try and keep their comments or questions to \nabout 7 minutes, and I think we can get there--7 or 8 minutes, \nand we should be fine.\n    So, with that, I will turn it over to Senator Conrad."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Let me just pursue, if I could, some of the items that the \nchairman was mentioning because I think this really does \ndeserve scrutiny and your opportunity for response.\n    In the article that the chairman was referencing, it \nindicates that ``Two years after Congress approved a massive \ninfusion of cash to help gird the Washington area against \nterrorism, much of the $324 million remains unspent or is \nfunding projects with questionable connections to homeland \nsecurity.'' That is on the negative side of the ledger.\n    On the positive they say, ``Police, firefighters and public \nhealth have undergone disaster training, are better equipped to \nhandle conventional attacks, weapons of mass destruction. They \nhave more gear to protect them, more ambulances and fire \ntrucks, more heavy equipment to diffuse bombs or locate victims \nburied beneath rubble. Local governments have at their disposal \nnew blueprints on how to respond to a terrorist attack.'' All \nof these things are very positive I think we would all agree.\n    But they say, on the other hand, ``Some police officers are \nstill waiting for basic protective gear. Public health labs, \nswamped by the anthrax attacks of 2001, have no more capacity \ntoday. Most local Governments have no efficient way to give \ninstructions to residents shut off from radio and television, \nand there is no comprehensive plan to unite families separated \nin a disaster.''\n    Can we just take that paragraph, Mr. Secretary, and give \nyou a chance to respond to that. Obviously, Washington, D.C., \nand you have talked about moving funds around to deal with the \npriority threat areas, and I think all of us would say that \nshould be done. But here they are saying Washington, it has \nalready been subjected to attack or the area, that some police \nofficers are still waiting for basic protective gear. What can \nyou tell us about that?\n    Secretary Ridge. The only thing I believe I could share \nwith you is that among the priorities that the city of \nWashington set was obviously the purchase of some protective \ngear, as well as other emergency equipment during the first \nyear of the funding. We are finding that throughout not only \nWashington, D.C., Senator, but around the country, that these \nGovernors, and police chiefs, and fire chiefs understand that \nthey are not going to be able to build themselves the kind of \nsecurity unit or acquire new uniforms across the board and new \nequipment across the board, and so they are incrementally and \nsequentially making different purchases to buildup over a \nperiod of years the kind of capacity that they need.\n    It reflects a decision by the mayor and the police chief as \nto what their priorities were. So, if they purchased some \nprotective gear and other needs, we are not going to quarrel \nwith that. We are just going to be mindful of their building up \nan adequate amount of protective gear and equipment over a \nperiod of time, and they are not going to be able to do this in \na year."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Do you believe that it is adequate in the \nDistrict?\n    Secretary Ridge. Well, again, I think the--I cannot tell \nyou specifically the kind of protective gear that any \nparticular police department has purchased. I can tell you that \nmany of them have initially gone to protective gear and \ncommunications equipment, but I doubt if any of them have \npurchased the protective gear for everyone in their police \nforces. It is going to take some time, and the question becomes \nwhether or not every individual police officer in every single \npolice department has to have the same kind of protective gear. \nI do not believe that is necessary."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Let me just, if I could, Mr. Chairman, \nmaybe I could ask that I just--I will give you a series of \nquestions now, and if you could provide answers in writing, so \nthat we not take the full time of the committee.\n    My No. 1 question would be do the police in Washington, \nD.C., and surrounding communities have the protective gear that \nthey need? No. 1.\n    No. 2, do they have a system of communications that allows \nthem to communicate an interoperable way? I held a hearing on \nthis out in my home State, Mr. Chairman, and that was the No. 1 \nissue of first responders is a lack of interoperable \ncommunications.\n    Third question, do the public health labs have sufficient \ncapacity to deal with a bio or chemical attack?\n    Next question, do local Governments, in the high-target \nareas, have an efficient way to give instructions to residents \nshut off from radio and television, such as a reverse 9/11 \nsystem? And maybe, Mr. Secretary, you could address that one \nright now before the committee.\n    To your knowledge, do these local Governments, in these \nhigh-vulnerability areas, have a way to give instructions to \nresidents shut off from radio and television?\n    Secretary Ridge. I believe that the National Capital \nRegion, which is a specific entity that you created in the \nlegislation that created the Homeland Security Department, has \nworked to have that kind of system put in place."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Is it in place?\n    Secretary Ridge. Well, they are certainly working on it. I \nbelieve that Mayor Williams discussed it publicly. Arlington \nCounty has a similar system. So I think, again, I cannot tell \nyou today that it is completely in place across the National \nCapital Region. I can tell you it is a priority of the National \nCapital Region, and they have been working on it vigorously \nsince the NCR was created."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Can I just ask that you, for the record, \nlet us know what is the status. You know, the one thing that \nreally struck me on that fateful day was the lack of \ncommunications. I mean here in Congress there was no \ncommunications. I think we saw that there really is a lack of a \nplan. I do not hold you responsible for that. I am just saying \nthat is the reality that I saw play out on that day and massive \nconfusion in this city. I mean, people were at jobs, did not \nknow where their loved ones were. There was no ability to talk \non a cell phone because the cell phone systems were \noverwhelmed.\n    Finally, this article asserts there is no comprehensive \nplan to unite families separated in a disaster. To your \nknowledge, is that still the case that there is no \ncomprehensive plan to unite families in the case of a disaster?\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, this raises the question of \nresponsibility of Government, and communities and families to \ndo some certain things together. There is plenty of information \nout there about the need to have a communication plan and a \ncontingency plan. There are individual efforts that have been \nundertaken by the National Capital Region to get families to \nthink of how they would contact one another and then reassemble \nin the case of an incident.\n    I know the National Capital Region is going to expand \nnearly $5 million that the Congress has appropriated. So they \nhave this massive public education effort to alert families \nthat they need to develop these individual plans themselves--\nvery family specific plans.\n    I do not think it would be possible for any level of \nGovernment to design a family specific plan. That is something \nthat they need to do themselves, but I do know that the \nNational Capital Region is putting quite a bit of energy and \nquite a few dollars that Congress appropriated toward that end."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    If you could give us a report on what the \nstatus of that is.\n    Secretary Ridge. Yes, sir."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Conrad, thank you very much.\n    I next call upon Senator Gregg. For the information of our \ncolleagues, the vote has started. We will continue throughout. \nWe will continue with the hearing.\n    Senator Gregg.\nme join with yourself and with Senator Conrad, and I think the \nquestions that Senator Conrad asked and that you asked, Mr. \nChairman, are very appropriate, and I know the Department will \nwant to answer them.\n    Actually, to some extent, there is a certain deja vu all \nover again because I have gone through these hearings now, \nsince I had jurisdiction of the issue of first responders for a \nnumber of years in my appropriations committee, and since we \ntried to set up a one-stop-shop attempt. Unfortunately, due to \nthe bureaucracy involved, we were never able to put up one-\nstop-shop. And I hope now that was the concept of the Homeland \nSecurity Department, that we would accomplish that. I \nappreciate the Secretary pursuing that course, and I am sure it \nwill be accomplished now that we have a central area.\n    And the issue of first responders, since basically this was \na program created by myself and Senator Hollings, was never to \nreplace or give the police officers, and fire departments, and \nhealth people basically replacement parts. It is not a ``blue \nlight'' program. It is not supposed to be like the LEA was in \nthe seventies. It is supposed to be a threat-based \norganization. It grew out, as I have mentioned before, from the \noriginal Nunn-Domenici Act, which targeted the top 162 cities \nin the country, and it was supposed to bring those cities up-\nto-speed, and we decided to try to take it beyond that.\n    I congratulate the Department for going to a threat-based \nsystem, and I understand that you are reorienting dollars to \naccomplish that. It is the right approach. It is going to make \na lot of chiefs, fire chiefs, police chiefs, and Governors and \nmayors unhappy, but they have to understand that if they have a \nregion that is not a high-priority threat, then they are just \nnot going to get as much money as regions that do.\n    Second, the State plan. We had an understanding there would \nbe State plans in place before we gave out any of this money, \nand that was a precondition. I know you are now redeveloping \nthe State plan, but again that is a little bit of deja vu all \nover again. But those State plans are critical to being sure \nthat this money is not ending up buying blue lights, that it is \ngoing--and so I hope you will oversight those aggressively.\n    I want to congratulate the Department for some things that \nit has done. One of the reasons I wanted the Department created \nwas because, again, I had oversight over Immigration, but I did \nnot have oversight over Customs, and I had oversight over \nBorder Patrol, but I did not have oversight over Coast Guard, \nand I found that it was just chaos trying to get these \ndepartments to communicate with each other.\n    I have spent a lot of time since the Department has been up \nand running talking to the line folks, the Customs agents, the \nImmigration folks and asked them, ``Well, how is it working? \nAre you guys talking to each other yet?'' And initially there \nwas a lot of resistance. There was a sense of, ``I do not want \nto learn that guy's job, and he is never going to do my job as \nwell as I can do it.''\n    That has changed. That whole atmosphere has changed out \nthere. There is a real positive atmosphere from the \nImmigration, the Customs people, the Border Patrol people. I \nsense a real dedication to trying to learn each other's job, \nmaking this integrated. It is anecdotal to me, but it is good \nnews, and I congratulate the Department for the effort there.\n    What I want to ask is this Bio Shield issue. As Senator \nConrad pointed out, most of this money is going to prefund Bio \nShield, most of the new money. I am very concerned we are not \nmaking progress on this, that we are open to a biological and \nchemical attack. We have not been able to pass the Bio Shield \nbill out of the Senate. I got it out of our committee a long \ntime ago. It should have been through the Senate. It should \nhave been passed. It should have been down to you.\n    How much do you need the Bio Shield authorization to do \nthis right, and even though you have not gotten the \nauthorization, are you able to use the dollars to get us \noriented for the purposes of first detecting and then handling \nbiological and chemical attacks, which is clearly our biggest \nthreat?\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, as one who spent 12 years on \nauthorization committees but never managed to get to an \nappropriation committee, I do not want to say that not having \nthe appropriation would impair our ability to restrict our \nability to use those dollars. I will let the Congress work that \nout.\n    We are comfortable that the $2 billion-plus that you have \nprovided us can be used under the circumstances designed by the \nlegislation. That is, if we see that there is a specific \nthreat, a biological threat, for which we do not have an \nantidote or a vaccine, and we know very clearly that there is \nnot going to be a commercial market for this product, you have \ngiven us the resources to go in immediately and engage the \nprivate sector in researching the antidote or the vaccine.\n    So, again, we will let the Congress work their will on \nwhether or not we are going to get an authorization bill, but \nwe believe that the appropriation gives us the opportunity to \nuse those funds immediately when we do.\n    Senator Gregg. On another issue, I was a little concerned \nabout the Department's request in the area of TOPOFF. It seems \nto me that TOPOFF has been an extremely constructive \nexperience. It has now really gotten very mature."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Could the Senator explain what that is.\n    Senator Gregg. TOPOFF is basically exercises of attacks, \ngoing through what is basically a military exercise. We stage a \nsimulated attack on a city. It is biological, chemical or \nconventional or maybe even nuclear, and then it is a full \nscale, engage everybody in the community in a time line, very \ncomplicated, but very professionally done, much the way the \nStrategic Air Command used to stage their exercises relative to \nwar.\n    But I am a little concerned that the funding does not \nappear to be as aggressive as it needs to be in this area in \norder to stand up the next round of TOPOFF exercises.\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, we think you have given us the \nresources to do that. I am actually going to have a briefing \nhere in the next couple of days as we prepare for TOPOFF 3. \nSenator Conrad, the last TOPOFF 2 exercise included \nsimultaneous events. One was a radiological event in Seattle, \nthe other was a biological event in Chicago. When you bring to \nbear the Federal, State and local resources and all of the \nprime time players, we actually even had a, we call it VNN, a \nVirtual News Network, so we could work on crisis communication \nduring this period. You learn a lot. You learn what you are \ndoing right. You find gaps in the system, and you learn where \nyou need to strengthen.\n    Senator Gregg. What we learned was that the mayor of \nSeattle was a lot more efficient than the Federal Government in \nresponding.\n    Secretary Ridge. They did a good job, Senator. They did a \ngood job."
break,break,break,break
"","","","","    [Laughter.]\n    Secretary Ridge. So there are a lot of lessons to learn, \nboth good and bad, and I think the Congress has been very \ngenerous with funding in that regard. Plus, not only the broad \nnational exercises, but we literally run hundreds of both \nformal, on-the-ground, boots-on-the-ground exercises or table-\ntop exercises. That is one of the primary responsibilities of \nthe Office of Domestic Preparedness, and one of the eligible \ncosts associated with the dollars that Congress appropriates to \nour department.\n    Senator Gregg. Senator Corzine?"
"corzine","Senator Corzine","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Welcome Governor, and let me start with a \ncompliment based on my reading of how the Department is working \nwith the folks in my home State, and I feel like there is good \ndialog and coordination. That is the good news. Let me ask \nsome----\n    Senator Gregg. Senator Corzine, could I note that I am \ngoing to have to leave to go vote. Could you recess the meeting \nafter you finish and the other folks will be coming back?\nhappy to recess.\n    I am going to ask a couple of questions: one about chemical \nplant security, one about screening issues at airports, and \nthen a little bit about port security and do that relatively \nquickly.\n    Chemical plant security is a major issue in my State. We \nhave a number of plants that have more than a million folks \nthat are in the fall-out zone of a potential explosion, and it \nis an issue that you have actually spoke very, I thought, \neloquently about, talking about voluntary efforts that alone \nare not sufficient in a letter that you sent to the Washington \nPost, October 6, 2002.\n    Do you feel the legislation that is working its way through \nCongress, which does not bring about mandatory review of \nsecurity plans and review of technological elements of chemical \nplants is adequate to meet a standard of certainty for the \ncommunities that surround these plants?\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, first of all, I would hope that, \nwhile there may not be mandatory review, we certainly are \nempowered to--the Department of Homeland Security is empowered \nwith its discretion to go out and review the security plans at \nany chemical site. We have worked very hard over the past year \nvisiting some of the potentially more problematic sites. Some \nof them have been in New Jersey.\n    We have produced a document dealing with the common \nvulnerabilities of chemical facilities and potential indicators \nof terrorist activity. We have established a protection, \ntraining, and planning program. We are trying to develop a \nbaseline for chemical facilities. So whatever the legislation \nmight be, I do think it is very, very important that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, particularly the \nInfrastructure Protection Unit, have the ability to go out and \nreview the security plans.\n    And likewise, I think one of the most important allies to \ndetermine whether or not that chemical site has met the local \nneeds is that we get some, that the local first responders were \nincluded in that assessment. Because actually they are going to \nbe the ones that are going to have to deal with the incident if \nit occurs.\n    So mandate--I think it is imperative that we have the \nability to go out and review the security plans."
"corzine","Senator Corzine","corzine","Senator Corzine","    I would hope that you would have some kind \nof accountability for the plans. I think that the idea that you \ncould go out is a good thing, but whether we are actually \nfollowing through, I believe, based on at least my own \nanecdotal spot checks and others and broad bases, not all of \nwhat is being said is going to be done is being done, and I \nfind it quite threatening in a community where there are \nmultiple millions in a number of the incidents in New Jersey, \nbut it is true across the country.\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, we would be prepared to work with \nyou on the language. What we have done, tried to do within \nthese chemical facilities, is take a look at again the toxicity \nof the contents, proximity to population, and we have begun to \nset some priorities. And I think that clearly we will never \nhave enough manpower to get out and visit and work with every \nchemical site around the country. We are going to have to rely \non our first responders and the local law enforcement community \nto do that, but there are some that would offer great potential \ncatastrophic consequences, and I would like to work with you on \nthe language and make sure we get out and review those."
"corzine","Senator Corzine","corzine","Senator Corzine","    As you have I think appropriately \nidentified threat-based elements with how you are designating \nyour priorities in the Department, I think that is true here, \nand we need a prioritization basis on how you look at these.\n    I think some of the things that I see coming through \nCongress not necessarily meeting the themes or the standards \nthat I think I hear, and I have heard from you as you have \ncommented on this, and I recognize that you recognize it is an \nimportant element. I see it working on the ground through our \nState efforts, but I would encourage you and the administration \nto do whatever you can to get a bill through with some \nmeaningful bite with regard to prioritization and then mandates \nat least with regard to some of those issues, and I look \nforward to working with you.\n    Let me ask about the state of screening by a TSA at \nairports. I am quite obviously being parochial in one sense in \nthat Newark airport is one of the seven airports that did not \nmeet the baggage screening deadline at the 1st of the year. I \nthink there were seven.\n    A lot of this is attributed, at least from the interviews \nthat I have been able to put together with the folks on the \nground, this is a heavy turnover in TSA and among screeners. I \nthink average is 14 percent. I think it is 17 percent in \nNewark, and it goes up to 35 or 36 percent. By any managerial \nmetric, those are high turnover rates and do not lead to the \nbest of professionalism and efforts in carrying through.\n    Is this a problem that is being recognized? Are there plans \nto address it? And particularly how soon do we think that these \nseven airports--I happen to have a special interest in Newark--\nthat we can get this into a position that we can begin to give \nthe public assurance that the safety of the airways is intact?\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, I would like permission to get \nback to you specifically with a request to our anticipated \ndeadline for the Newark airport and for those seven. I do not \nhave that information with me, but I would be pleased to work \nback to you.\n    Yes, we have experienced similar problems at some of the \nother airports, Senator. A lot of it has to do with \nconvenience, transportation, getting to the airports, the cost \nof either the inconvenience associated with taking public \ntransportation--many of them have to--the cost of parking their \nvehicles. There are certain themes that we are seeing in some \nof our major airports around the country that we are going to \ntry to address financially with different kinds of incentives \nto keep people working.\n    We invest a great deal in them to train, but if we have \nthis constant turnover, it is not, to your point, it does not \nprovide the stability and the continuity we need. So we are \naware of the challenge. A lot of it has to do I think with \naccess, transportation, and we are reviewing a system of \nfinancial incentives to help alleviate some of the problems \nthat these people are running into in order to get out there to \nserve the public."
"corzine","Senator Corzine","corzine","Senator Corzine","    I think there are real issues here I the \noverall structure, and any time you start a new program as \nbroad as this is, that it can be the kinds of issues you cite. \nIt does not happen to be the case at Newark because there is \ngreat public transportation there. It is a huge turnover.\n    I would love to work with you on the specifics in that \nparticular situation, but I think it is a national problem. And \nI will just ask for the record, since I need to go vote, on \nport security, I am curious what current percentage of \ncontainers that we are actually screening, if that is something \nthat is available for the public view, and is there a metric of \nresources expended to increase the number, and is there a goal \nwhere we think we can, since you probably can't screen every \nsingle container that ever comes to the shores, how can we get \nourselves into a position to have the greatest confidence on \nour screening abilities? What is the percentage? Where do we \nstand with regard to our budget requirements to get to that?\n    And since I have to go vote, I will take that on----\n    Secretary Ridge. I would be pleased to, Senator. Just to \nassure you that we are layering in our review, our inspection \nof these container ships, beginning with a very precise \ntargeting of these containers before they are unloaded in \nSingapore, and Hong Kong and the like. It is a rule-based \nsystem. We do it at the National Targeting Center here, and \nright now I think we are at 98 or 99 percent of the containers \ninitially go through that process before they are even put on \nthe ship. It is a very important and very complex application \nof the information we have acquired from the Coast Guard and \nthe Customs over the years, and I would be very pleased to lay \nout in detail to you the different layers of defense as it \nrelates to cargo container security.\n    Sorry to keep you, Senator. Thank you.\nvery much. That was an excellent question.\n    Senator Burns.\n    Senator Burns. Thank you very much.\n    I have just a couple of points. You might want to write \nthese down, and you may have to respond to them, Mr. Secretary, \nin private or whatever.\n    I notice you have in here an increase of about $892 million \nor a 20-percent increase in improving aviation security. Could \nyou tell me is that employees? Is that a capital investment? \nWhere is that money going? Because every time I go down there, \nI have never seen so damn many people in my life. They are all \nover the place, and I am not real sure we need it.\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, that additional $800 million is \nbasically personnel costs. The 2004 budget, as we ramped up \npursuant to the mandates from Congress, we did not need, \nbecause we were not fully ramped up--let me put it another way. \nWe had an FTE requirement that was not fully met in 2004, and \nwe needed additional dollars to meet it in 2005. So those are \npersonnel costs, to your point, paying for labor, and paying \nfor the baggage and passenger screeners.\n    You should also know simultaneously we are now going back, \nhaving met the mandate of Congress, getting the technology \ndeployed, hiring the screeners, on an airport-by-airport basis \nto see if the present configuration of people and technology is \nappropriate at each and every airport. So there will be some \nadjustments in the future. Some airports may have fewer, some \nairports may have more screeners. But we really need now to \ntake a look an airport-by-airport basis to determine whether or \nnot we have the right number of people there. And the more \ntechnology we can deploy, in the long term, probably the fewer \npeople we will need.\n    Senator Burns. Passenger IDs, any of these people on people \nwho have a record of being frequent flyers, are they going to \nidentify those people in some way or another, facilitate moving \nsome of those people through these airports a lot quicker?\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, as you know, we are working on \ntwo initiatives right now within the Department. One is the \ncomputer-assisted passenger prescreening program. It is a pilot \nprogram that we hope, with the approval of Congress and \nbasically we need the stamp of approval from GAO, that we can \nrun that program. It would help us prescreen and probably \neliminate a substantial of the secondary screening.\n    There is another initiative that we are looking at called a \nTrusted Traveler Program, where people are prepared to give us, \nin advance, basic information about themselves, and so we can \nconfirm their identity, verify who they are, and they do what \nthey claim they do, to expedite their movement through the \nairport as well.\n    So those two initiatives we are undertaking this year.\n    Senator Burns. In another area. Up in our State, when those \ngrants come down to help first responders, fire departments, \nthis type thing, there was a, if your EMTs or your first \nresponders was not a part of the fire department, they did not \nget any funds. Is that a rule in your shop or is that a local \nState regulation?\n    Secretary Ridge. I think that is a restriction--I would \nhave to double check, Senator--but I believe that is a \nrestriction imposed by legislation. If it is the Assistant to \nFirefighters Grant program, I think it limits access to those \ndollars to firefighters.\n    Clearly, the emergency management personnel that you are \ntalking about, if they are part of a State or local scheme, can \nqualify for any money. But for the Assistance to the \nFirefighters Grant, I believe Congress limited that just to \nfire departments.\n    Senator Burns. You have different situations, like in the \nState of Montana, we have such small towns, you know, sometimes \nthey are not together, and most times they are volunteer \nsystems in that respect.\n    One other question. In the area of bio defense, we have \nspent a lot of money in the procurement of vaccines and drugs \nthat would be needed in case of a bio attack. Do those drugs \nhave shelf lives, and what is our cost of replenishing those or \nturning those over from time to time?\n    Secretary Ridge. The drugs do have a shelf life. Health and \nHuman Services, one of their responsibilities over the \nstrategic national stockpile is to monitor and replace them if \nthey have exceeded their shelf life. I cannot give you the \nspecific annual figure to replace the vaccines or the other \npharmaceuticals, but I will get it for you.\n    Senator Burns. And border, I understand we are going to \nrestock a whole little town in Montana about people coming to \nMontana or that is going to work that border. I do have a \ncomplaint, though, and I hear this more than anything else.\n    As you know, bureaucracies have habits of building \nfiefdoms, and we are getting a lot of complaints on just out \nand out harassment at these borders. And I know most, I should \nprobably take that up with department heads, and I plan to do \nthat, but I did want to bring it up during this hearing because \nI am concerned about that.\n    The free flow, Mr. Secretary, is this. We have people who \nfarm both sides of that border up there. They have farms in \nCanada, they have farms in the United States, and now all at \nonce we are just--really, it is just a hassle to traverse that \nborder now, where it has always been open before, and these are \npeople that are everyday people, and most of them live in the \narea. But they say these people are just getting out of hand, \nand they are outrageous, and they are discourteous, and if you \nmake them mad, they will leave your equipment sitting there. \nThey might hold you for a half a day. I heard of farmer had to \nhold his equipment half a day because he made the guy mad, and \nI fail to understand this.\n    Secretary Ridge. Well, Senator, I would like to work with \nyou on that. We have had some challenges along the borders \nbecause of that.\n    Senator Burns. I will bet you have.\n    Secretary Ridge. And our job obviously is to, No. 1 \npriority is security, but there is a commercial activity at the \nborder. Some of it is visible with trucks, and cargos, and \nothers. It is just good farmers who happen to have a parcel of \nland on both sides. So we would certainly like to work with you \non that, and I am fairly confident we can come up with a \nsatisfactory solution. You identify the problem, Senator, and \nwe will correct it.\n    Senator Burns. Thank you.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Burns, thank you very much.\n    Mr. Secretary, I told you earlier I would try to get you \nout--11:30 is when you--do you have a little flexibility there?\n    Secretary Ridge. A quarter of.\n    Chairman Nickles. We will be OK.\n    Senator Wyden? Thank you."
"wyden","Senator Wyden","corzine","Senator Corzine","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Mr. Secretary, as you and I have talked about before, I \nfeel very strongly that it is possible to fight terrorism \nwithout gutting civil liberties. Yesterday, the associated \npress ran a story that indicated that some of the remnants of \nAdmiral Poindexter's program are still continuing. I want to \nstart with a couple of questions about that.\n    My first question is can you make clear to us that none of \nthose Poindexter programs are used to spy on law-abiding \nAmericans on American soil? That is what the law requires.\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, I am going to respectfully refer \nthat inquiry to DOD, where Admiral Poindexter was engaged in \nthat enterprise. I can assure you that nothing that we are \ndoing in the Department of Homeland Security has been designed \nto collect information or to spy on American citizens. Frankly, \nevery initiative that we consider, from the outset, there is \nboth concern and consideration about the impact on civil \nliberties and privacy.\n    The Congress very appropriately created within the \nDepartment a Privacy Office and an Office of Civil Liberties, \nand those couple of really talented lawyers and very good \nstaffs are engaged at the very outset not only internally \nwithin the Department, but frankly with the groups and \norganizations around the country that legitimately are \nconcerned about the universal protection of privacy and \nfreedom."
"wyden","Senator Wyden","wyden","Senator Wyden","    Is your office involved, in any way, with \ndata mining on the part of Government agencies? Because it \nseems to me that the Congress is just in the dark with respect \nto data mining. And we are paying for it, and my guess is you \nall are involved with other agencies in data mining today. And \nI would like to know, A, if that is the case; B, how many \nprograms are going on involving data mining; and, C, how much \nmoney is being spent on data mining; and, D, whether there are \nany privacy rules with respect to how this data mining is going \nforward?\n    What can you tell us about your office and data mining this \nmorning?\n    Secretary Ridge. Well, Senator, I would like a little \nclarification from you, and I would be happy to have a private \nconversation with you, even a public exchange, if we framed the \nissue.\n    We target containers coming into the United States. We \nbuildup a data base that includes information about companies, \nand shippers, and we do refer to that. I do not know whether \nyou consider that to be part of a data-mining process, but we \ndo refer to information that we have compiled in Customs and \nthe Coast Guard about companies and shippers.\n    We do, as part of a program to move commerce through the \nborders, insist on going in to check the backgrounds of truck \ndrivers coming across our borders from Canada to Mexico in \norder to get them access, quicker access to and from the \nStates.\n    We are contemplating a computer-assisted passenger \nscreening program. This is probably perhaps where the greatest \nconcern might be, where we would take the name, the address, \nthe phone number, and the date of birth and other passenger \nname records that would be associated with that passenger. And, \nagain, the Congress has set some thresholds and asked the GAO \nto examine the CAPPS program to ensure that the privacy \nprotections that Congress is concerned about are met. We are \nstill working and developing that pilot program, which we \ncannot implement without the GAO's imprimatur.\n    So I would be happy to take up any of these or any related \nquestions with you at any time. But we are getting access to \npersonal information, and occasionally some proprietary \ninformation, but the most expansive reach would be the CAPPS \nprogram where we are trying to enhance security, reduce \ninconvenience, and frankly get access to some commercial \ninformation that commercial vendors might."
"wyden","Senator Wyden","wyden","Senator Wyden","    Why don't you furnish to me, for the record, \nwhat programs involving data mining your agency is involved \nwith because I think it is very clear that everything from \nairline ticket purchases, to visas, to driver's licenses, a \nwhole host of information is being examined by Government \nagencies every single day, and the Government, and certainly \nthe Congress, is in the dark with respect to what is going on \nin data mining. There are no privacy rules. It seems to me the \npublic has a right to know exactly what is going on here.\n    Two other questions, very briefly. Section 313 of the \nlegislastion creating the homeland security department calls \nfor the creation of the Centralized Technology Clearinghouse. \nThis is something I was very involved with. And the point of \nthe clearinghouse was to make sure that our entrepreneurs and \nour small businesses would not have to traipse all over \nWashington, D.C., in order to get their technologies reviewed. \nWe are not clear what the status is of the clearinghouse that \nis mandated by Section 313. Could you give us some sense of \nwhere that is because there are a lot of entrepreneurs and \nsmall businesses with ideas out there, and they wanted a one \nstop kind of process. What is the status of the clearinghouse?\n    Secretary Ridge. We understand and recognize it is a \npriority for the Congress. It is not as complete as I think you \nwant it to be. With regard to getting access to information \nconcerning procurement, we are in the process of streamlining \nthat. In terms of it getting access to our Science and \nTechnology Unit, to review the technology to see if it has \napplication either within the Federal Government or elsewhere. \nThose are two features of that, as I read Section 313, that you \nwanted us to do. We are not completely done with either one \nyet; one, procuring information; two, assessing whether or not \nthe technology is as good as it says it is and will perform as \nadvertised."
"wyden","Senator Wyden","wyden","Senator Wyden","    I hope that you all can move quickly on that \nbecause it seems to me that this is something we hear again and \nagain from small business people, that they traipse all over \nWashington, D.C., trying to get answers.\n    One last question, if I might. Section 224 of the law was \nsomething that I was particularly interested in because it \nestablished something called NetGuard, which was essentially \nvolunteers in science and technology. We saw after 9/11, for \nexample, a lot of companies literally went to New York City in \nan effort to try to help them get their communications link-ups \nback and going, and they simply could not get in.\n    What is the status of section 224? This is something, like \nthe clearinghouse, it is a very low-cost operation. NetGuard is \nvolunteers. This is not something with Government employees. \nWhat is the status?\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, I will have to get back to you on \nthat one."
"wyden","Senator Wyden","wyden","Senator Wyden","    Fair enough.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Wyden, thank you very much.\n    Next, is Senator Sessions.\n    Senator Sessions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Mr. Secretary, it is great to have you with us. You have \nhad one of the greatest challenges anybody could have to try to \nassimilate all of these agencies and departments into one \ncohesive branch. I think you are doing a good job, and I salute \nyou for it, but it is not easy. Anybody that has worked in the \nFederal Government, as I did, and worked with a lot of \nagencies, a United States attorney, and you know they are all \nquite different, have institutional prerogatives. When they \ndecide to work together, they sign what amounts to treaties, \nyou know, Memoranda of Understanding and things, that really I \nthink indicate just how difficult it is to get people to work \ntogether.\n    In that regard, I strongly believe, based on my experience \nat that level, partnerships between law enforcement at the \nlocal level, partnerships between State and local and Federal \nworks. I have heard some concern in the field that there is not \nenough really partnering with the Federal Government in \ncooperative work.\n    It is something, in my experience, you have to push \nconstantly from the top, and it will eventually filter down, \nbut without sustained leadership and pushing, it may not \nhappen. I know you have indicated your desire to see this \nhappen, but I wonder if you are satisfied at the level of \ncooperation and, if not, will you continue to push for that?\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, I am very satisfied with the \nlevel of cooperation We have literally seven hundred thousand-\nplus volunteers in State and local law enforcement that want to \nbe part of the Homeland Security team, and if given actionable \ninformation will take action to help us.\n    Our challenge within the Department is to build an \ninformation network so that we can give them timely \ninformation. Just yesterday, we announced an initiative. Our \ngoal is to complete it by the end of the year, and that is \nbasically to design an Internet-based information-sharing \nsystem that once completed will go through all 50 States and \ninitially to the 50 largest urban areas. But, clearly, trunk \nlines can be spun off of that, so we can pass on down to the \nStates and local law enforcement sensitive, but unclassified, \ninformation, and then as we complete our classification system, \nwhere needed, and when appropriate, even pass down secret \ninformation. It will be an Internet-based system.\n    As I said before, our goal is to get it up and operational, \nand it is also not only going to connect us vertically, but the \nOperations Center in Washington, D.C., then can compare notes \nwith the Operation Center in New York City. So there will be \npoints of comparison, where they may pick up bits and pieces of \ninformation that need to be shared. They may find some trends \nwith regard to surveillance activity and share those. So, \nagain, it is an Internet-based system. It is one of many that \nwe are going to do in addition to secure phones, and video \nconferencing and the like, but our goal is to have that \ncompletely operational by the end of this year.\n    Senator Sessions. I think that would be an historic step \nand would be very important. At the same time, I think you also \nneed to push your local officials in areas to have regular \nmeetings with the local law enforcement. Make sure they feel \nthat they know how to access this and feel that partnership \neffort.\n    Secretary Ridge. If I might, Senator, one of the things I \nfailed to note, and for everyone's benefit, this was a system \nactually designed by State and local police, and shortly after \n9/11 we became familiar with it. And it just seemed to be the \neasiest way to transmit information.\n    During the holiday season, we actually used this system to \nconnect with New York City and Los Angeles, California. So \nyou'd get virtual real-time information exchanged. We saw a \ncouple of States using it. New York and California get a lot of \ncredit. We said this should be one of the main poles in the \ninformational tent, and it was really brought to us by State \nand local law enforcement. As you point out, if we give them \ninformation, they can act on it.\n    Senator Sessions. Mr. Secretary, we have a substantial \nproblem with securing our borders with regard to immigration. \nWe have large numbers of people here illegally. I understand \nthat this bill calls for I believe $23 million for enhanced \nworksite----\n    Secretary Ridge. Enforcement.\n    Secretary Ridge. Yes, sir.\n    Senator Sessions. Are you satisfied that can make a \nsignificant difference in that problem?\n    Secretary Ridge. Well, Senator, I think it is a doubling of \nthe personnel and teams that we have within the Department. We \nwill give you a status report here in maybe 6 months to tell \nyou whether or not, after we get those dollars, and see if we \nneed additional support.\n    But I think, as a precursor to dealing with the President's \ninitiative concerning immigration, we will know that none of \nthese laws are going to be effective unless we have the \nresources to enforce them. So we do have a doubling of those \ndollars to assist us in 2005, and we think it is adequate to \nmeet our laws under the existing laws because we are doing so \nmany other things in addition to that at the borders to reduce \nthe illegal flow of immigrants.\n    Senator Sessions. Well, we are making some progress.\n    Secretary Ridge. Yes, sir, I think we are.\n    Senator Sessions. There is no doubt about that. I have been \na critic of, as you know, the legal system and its \neffectiveness in some of the things we have done. I think we \nprobably need more than that in that account.\n    And, second, you have a $100-million increase for purposes \nof dealing with detention and removal of illegals. As I \nremember the numbers, I think there are 400,000 absconders, \npeople who have been arrested for violations of immigration \nlaw, were released on bail, and they just never return. There \nare 400,000 out there. They also are not getting into the \nNational Crime Information Center.\n    I am sure this $100 million will help, but I hope that you \nwill give high priority to guaranteeing, before we have any \nreform of the law, that our legal system is capable of dealing \neffectively with these problems.\n    Would you make any comments about that expenditure and what \nyou hope to achieve with it.\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, you highlighted a challenge that \nwe have with regard to the enforcement of the law, and that is \ndealing with those who fail to show up for that final \ndetermination hearing or there is a hearing, but we have no \nplace to detain them. So the $100 million will significantly \nincrease the capacity--not completely--but it is a significant \nincrease in our detention capability, so once detained we can \nmake arrangements to deport them.\n    Senator Sessions. When people are convicted of felonies, \nthey really should not be released. They are required by law to \nbe deported, and I understand that has not been happening on a \nregular basis, and we need to make progress there.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Sessions, thank you very much, \nspoken as a Senator and also a former U.S. attorney.\n    Senator Stabenow."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","wyden","Senator Wyden","    Thank you, and welcome, Secretary Ridge, \nit is good to see you again.\n    Secretary Ridge. Hello, Senator. It is good to see you."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    I first want to thank you for coming to \nMichigan and for the progress we have made at the border. It \nhas been my pleasure to be a part of hosting you and a \nbipartisan delegation and have you come and see not only the \nchallenge in Detroit, which is the largest Northern border \ncrossing, as you know, but also in Port Huron, a smaller \ncommunity where there are multiple risks and threats, and we \nlook forward to continuing to work with you to meet those \nmultiple needs, both for small communities as well as larger \ncommunities.\n    I also understand you will be in Detroit on Friday to the \nEconomic Club, so we welcome you again.\n    Secretary Ridge. Thank you."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    There is no doubt in my mind that this is \none of the most serious issues, if not the most serious issue, \nthat we face as it relates to the budget, and this is not a \npartisan issue. We all care about safety and want to make sure \nwe are safe, but we have different choices, and that is really \nwhat the budget process is all about.\n    And one of my deep concerns is that after having 11 \ndifferent meetings around Michigan with first responders, I can \nsay emphatically that if I were to answer Senator Conrad's \nquestions about do we have protective gear, do we have \ninteroperability on communications, do we have what we need in \nmy State, the answer would be no, no, no. And that is of deep \nconcern to me.\n    And so when I look at choices in the budget, and I would \nask, first, you to respond with your former Governor hat on, as \nbeing a distinguished Governor and having to work under Federal \nlaws and budgets in the past, when we look at the fact that the \nPresident's budget cuts the COPS program by $712 million, and \nthe fire grant program by $250 million, and then provides some \nother increases, but when we look at the fact that, in totality \nfor a Governor or a local community, you do not \ncompartmentalize everything. You do not say to this police \nofficer, you will only answer the call if we know it is \nterrorism, and you will answer the call if we know that it is a \ndomestic problem.\n    The practical reality is that law enforcement has to \naddress a wide variety of issues. They get a call on a \nsuspicious package, they do not know whether or not that is \nterrorism or whether that is something else, and yet they have \nto respond.\n    So the local police chief, the mayor, the Governor looks at \nit in totality of what they need to be ready for threats no \nmatter where they come from, which is one of my concerns about \nour attempts to divide this up in some way. Where the rubber \nmeets the road, and you are dialing 911, that is just now how \nthey look at it, in a practical sense.\n    So I am concerned, I mean, as a former Governor, if you \nwere receiving a $5-million increase in homeland security, but \nthen a $5-million cut in other areas, would you feel you were \nreally moving ahead?\n    Secretary Ridge. Well, Senator, even the new math wouldn't \nget me to that conclusion if you took $5 million out of this \npot they used to give me and gave me $5 million in that pot, so \nI can understand that. But I want to share with you that I \nthink it is, at least from Homeland Security's point of view, \nthe President has sustained his commitment, which was a \nconsiderable increase in 2004. What we are talking about, \nSenator, is the difference between--and again you did say it \nwas a matter of priorities--but the President's request, by and \nlarge, for first responders this year is at 2004 request level.\n    In the budget process and in the legislative process, the \nCongress shifted some resources and took the dollar amounts for \nthe State homeland security grants a little bit higher, took \nthe assistance to the firefighters' grants higher. But I think \nwe have to be very clear. The President has basically sustained \nhis request from 2004 to 2005, and the priorities were shifted \na little bit by Congress.\n    And I think the President has come up in 2005, and here we \nhave shifted--it is the same amount--but we have shifted the \nresources to where we think strategically there would be, at \nleast for this time, it would be a better investment."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    And I appreciate that. My concern, which \nis a larger concern, really addressed--that we are responsible \nfor as well--is whether or not we are meeting 2004 levels and \nwhether it is the same as 2005. Those levels were underfunding \nof what our communities needed.\n    And the broader issue, and I have more of a statement, is \nthat when we look at what former Republican Senator Warren \nRudman and the commission, a distinguished group of people, \nlooked at in terms of the broad needs that we have on first \nresponders, they indicated that it would take $15 billion more \na year to truly make sure the equipment was there, the \ncommunications was there, the bioterrorism training was there, \nthe staff was there.\n    This is more just a comment from the perspective of our \nBudget Committee, but when we look at this next year--and I am \nborrowing Senator Conrad's chart--and we look at the fact that \nit is a matter of choices. For people who are earning over \n$337,000 a year, this next year they get $45 billion back in \ntheir pockets in terms of a tax cut. If we just gave them two-\nthirds of that, if we said we, as Americans, need to sacrifice \ntogether, and we are all going to be better off if we are able \nto fund everything that is needed in homeland security, and we \njust said you can have two-thirds of that, but we are keeping a \nthird of it to fund first responders, I believe that would be a \nbetter choice to keep us safe.\n    One other question, Mr. Secretary, and I will not ask you \nto respond to that. That is an issue for us to debate in terms \nof priorities.\n    Secretary Ridge. I understand."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    On the local front in Michigan, when you \nwere in Michigan last, we talked about a specific issue to \nMichigan which is the fact that Toronto closed all of their \nlandfills and is now trucking all of their trash literally into \nMichigan. We have a, we showed you through a helicopter, the \ntrucks coming across the bridge.\n    Secretary Ridge. Right."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    Over 180 trucks a day. Even though we \nhave better equipment at the border, and I was pleased to \nsponsor the amendment to create that and to work with folks at \nthe border who have done an excellent job, we still cannot see \ninside of every truck. Every truck is not completely inspected.\n    Your Department has initiated an effort to look at these \ntrash trucks from a security standpoint. I wonder if you can \nshare, at this point in time, any update on what you are \nfinding or when you will be able to give us some feedback on \nthat. This is a critical issue in Michigan for us and a real \nissue of national security because we do not know what is \ninside those trucks, and we are very concerned about our \nability to keep people safe.\n    Secretary Ridge. Well, Senator, No. 1, thank you for your \nhospitality during that visit. I did learn quite a bit. The \nvisit to Port Huron specifically was very eye-opening in \nrelationship to a community with massive infrastructure and not \nvery good access to any of the dollars that are out there, \nexcept through the State's share, and I look forward to working \nwith you and your colleagues to see if we can remedy that as we \nwork with the regulations around the Urban Area Security \nInitiative.\n    I did raise the issue with my counterpart in Canada, after \nour meeting, and clearly it was just the raising of the issue, \nbut no resolution. It was raised again when I returned, based \non my conversation with you, with Customs and Border Patrol. \nBut what, if anything, they have done since that time we \nvisited, I do not know, and I would be pleased to get back to \nyou and report. All right?"
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    Thank you.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Stabenow, thank you very much.\n    Before I call on Senator Allard, Mr. Secretary, I need to \nexcuse myself. Senator Crapo will conclude chairing the \nhearing. I just want to thank you for your presentation before \nour committee today, and also I look forward to working with \nyou. You have taken on a big challenge reorganizing a whole lot \nof the Federal Government. I think doing a good job, making our \ncountry safer, it is almost an impossible task, and I just \ncompliment you and your team for the work that you are doing \nand look forward to working with you in the future.\n    I apologize that I need to step out, but I think we just \nhave three or four more Senators, so you should be done \nshortly.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Allard.\n    Secretary Ridge. Thank you, Senator.\n    Senator Allard. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Mr. Secretary, welcome.\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator.\n    Senator Allard. I always enjoy what you have to say.\n    The administration, I want to move right into one, a \nquestion here that has to do with the local nature and local \nproblems that we are having in Colorado and several other \nStates first, and then I have some other questions I want to \ntalk to you a little bit about--the Information Analysis and \nInfrastructure Protection program that you have in place.\n    The administration suggested a significant funding decrease \nfor chemical demilitarization in the budget for the Department \nof Defense. We have a facility in Pueblo, Colorado, that will \nbe profoundly affected, and understanding that you are not here \ntoday representing the Department of Defense, I would just ask \nsimply does a delay in the disposal of chemical weapons and \nbyproducts, essentially warehousing these hazardous materials, \npost a risk to homeland security?\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, I would, without knowing the \nspecific details of the change reflected in the DOD's budget, I \nwould say to you that the delay, in and of itself, I do not \nnecessarily think would create a higher level of risk as long \nas there is no diminution of security around the facility. I do \nthink that one organization that has been very good over the \nyears at protecting their forest structure and everything \nassociated with him has been the Department of Defense. But \ndelay in final disposal, no, assuming that the security \nmeasures have been sustained.\n    Senator Allard. And I think that is the big ``if,'' because \nI know around the facility we have in Colorado, I am not, at \nleast the locals are not convinced, we have much in the way of \nsecurity measures, and it seems that the sooner we can get \nthis----\n    Secretary Ridge. Is it through a private contractor?\n    Senator Allard. They are in the process--yes, a local \ncontractor has been let out, but security is minimal, and I \nthink you always have to worry any time you have an \naccumulation of chemicals in one location whether it could ever \nbecome a target, whether it is a homegrown terrorist or foreign \nterrorist or whatever, and it seems to me that there could be \nsome risk there.\n    Secretary Ridge. Yes. I am sorry I cannot be more specific, \nSenator, since I am not familiar with the particular venue or \nthe contents at the facility.\n    Senator Allard. Well, thanks for your interest in it at \nleast.\n    In January, the President, in 2003, in the State of the \nUnion address, he had instructed the leaders of the FBI, and \nthe CIA, the Homeland Security, and then the Department of \nDefense to develop a Terrorist Threat Integration Center to \nemerge and analyze all threat information in a single location.\n    And there is a section there in the Homeland Security Act \nthat provided that your Office of Information Analysis and \nInfrastructure Protection is to assess, receive and analyze law \nenforcement information, intelligence information and other \ninformation from agencies of the Federal Government, State and \nlocal Government agencies and private sector entities to \nintegrate such information.\n    Who is in charge of detecting and warning of these threats \nto the homeland? Is it you or is it the Terrorist Threat \nInformation Center?\n    Secretary Ridge. The warning responsibility is given to our \nDepartment. The analytical responsibility is shared. We have \nanalysts in the Threat Integration Center. While we do not \ncollect information, because we are considered a full partner \nin the intelligence community, we can go back to the Threat \nIntegration Center and ask whatever agency responsible for \ngenerating the information to answer questions that we might \nhave from our analytical point of view about that particular \npiece of information.\n    So, again, it is a collaborative exercise. We have analysts \nin it from the CIA, FBI, Homeland Security and others that \npaint a strategic threat picture. It is a real value added to \nour own independent analysis, and on a daily basis we do \nanalytical work together. We, from time to time, go back and \nask for additional information if, as part of their strategic \nanalysis, there is something that catches our eye as it relates \nto our responsibility to secure critical infrastructure.\n    Senator Allard. This has been spread through the various \nagencies and whatnot. I would think that you would have some \nconcern about duplication of effort. How do you limit your \nduplication of effort?\n    Secretary Ridge. Well, Senator, I think having a couple of \ndifferent groups or organizations bringing their various \nexperiences to the analytical side of combatting terrorism is a \ngood thing. Some people call it duplication, others call it \ncompetitive analysis. But I do think it actually is a better \nsituation to have analysts in different departments may have a \nslightly different point of view on a particular piece of \nthreat reporting, and it will be really forced, because of that \ncompetitive analysis, if there is a difference of opinion, for \nthem to look deeper and more critically at that reporting \nstream.\n    I think, by and large, there has been, in my experience so \nfar with Homeland Security and the Threat Integration Center, \nthere has been harmony in terms of the relationship, and \nfrankly not too many differences of opinion as to what it all \nmeans. But when there is a difference of opinion, it just \nsharpens the clarity, and focus and gets a very robust \ndiscussion going on, and I think that is healthy.\n    Senator Allard. I am just curious, we just stood up the \nNorthern Command in the Department of Defense. It seems to me \nthat there ought to be some communication between Northern \nCommand and Homeland Security. Is there some avenues of \ncommunication that have been set up between individuals in \nthose two departments?\n    Secretary Ridge. Well, we can communicate with the Northern \nCommand, but as an old soldier, there is a chain of command \nthat we use in order to do it. But we----\n    Senator Allard. So you feel comfortable with anything that \nthey may be doing, anything that you might be doing and that is \nbeing coordinated.\n    Secretary Ridge. Yes. Well, you know, they just had a very, \nvery significant multi-day, multi-incident exercise, and we \nwere very much involved in the planning process and \nparticipating in that exercise. I am confident, in the months \nand years head, we will get locked up even closer.\n    Senator Allard. There is a computer system being set up. It \nis called the Homeland Security Information Network. You are \nfamiliar with that.\n    Secretary Ridge. Right.\n    Senator Allard. It is supposed to provide critical \ninformation to all 50 States and major urban areas. Can you \nupdate the committee on the program requirements and estimated \ncosts on that.\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, the cost, frankly, is minimal. I \ndo not have a specific dollar amount, but since it is Internet-\nbased, you have the infrastructure there. The costs will be \nassociated with developing a classification system and some \nfirewalls so that we can share, when appropriate, some \nclassified, secret information. But it is actually a system \nthat was developed by New York and California, by the State and \nlocal law enforcement community and a little assistance from I \nthink the Defense Intelligence Agency, and it is the way that \nthey have been communicating between their State and local \nofficials.\n    In one of our travels, some of our folks took a look at it \nand said, You have the backbone here. Let us see if we can \ndevise what they used to call what they used to call was a \nJoint Regional Information Exchange System, JRIES. Let us take \nit nationwide. Let us draft it and tie it into, at first, to \nthe 50 largest urban areas in America so that we have virtual \ncontact with the States and the large urban communities.\n    We used it during the holidays, when we raised, elevated \nthe threat level, with New York City--our Operations Center was \nhooked up with the New York City Police Department and the Los \nAngeles Police Department by virtue of the Internet, and they \nare constantly information on a minute-by-minute basis. So it \nis a good system. It will take us about an entire year to get \nit up and running, but at the end of the day, it will give us \nthe capacity to share information to just about every State and \nlocal law enforcement official in our major urban areas, and we \nthink that is a good thing.\n    Senator Allard. Thank you.\n    I see my time has expired, Mr. Chairman.\n    Next is Senator Feingold."
"feingold","Senator Feingold","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    Mr. Chairman, Mr. Secretary, thank you \nfor being here and for your work on behalf of our country.\n    Let me ask you, first, about something that I have heard \nfrom emergency management officials in my State. They are \nconcerned about a proposal in the President's budget to cut \nfunding for the Emergency Management Performance Grants. They \nare much more concerned about the proposal to cut the \npercentage of grant money that they can use for personnel costs \nfrom 50 percent to 25 percent.\n    I am told that this will have a tremendous impact on \nemergency management officials, especially those in small \ncities and counties, because salaries are often almost 100 \npercent of the cost of local and State emergency management \nprograms. And a number of people told me in meetings back home \nand hearings that many local Governments will simply not be \nable to afford to have an emergency management official. The \nEmergency Management Performance Grant program is a respected \nprogram that our State and local officials have come to depend \non.\n    Why has the administration proposed reducing the personnel \nspending cap for the EMPG grants and potentially undermining \nState and local emergency management capacity?\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, I think it is a decision based \nupon a shared responsibility for personnel costs and a primary \nresponsibility for the Federal Government to send dollars out \nfor training and exercise programs; that we would reduce the \nlevel that we would contribute to defray the salaries and use \nour portion of the funds so that once these men and women were \nin place they would have additional dollars to conduct a \ntraining and exercise program.\n    So it was based on a notion that we have a shared \nresponsibility to pay for the salaries. We have a primary \nresponsibility to help provide funding for training and \nexercises."
"feingold","Senator Feingold","feingold","Senator Feingold","    Well, I understand that. I would just \nindicate that I think this is going to have such a \ndisproportionate impact on some of our smaller counties and \ncommunities, and I hope we can work together to possibly \nreverse this before the budget is complete.\n    I would like you to address EMS funding in your budget. \nWisconsin EMS officials tell me that they feel sort of \noverlooked when it comes to first-responder funding. As you \nknow, there has been no dedicated funding source for EMS \nfunding, and the President's budget proposal does not change \nthat.\n    I am told you will be submitting a report to the \nAppropriations Committee next week discussing the amount of \nfunding EMS teams are receiving through DHS grants and the \nbarriers facing EMS teams as they try to get these grants.\n    Could you say a little bit about your findings and how the \nDepartment is working to make sure that our EMS services are \nnot overlooked.\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, I cannot tell you today what \nproportion of dollars that we have distributed to the State and \nlocal Governments have found their way down to the EMS \npersonnel. Clearly, they are an invaluable part of our first \nresponder community. We relied upon them heavily in \nPennsylvania, as does just about every other State. So I cannot \ngive that specific figure.\n    It is certainly supporting EMS, not so much the personnel \ncosts, but supporting their equipment acquisitions and their \ninvolvement in training exercises is clearly an eligible cost \nfor the homeland security grants and if they are associated \nwith the Urban Security Area Grant money and eligible costs \nthere.\n    I will be able to tell you, in a short period of time, to \nyou and to Congress, as we read the State and territorial plans \nthat they have submitted to us, we should be able to get a read \nas to where they view the EMS infrastructure as a priority for \nthe distribution of the billions and billions of dollars that \nwe have available to them. I just cannot give you the specific \nfigures on that.\n    As a former Governor, I assure you I think EMS is an \nintegral part of the first responder community, and they would \nbe eligible for distribution of these dollars, whether or not \nother Governors or mayors, as they have developed their own \nindividual plans, have decided that, for this distribution, \nthey ought to get some of this money. I do not know yet. We \njust got the plans."
"feingold","Senator Feingold","feingold","Senator Feingold","    Thank you. I was pleased to hear that DHS \nis working to gather and disseminate first responder best \npractices information. The first responders from Wisconsin who \nI have talked to are excited about having a central Best \nPractices Center. The Council on Foreign Relations Independent \nTask Force, chaired by Senator Rudman, also found a real need \nfor such a center, saying that having one would ``allow all \nemergency responders to learn from past experiences and improve \nthe quality of their efforts, thereby assuring taxpayers the \nmaximum return on their investment in homeland security.''\n    How are you involving the local first responder community \nin your efforts to gather and disseminate best practices? And I \nwould like to inform Wisconsin first responders about your \ninitiatives and when they will be in place. When can they \nrealistically expect these programs to be online and available \nfor their use?\n    Secretary Ridge. First of all, Senator, we have as part of \nthe Homeland Security Advisory Council, a group of men and \nwomen specifically out of the first-responder community from \naround the country. And we were asked by the States, in \nanticipation of our request for statewide plans, to give them a \ntemplate. And so we put together the first responder group, as \nwell as a State and local group, and they were the ones that \ndeveloped the template.\n    That is why I am hopeful that I can report back to you that \nas the States took a look at the template that the Advisory \nCommittee gave them that was, in part, authorized by the first \nresponders and EMS folks, that there will be an EMS provision \nthere.\n    We are consolidating the State and local Government and the \nOffice of Domestic Preparedness. We sent a letter to Congress \nhere a couple of weeks ago so it can be a one-stop shop. This \nwill be the driving force behind the initiative to get the best \npractices out. We will probably use many means of communicating \nback to your first responders in Wisconsin, not the least of \nwhich will be the Internet. I cannot give you a specific \ntimeframe, but I will task my people to provide that \ninformation because if the first responders of Wisconsin are \ninterested in it, first responders everywhere will be \ninterested. I just cannot give it to you today."
"feingold","Senator Feingold","feingold","Senator Feingold","    Thank you for that.\n    Other Senators are waiting to ask you questions before you \nhave to leave, so let me just associate myself with the \ncomments of Senator Wyden with regard to data mining, his \nquestions, his emphasis on this. He and I have worked together \non this, and we will continue to work with you and others to \nassure the American people that certain data-mining practices \nare not used in a way that goes beyond the challenge that you \nface, which is the terrorist threat. And this is a matter of \nthe highest priority to me, as it is to Senator Wyden, and we \nlook forward to closely watching this with you.\n    I thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, if I might, I would really like \nto take you up on that offer. I served with Senator Wyden some \ntime ago. I know that is a passionate interest of his, and \nobviously it is yours as well.\n    I do think the most immediate pilot program that we would \nlike to initiate I think goes to the heart of everyone's \nconcern about individual privacy and liberty, and that is the \nCAPPS program. We think we have designed a program that is \nrespectful of individual privacy rights. We know we need GAO's \napproval; i.e., Congress's approval. So particularly with that \ninitiative I would welcome the opportunity to work with you to \naddress any concerns that you and Senator Wyden or, for that \nmatter, any other Members of Congress might have."
"feingold","Senator Feingold","feingold","Senator Feingold","    I look forward to that.\n    Secretary Ridge. Yes, sir. Thank you."
"feingold","Senator Feingold","feingold","Senator Feingold","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Senator Crapo. Thank you very much.\n    Secretary Ridge, we realize that your time is limited. We \nhave three Senators who have not questioned you yet, and I \nbelieve Senator Conrad would like to have another round of \nquestions as well.\n    Secretary Ridge. Sure.\n    Senator Crapo. I am the last one on our side, and I will \njust hold off until we finish up over there. And so we will \nnext go to Senator Nelson."
"nelson","Senator Nelson","feingold","Senator Feingold","    If Senator Murray was here before me, I \nwould certainly defer to her."
"murray","Senator Murray","nelson","Senator Nelson","    No, thank you."
"nelson","Senator Nelson","murray","Senator Murray","    Well, thank you. Thank you, Senator. Mr. \nChairman, Mr. Secretary.\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator."
"nelson","Senator Nelson","nelson","Senator Nelson","    Mr. Secretary, Interpol has testified to \nCongress last summer about the enormous amount of money that is \nbeing made in the knock-off goods trade. We know, for example, \nin the drug trade, that is a source of funding for terrorist \norganizations. But the profit on knock-off goods is enormously \nhigher than the profit on the trafficking in drugs.\n    And I just visited with your folks in the Jacksonville \noffice, where they had just seized an enormous load, in this \nparticular case it was at a flea market, of these goods. And \ninterestingly they import the handbags without the labels. So \nit is legal to import them or the shoes or the pieces of the \nwatches, and then once they are here, they assemble them and \nthen put the Fendi or Ralph Lauren labels on them, which then \nit becomes illegal because it is deception, and that is against \nthe law.\n    And apparently billions of dollars are being made in this \nkind of trade all over the world. A lot of these items are \nbeing manufactured in China, where they can be manufactured \nvery cheaply. So naturally my concern is, particularly with \nFlorida being a place of 14 deep-water ports, where a lot of \ncommerce is coming into this country and where we just had this \nseizure over the weekend.\n    I would want to know, from you, what we can do to help you, \nperhaps first with legislation, increasing the penalties. \nBecause, interestingly, if you get caught dealing in drugs, \nthat is one kind of harsh penalty, but if you get caught \ndealing in these knock-off items, it is a much lesser penalty. \nAnd if we ultimately get the proof that profits from these \ncriminal organizations are going into terrorism, then we better \nbe concerned.\n    The second item that I would wonder would it be helpful for \nus, as the legislators and the appropriators, to do is to \ncreate some kind of public education fund for you so that, when \npeople go and buy these goods--and they know they are getting \nknock-off goods. It is not illegal for them to buy them. It is \nillegal for the guys to sell them--so that they see the \npotential link there with supporting terrorism, and thus a \ncampaign of public service announcements.\n    What do you think, Mr. Secretary?\n    Secretary Ridge. Well, first of all, Senator, I think my \ncolleague, Secretary Hutchinson, testified that, from our point \nof view in border and transportation security, as we inherited \nthe old Customs Department, that this is probably one of the \nfastest-growing areas of criminal activity not just in this \ncountry, but around the world. And the potential for it to be \nlinked up, in time, because we have no contemporary evidence \nthat suggests it is tied to terrorist organizations, but \ncertainly the possibility always exists.\n    So as it comes to enhancing the penalties or some form of \npublic information campaign vis-a-vis the potential consumer, a \ncouple of issues we would certainly look to work with you on. I \nwould defer to Mike Garcia, of Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, as to whether or not he thinks, in his experience, \nthe penalties have been adequate, whether they have been a \nsufficient deterrent and would like to review, get the benefit \nof his analysis and then get back to you with a more complete \nopinion."
"nelson","Senator Nelson","nelson","Senator Nelson","    OK. I will talk with Mr. Garcia then, and I \nhave put this in a letter to you right after I met with your \nfolks on Monday, after this big bust.\n    Secretary Ridge. Good."
"nelson","Senator Nelson","nelson","Senator Nelson","    And that is there in your office. So if you \nwould get your folks to direct it to Mr. Garcia.\n    Secretary Ridge. I will. Thank you."
"nelson","Senator Nelson","nelson","Senator Nelson","    Mr. Secretary, of course, port security is \nof enormous importance to us in Florida, with us having so many \ndeep-water ports. And I am concerned, a year ago the President \nhad no money for the Port Security Grants. The Congress put in \n$125 million. This time the President has put in $43 million \nfor a different kind of other than direct grants.\n    This Senator is going to be working to increase that at \nleast to the level of the $125 million for the grants, but \nbeyond that, if you talk to the Nation Ports Council, as well \nas our own Florida Ports Council, they think, nationally, that \nfrom a security standpoint, that they are lacking about $5 \nbillion. I am going to shoot, over the course of time, for a \ntarget of enhancing it by $2 billion. I would like to have your \nreflection on that, and perhaps this is something we can work \ntogether.\n    I know you have $1.9 billion in the budget, but that \nincludes the Coast Guard, and the Coast Guard has got a bunch \nof other things to do, particularly in the waters off of \nFlorida. Let us hope they do not have to start interdicting an \nexodus out of Haiti, but you know what we have to deal with \ndown there.\n    Secretary Ridge. Yes, sir."
"nelson","Senator Nelson","nelson","Senator Nelson","    Not only that, but the drug runners as \nwell.\n    Secretary Ridge. Yes, sir."
"nelson","Senator Nelson","nelson","Senator Nelson","    Give me your ideas.\n    Secretary Ridge. Well, Senator, I could not help but think, \nwith Senator Murray, after you talked about port security, this \nis a conversation that the Senator and I have had before with \nregard to her perspective and yours as the inadequacy of the \nport funding. And I think it is worthy of the kind of public \ndiscussion, in a civil way, because it is of a civic interest \nto all of us.\n    I just, as a former Governor, as someone who expended and \nsaw expended both Federal, State and local resources in my \nports in Pennsylvania, oftentimes they are publicly owned, you \nhave public employees there, I more or less view them as part \nof the private sector's distribution chain. It is part of their \ninfrastructure. And while I think we have to make the business \ncase that it is important for any major corporation to \nprotection its own supply chain, I think that we need to have \nthat conversation or debate here in the Congress.\n    From my point of view, the Congress has appropriated \nhundreds of millions of dollars not only for grants, but you \nsupport the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard provides enormous port \nsecurity. They are helping them with their security and \nvulnerability assessments. The Coast Guard puts captains of \neach port to coordinate the activity between the public and \nprivate sector.\n    We get to a point I think, given the people and the \nresources we commit to all of these ports, but I think we ought \nto take a look at the private sector to enhance security at \nthese ports. So, again, they are for-profit entities. It is \npart of their supply chain, and I think it is reasonable for \nthe taxpayer to expect a major corporation that is importing \ngoods to sell to our citizens that they invest in their supply \nchain."
"nelson","Senator Nelson","nelson","Senator Nelson","    Well, I am going to help Senator Murray \nhelp you, even though you will not say that you need the help, \nwe are going to try to help you to up that port security money.\n    Thank you.\n    Secretary Ridge. Thank you, Senator.\n    Senator Crapo. Thank you very much.\n    Senator Murray?"
"murray","Senator Murray","nelson","Senator Nelson","    Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n    Obviously, from Florida to Washington State, we are deeply \nconcerned about the administration's proposal on airport \nsecurity, and I again am very concerned, listening to what you \nhave to say, and I do think we need to have a dialog, but we \nneed to do it immediately I think.\n    As a Senator from a State that depends on seaports for its \nlivelihood, we have to have a cohesive port security plan that \nprotects our communities and our economy from potential \nthreats. I know we both agree that the agencies that are \ninvolved in securing our ports are doing an admirable job. They \nare working through a very difficult problem, but if they are \nnot given the proper tools, and resources and guidance to knit \ntogether a coordinated approach, all of us are left vulnerable.\n    You talk about the supply chain, but that is only part of \nwhat port security is. Our ports are where a container or \nsomething can come in and enter this country in a way that puts \neverybody's security at risk.\n    I am deeply concerned about putting our security in the \nhands of the private sector when I know how much they are \nstruggling today with costs of their own. And if they do not do \nit, we have left a real weak link in the chain at whatever port \njust simply does not have the money to do it.\n    But there is another issue as well, and I have listened to \nyou. You answered my question before when I asked you about \nthis, by saying that the private sectors for goods moving in \nand out, similar to what you just said, and they should be \nresponsible for picking up. I noticed that on I think it was \nNews Hour with Jim Lehrer you said that the administration \nshould engage the private sector and that it should be their \ndollars to provide security.\n    Let me tell you what my problem with that is. We are at a \nreal competitive disadvantage if we start requiring our ports \nin this country to pay for security. We already have a problem \nin Tacoma and Seattle with, if our prices are higher, \ncontainers are diverted to Vancouver. I know that is the same \ncase in California. I do not know if that occurs in Florida. I \nassume it would. If the costs of bringing containers into our \nports increases, if our private sector has to put that money in \nthere, those containers will not come into this country. Now, \nthat means a tremendous loss of jobs. That means killing jobs \nright here in the United States.\n    My State is deeply concerned about this. If there is a \nFederal mandate that we have port security, and there is a \nreason that we should have that, it will have to be paid for. \nIf our costs go up, those containers will be diverted. Now, \nthat is an economic factor. It is a security factor as well, \nand it is a job killer in the State.\n    So I wanted to engage you in that conversation today. I am \nglad that the Senator from Florida brought it up. He is \ncorrect. It is completely underfunded in this. If we are \nrelying on the private sector to do it, I think we need to know \nhow much you anticipate our port security efforts will cost the \nprivate sector.\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, first of all, let me just, at the \noutset, say that we have a continuing responsibility that, \nagain, as part of the Federal share, to continue to deploy our \nCustoms and Border Patrol people there. We are going to make, \nthrough congressional appropriations, additional purchases of \nthe nonintrusive technology, gamma ray and X-ray machines. So \nthat is an ongoing contribution to enhancing port security.\n    But when it comes to some of the other features of port \nsecurity, again----"
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    Other features meaning?\n    Secretary Ridge. Well, surveillance cameras, fencing, \ninfrastructure that accommodates the intermodal nature of \nsecuring the infrastructure that accommodates the railroads or \nthe trucking companies that come in. I mean, there are security \nprofiles and things that I think can be done at relatively low \ncost. We are in the process of----"
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    Well, the commandant told us that the cost \nwould be $7 billion.\n    Secretary Ridge. Seven billion dollars spread over a period \nof years? If that is the case, and I do not----"
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    I do know that the requests last year to \nyour department for port security were over a billion dollars, \nand I have worked with a number of these ports. I mean, we had \na wake-up call on September 11th, and many of these ports had \nabsolutely no security in them. They are a huge weak link in \nour security chain, and they know that. They have been trying \nto step up to it. Congress told them to put together their \nplans. They have. I am aware that some of it is fencing and \nsecurity cameras, but if we just say, private companies, you go \ndo that, I know it will not happen.\n    Secretary Ridge. Well, first of all, Senator, I need to \nreiterate, in addition to my preference that the private sector \npick up more of the additional expense with security because \nthe taxpayer is already paying for a substantial part of the \nsecurity, I think the taxpayer owns a lot of the land, has \nprovided some of the initial security, but remember we began \nthe security protocol before the container is even put on the \nship."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    Well, I heard your answer to Senator \nCorzine----\n    Secretary Ridge. I guess it becomes a question of what is \nthe additional security that you are most concerned with for \npurposes of our discussion? Is it continued scrutiny of the \ncontents of the containers?"
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    Well, I heard your answer to Senator \nCorzine, and I think he asked you what percentage of containers \nwere screened, and you said 98 percent.\n    Secretary Ridge. Right."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    I am assuming that you are talking about \nthe 24-hour-rule for screening manifests.\n    Secretary Ridge. Correct."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    That does not look at what is in \ncontainers. How many containers are screened before they ever \nenter our ports?\n    Secretary Ridge. Actual physical screening, there is no \nquota, but I think now it is about 5.4 percent."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    That is----\n    Secretary Ridge. But I would say to the Senator, we could \nphysically screen every container----"
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    We do not want to do that. I think there \nare really good programs in place to not do that.\n    Secretary Ridge. You could do it, but the economic costs \nassociated with the physical screening of every container \ncoming across by railroad car, coming across by truck, coming \nacross by the shipping container, would be a far, far greater \nimpact on the overall national economy than modest improvements \nat several hundred ports around the country."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    And I do not think anybody believes that we \nneed to do the actual physical.\n    Secretary Ridge. Right."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    But I do think there are ways to provide \nsecurity at ports where the containers are loaded before they \never get there and track them here, which is what Operation \nSafe Commerce was put in place to do. But----\n    Secretary Ridge. What we may decide to use, Senator, \ndepending on those lessons, there may or may not be a Federal \nrole. I am not prejudging that one way or the other."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    And actually some of that money still has \nnot gotten out to them, so we are way behind the curve on where \nwe need to be in order to learn that.\n    But let me go back to the basic question here because it is \na critical one for our economy. If that $7 billion that the \ncommandant himself told us was going to be necessary, and the \nvast majority of that is going to be required to be paid for by \nprivate companies, they will increase the costs to them at \ntheir containers. How do we deal with the competition? That \nmeans we will lose jobs in Washington State, I am assuming \nCalifornia, Florida, other ports on the East. I know we will in \nWashington State. I know our containers will be diverted. It is \nan economic challenge they face every single day.\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, the assessment of the commandant \nof the Coast Guard was based on their review I think of most of \nour major ports, if not all of our major ports. I believe it \nwas the optimum costs associated with the security plans to be \ndealt with over a period of time. As we buildup security \ninfrastructure, be it at a port, be it at a local community, we \nare not going to ramp it up all at once, No. 1.\n    No. 2, we have to be in the business of managing the risk, \nand when it comes to managing the risk around shipping \ncontainers, if that is the concern we have about enhanced \nsecurity at domestic ports, we begin that process before the \ncontainer is boarded on the ship.\n    There is a very sophisticated rulemaking device, based on \ninformation we have from intelligence, from data that we have \naccumulated over the years, so we have a pretty good way of \ntargeting potentially troublesome containers, for a variety of \nreasons: criminal information we have, threat information we \nmight have, coupled with the information we have secured by \nCustoms and the Coast Guard over the years. That process begins \nbefore these are ever loaded."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    Are you confident, as Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, that our ports are secure today and that we are safe \nfrom having a container come into any one of our major ports?\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, if you are asking me to guarantee \nyou the safety of 20,000 containers coming into the port every \nday, I will not do that. It can physically be done, but if we \nare going to talk about the impact on the economy, Senator, I \nthink we need to understand that in an international economy, a \ndomestic economy that is in the trillions of dollars, and so \nmuch of it relies on container security, we have to manage the \nrisk, and you manage that risk----"
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    I understand that. But what I am asking is \nyou are saying that, under the plans that our ports have put in \nplace, that the vast majority of that is going to have to come \nup with the private companies to pay for, are you confident \nthat they will do that, that the plans will be put in place and \nthat we can tell our citizens who live within blocks of a major \nport, work in our major ports, that they are secure? And even \nbeyond that, if a container comes in, and the ports are shut \ndown, and stores in Senator Conrad's State no longer have \nanything on the shelves because we do not have any imports, are \nyou confident that that will occur?\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, I believe that the business of \nsecuring America is not exclusively the business of the \nAmerican taxpayer. I believe the business of securing America, \nsecuring ports, securing chemical sites, securing nuclear \nsites, there is a shared responsibility. It is both in terms of \nleadership and financial responsibility.\n    Now, what the division of costs associated with port \nsecurity is between the public and the private sector, that \nremains for a very good public discussion, as we are having \nright now. But if every time we look to a particular sector \nwithin our economy and say that we cannot guarantee a fail-safe \nsystem, which we can never do any how, but insist that the \ntaxpayer pay the entire measure for securing the private \nsector, that is just a philosophical difference as to how we go \nabout integrating the resources and accepting the shared \nresponsibility of securing the country.\n    What balance is in there, Senator, remains to be seen. We \ncertainly are going to have a continuing responsibility to buy \nnonintrusive technology, to continue to ramp up, and we have \nasked you for additional money for the Targeting Center. There \nwill be other very significant Federal funds invested in \nsecuring these containers.\n    You continue to give more money to the Coast Guard, I mean, \nthere is a long list of things that the taxpayer is providing \nfor to provide security, but I do think it will be helpful for \nus, once we get these vulnerability assessments completed and \nwe take a look at the precise nature of these security plans, \nto see what is appropriate Federal costs and what should be \nborne by the private sector."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    What do you expect the time line to be able \nto tell our private companies what their costs are going to be \non this?\n    Secretary Ridge. First of all, Senator, I do not think they \nare operating in isolation because the captains of each and \nevery port, more often than not, obviously, a member of the \nCoast Guard--you know, they sit down, and they have worked with \nthese men and women in these companies for quite some time. And \nthe level of security around these ports, not all, but most of \nthem, was pretty good around some of them, nonexistent around \nothers, but every day I think around the country, particularly \nat the major ports, they are doing more to integrate their \nsecurity efforts, Federal and public.\n    And it just remains, I cannot tell you today what those \ncosts will be, but I think in time we will have a pretty good \nidea. And then we have to decide, as a country--both public and \nprivate sector--at what level do we take security at any of \nthese venues?"
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    I understand all of that. I know my time \nis----\n    Secretary Ridge. How high is the fence? How many cameras?"
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    I just have to tell you, where I get really \nnervous with your argument is that if we rely on the private \nsector to do it, and they either do not have a money or there \nis a competitive disadvantage that they do not or for whatever \nreason, they are operating in thin margins that they do not, \nwho will end up paying for a tragedy is all of us.\n    Secretary Ridge. But, Senator, I am still trying to \nunderstand, I am still trying to understand is your concern \nwith regard to the security of the port from domestic \ninfiltration across into the port or is your concern the \npotential vulnerability around the container? I mean, there are \ndifferent kinds of security concerns around a port, and I think \nthat is where, very appropriately, the discussion would be who \nhas what responsibility for what security concerns."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    Well, I think both, but I do think the \npotential for something coming in a container on a ship into \none of our ports, and you are the Secretary, and you know the \ninformation better than I do, is out there. It has always been \npart of what we need to understand, and accept and do something \nabout, and that is a huge concern for me.\n    Secretary Ridge. Again, Senator, I thing the approach we \nare taking, laying in the targeting, the physical inspection of \nsome of these containers before they get on the ship, we do \nboard some of these high-interest vessels before----"
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    The 5 percent that you said are looked at \nbefore they----\n    Secretary Ridge. The 5.4, that's right. There is no quota. \nWhenever we find a high-interest container, we run it through \nthe machine, and if there is something that reveals itself when \nit is run through the technology, we go in and open up the \ncontainer. And it is about managing the risk."
"murray","Senator Murray","murray","Senator Murray","    Well, I agree with the Senator from \nFlorida. I think we need to make sure we have the funds \navailable and put in place a strong security system, and I look \nforward to working with you.\n    Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, I do too. Thank you.\n    Senator Crapo. Thank you.\n    Mr. Secretary, the Department of Homeland Security has an \nimportant role in defending our homeland against bioterrorist \nattacks, including those involving anthrax, and smallpox and \nother toxins. And I note in your testimony that you have \nallocated some of the time and attention of your remarks here \ntoday to that.\n    Could you please expand a little bit on that and tell this \ncommittee first how the fiscal year 2004 Department of Homeland \nSecurity funding is being allocated to meet those threats and \nthen, second, how you will utilize any funding in fiscal year \n2005 that we may appropriate for deterring or responding to \nsuch bioterrorism threats.\n    Secretary Ridge. First of all, Senator, our responsibility \nwith regard to bioterrorism is joint with the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. I think, as you recall, when we \nfirst sought to create a Department of Homeland Security, the \nlegislation we initially sent to the Hill, we had requested the \nentire portfolio of bioterrorism defense responsibility, but I \nthink Congress said that you have Health and Human Services, \nyou have the NIH, you have the Centers for Disease Control, \nthey will have primary responsibility, but there are roles that \nyou play.\n    One of the roles we play is to direct some of the research \nand development on technology that would help us sense a bio \nattack, bio sensors and chemical sensors, and so a considerable \nportion of the research and development dollars you have given \nto S&T is going out to the bio sensors.\n    We have also built on the Bio Watch program we have located \naround the country. EPA has air quality monitoring stations at \nvarious sites around the country. Last year, we expanded those \nsites to include some modest technology that enables us to pick \nup potentially some bio or chemical agents, but it is still a \nvery labor-intensive process, and so some of the dollars that \nyou have given us are going into technology that will actually \ncapture whatever that agent is in the air, analyze it right at \nthat point so we do not have to manually take the filter out \nand take it to a lab to get done. So we have that \nresponsibility.\n    We have a shared responsibility when it comes to Bio \nShield. That is the program where both the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services and Homeland Security, based on threat, can \naccess the dollars that Congress provided. If the threat \nindicates a biological threat, we view it as credible. We look \nat our stockpile of vaccines and antidotes, make a \ndetermination that we do not have anything in this country to \ncombat that threat. Congress has appropriated $2.5 billion for \nus to access that.\n    So, again, there are a variety of different ways. We \ninteract both with Health and Human Services or act \nindependently on our own to deal with a bioterrorist incident.\n    Senator Crapo. All right. Thank you. I have several other \nquestions, but I think I am going to submit them to you in \nwriting because I have just been informed that you are really \nover time.\n    Secretary Ridge. I appreciate it. I have to be with your \ncolleagues on the other side of the Hill.\n    Senator Crapo. Senator Conrad."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","murray","Senator Murray","    Yes, I would just be very brief.\n    Again, it has been good to have you here, Mr. Secretary.\n    Let me tell you my honest assessment is that with all of \nthe work that has been done, the resources that have been \ndevoted, we are still ill prepared to deal especially with a \nchemical and biological--chemical or biological attack on this \nNation's urban centers. I have tried to evaluate, based on my \nstaff's analysis, the feedback we have ten from these \nexperiments, if you will, in major cities. We look at the \nexperience in Denver, and what we saw was really chaos; that \nthe health providers basically left their hospitals. Everybody \nheaded for the hills.\n    I worry very much what would happen if there were a \nchemical and biological attack on the Nation's capital, if \nthere were a chemical, biological attack on New York City, if \nthere were a chemical or biological attack on our Nation's \nstadiums. I worry very much about that. I can imagine if they \nflew over a small plane with a chemical and biological agent \nand sprayed the crowd, the chaos and panic that would ensue. \nAnd I do not think we are yet as prepared as we need to be for \nthose threats and that eventually.\n    I noted that there are places where the money is being \nspent that just make no sense. We talked about the thousands of \ndollars for leather jackets, and $500,000 for a digital camera \nfor mug shots, and Dale Carnegie courses for sanitation \nsupervisors. This is not money that you authorized. This is \nmoney that went to local units of Government, but this is what \nthey did: Maryland cutting State spending for local health care \noutreach centers and then using Federal funds to fill in, \nbasically substituting Federal funds for State funds, an \n$800,000 mobile command bus that they said would be the talk of \nthe East Coast.\n    You know, these are things that do not make lot of sense to \nme. And the conclusion that I want to leave you with is that \nmore money will be frittered away without a clear national plan \nspelling out what first responders need to be able to do in an \nemergency and more stringent guidelines on how the money should \nbe spent. That is not my conclusion. That is the conclusion \nfrom this detailed article that was in the Washington Post that \nI know you paid careful attention to.\n    Can you just tell us what it is you are doing to make sure \nthat this money does get spent wisely and effectively and what \nyou are doing to lay out a clear national plan, spelling out \nwhat these first responders need to be able to do.\n    Secretary Ridge. Senator, during the past several months, \nin addition to worrying and directing congressionally \nappropriated dollars out to first responders, we have been \nworking and created a national response plan and a national \nincident management system that has been accepted and will be \nused as the framework within which we can set guidelines and \nstandards for our first responders. There are certain protocols \nthat we will expect to be done in the event of a chemical \nincident, a biological incident and the like. So we have the \nframework of how we are going to train and exercise our first \nresponders that show up to save lives in an incident.\n    In addition to that, this is the first year that we are \ngoing to have the statewide plans, which hopefully were built \non the template that the Department sent out to the Governors. \nWe asked the Governors to take the lead.\n    I think you are going to find, from 2005 forward, that we \nare going to be far more prescriptive in where these dollars \nwould go so that we can monitor, on an annual basis, that we \nare able to say that that infrastructure that we all believe we \nneed to buildup, sometimes it is a complete infrastructure in a \nmajor urban area, sometimes it is a mutual aid infrastructure \naround a wider, less-populated area. So we know that we have \nthe training exercises and the equipment, consistent with the \nprotocols that we have developed in the incident management \nsystem, to respond to a terrorist attack.\n    So, again, I do think that we are far better prepared than \nwe were a year ago. I do think we have a long way to go to get \nwhere we want to be, and our goal every single day, Senator, is \nto make sure we rise to a new level of readiness and \npreparation. I think we reached that goal, but we will now be \nin a position, having developed these statewide plans, and we \nhave already alerted the Governors and the mayors to be a \nlittle bit more--we will be more prescriptive as to the menu \nthat you can call on to spend Federal money."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Well, I think that is just very important. \nAgain, I would say to you the one place that I think we are \nstill deficient is the preparation for a chemical or biological \nattack in one of our major urban areas or one of our stadiums. \nI hope there is just an intense focus on preparation, and I \nthink the need to exercise, to train in a way that is a \nrealistic replication of what might occur is critically \nimportant.\n    Secretary Ridge. Thank you, Senator.\n    Senator Crapo. Mr. Secretary, we thank you for your time \nand apologize that we have kept you over. This is very \nimportant information, and we will submit to you some \nadditional questions that we did not get to ask. But, again, \nthank you very much for your time, and you can get on your way.\n    Secretary Ridge. Thank you very much."

"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Chairman Nickles. Mr. Secretary, we are delighted to have \nyou come before the Senate Budget Committee again. We \nappreciate your appearances both last year and this year. You \nhave done an outstanding job. I compliment you on your \nleadership. As Secretary of State through a very challenging \ntime in a lot of areas in the world, you have been an \noutstanding leader representing this government, this \nadministration, and I compliment you for it.\n    You are here today to present the administration's budget \non international affairs. This budget at this particular time, \nis a very big challenge. We have enormous deficits. We are \ncalling almost for a freeze. The administration has proposed \nalmost a freeze in all spending other than defense and homeland \nsecurity, and international affairs. Your increases consume \nalmost all the growth revenue in non-defense. It is a big \nincrease. And so we look forward to your defending that \nincrease.\n    There are big increases for the Millennium Challenge and \nalso for the very big battle of combating AIDS. I happen to be \na supporter of the Millennium Challenge, but I am also trying \nto put a budget together, and I realize how difficult and \nchallenging that can be.\n    I welcome you before the committee. I appreciate your \nwillingness to cooperate with us. Before I call on you for \nopening comments, I will ask my colleague and friend, Senator \nConrad, for opening remarks."

break,break,break,break
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and again, thank \nyou for convening this hearing.\n    Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for once again coming up to \ntestify on the budget proposal that is before us.\n    I think it may be most appropriate to start with the \nheadline from this morning's paper, which should sober us all \nwith respect to where this is all heading, that is, these \nmassive deficits that now Chairman Greenspan has said will \nrequire cuts in Social Security in order to, in part, respond \nto where this is all headed.\n    Yesterday, Chairman Greenspan called for those cuts in \nSocial Security. This is something I have been concerned about \nand have been warning about for 3 years, that the budget \npolicies of the President are inevitably and inexorably taking \nus in this direction."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    We have record budget deficits now, and the President \nproposes further cutting the revenue base and adding to \nspending. That can only make the deficits worse, more serious, \nand put more pressure on recommendations like the one the \nChairman made yesterday to cut Social Security benefits.\n    When I look at the President's budget proposal for this \nyear and compare it to previous years in International, what I \nsee is a disturbing pattern that the budget proposed by the \nPresident is not the real budget--not the real budget for \ninternational affairs, not the real budget in other areas as \nwell, because time after time the President has come back to us \nand asked us for significant increases in what he proposed in \nhis initial budget. That is certainly true in international \naffairs where he came back and asked for $1.3 billion more \nafter he submitted in budget in 2002, asked for $8 billion more \nin 2003, and then last year came back and asked for $21.6 \nbillion more than his initial budget request.\n    Now, Mr. Secretary, I would very much like to hear from you \nwhether we can expect another large supplemental for \ninternational affairs in 2005.\n    In the President's budget proposal for 2005, international \naffairs is receiving the largest percentage increase of any \narea, a 16-percent increase in budget authority. In comparison, \nthe President proposes to increase homeland security by 5 \npercent, defense by 4 percent, and cut all other domestic \nspending by 4 percent when measured against CBO's baseline.\n    As you know, Mr. Secretary, and every member of this \ncommittee knows, our budget deficit is skyrocketing. We have a \ndeficit that is forecast at $521 billion this year. I \npersonally believe it will not be that high, but, nonetheless, \nit will clearly be a record, much higher than any previous \ndeficit, at least $100 billion more than any that we have seen \nbefore.\n    And the President has told us, well, don't worry, the \ndeficits are going to be cut in half over the next 5 years. I \ndon't believe that. I don't think that is an accurate report to \nthe American people on our fiscal condition. I don't think it \ncomes close. The President says we are going to have a deficit \nof $237 billion in the fifth year. But the only way he gets \nthere is he just leaves out things. He leaves out any defense \nexpenditure, additional defense expenditure for the war on \nterror past September 30th. He leaves out dealing with the \nalternative minimum tax. And, most significantly, he leaves out \nthe money he is going to have to pay back to Social Security \nand Medicare that he is taking from the trust funds.\n    So I believe we have to tackle this in a very aggressive \nway, and we have to go after the spending side of the equation. \nWe also have to look to the revenue side of the equation \nbecause the revenue side of the equation is where the biggest \ngap has opened. This year, CBO is telling us that revenue will \nfall to 15.7 percent of GDP, the lowest since 1950.\n    Mr. Secretary, I would like to bring you back to something \nyou said 2 years ago when testifying before this committee. I \nasked you then how the Nation could afford the President's \nproposed increase in the international affairs budget, and I \nasked you if we should cut spending in other areas or raise \nrevenues to pay for it. And this was your answer: ``I think \nwhere we are right now is that for the foreseeable future, for \nthe next several years, we may well have to increase the debt, \nas your chart shows, in order to deal with these priorities.''"

"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    I think in light of what Chairman Greenspan said yesterday \nthat it is appropriate to ask you: Is that still the right \nanswer? Can we afford to continue on this course of borrowing \nand borrowing and borrowing, borrowing from Social Security, \nborrowing from the Medicare Trust Fund, borrowing from the \nJapanese and the Chinese and the South Koreans, borrowing from \nthe so-called Caribbean banking centers, hundreds of billions \nof dollars to float this boat, whether that can possibly \ncontinue?\n    Mr. Secretary, I noted in a recent Newsweek column from \nFareed Zakaria, a foreign affairs commentator who has often \nbeen a supporter of the President's international policies--and \nI will conclude on this note: ``The greatest threat to \nAmerica's primacy in the world comes not from its overseas \ncommitments, explains Niall Ferguson. It is the result of \nAmerica's chronically unbalanced domestic finances. The \nmounting Federal budget deficits that now stretch out as far as \nthe eye can see will mean, if history is any guide, sharp \ncutbacks in American military and foreign affairs spending. We \nwill see a forced retreat of America's foreign policy similar \nto the years after the Vietnam War, only the cuts are likely to \nbe much, much deeper and the resulting chaos far greater.''"

"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Now, my first question to you will be: Is that going to be \nthe legacy of this administration? And how can that outcome be \navoided?\n    I thank you again, Mr. Secretary, for being here.\n    Chairman Nickles. Secretary Powell, we welcome you to the \ncommittee. Please give any opening remarks you wish."

"","","conrad","Senator Conrad"," STATEMENT OF HON."
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Secretary Powell. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I do \nhave a prepared statement which I offer for the record.\n    Chairman Nickles. Thank you.\n    Secretary Powell. I will summarize that statement and then \nbe ready for your questions.\n    Before I begin, Mr. Chairman, let me say that we started \ntoday on a very sad note with the news that President Boris \nTrajkovski of Macedonia was in a plane crash which may have \ntaken his life and others aboard the plane. He was a great \nfriend of the United States. I have spoken to the new Acting \nPresident and expressed the sympathy and condolences on behalf \nof the President and all of the American people. When I became \nSecretary of State in January of 2001, one of the first issues \nI had to deal with was a crisis in Macedonia. The place was \ncoming apart, with a new President who was in great difficulty \nand anguish as to how to deal with the problems he was facing, \nand that was Boris Trajkovski. And I became a very good friend \nof his over the years and he a good friend of mine. And we \nworked through the problems in Macedonia to the point now where \nMacedonia is on a stable footing, the European Union is going \nto be replacing NATO with respect to providing additional \nsupport. We have much to be proud of as to what we have \naccomplished in Macedonia with our European friends and with \nthe Macedonian people and the Macedonia leaders, especially \nwith President Trajkovski. So he will be greatly missed, and we \nwish the Macedonian people all the best in this time of \ntragedy.\n    Mr. Chairman, let me also take this opportunity to say to \nyou how much I have deeply appreciated your support in the \nyears that you have been in the Senate and as a member of this \ncommittee and chairman of this committee. You have been a good \nfriend to the Department. We have done many things together \nover many years, Senator, and I just wanted to take this \nopportunity to thank you on behalf of all the men and women of \nthe State Department for the support that you have provided to \nus.\n    And I would like to say to the entire committee how much I \nhave appreciated the support you have given to the Department \nin the 3 years of my stewardship. I made certain promises to \nthe committee when I came in about what we would do to fix \nmanagement and similar sorts of issues, leadership issues, \ninfrastructure issues within the Department and you have \nsupported our efforts, and I think you can see the payoff in \nwhat we are doing with respect to our Diplomatic Readiness \nInitiative, how more and more people are coming into the \nDepartment. We fixed the problems of the previous 10 years when \npeople were not being recruited. Information technology has \nbeen improved. Morale has improved. And it could not have been \ndone without the support of this committee and the entire \nCongress, and I express my appreciation for that as well.\n    Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I want to thank \nyou for the opportunity to testify on the State Department's \nportion of the President's budget request for fiscal year 2005. \nThe 2005 international affairs budget request for the \nDepartment of State, USAID, and other foreign affairs agencies, \nas was noted by Senator Conrad, totals $31.5 billion, broken \ndown as follows: foreign operations, $21.3 billion; State ops, \n$8.4 billion; P.L. 480 food aid, $1.2 billion; international \nbroadcasting, $569 million; and the U.S. Institute for Peace, \n$22 million.\n    President Bush's top foreign policy priority remains \nwinning the war on terrorism. And winning on the battlefield \nwith our superb military forces is just one step in this \nprocess and one part of this campaign. To eradicate terrorism \naltogether, the United States must help create stable \ngovernments and nations that once supported terrorism, like \nIraq and Afghanistan. And we must go after terrorist support \nmechanisms as well as the terrorists themselves. We must help \nalleviate conditions in the world that enable terrorists to \nbring in new recruits.\n    To these ends, in fiscal year 2005 our foreign affairs \nagencies will continue to focus on the reconstruction of Iraq \nand Afghanistan. We will continue to support our coalition \npartners to further our counterterrorism, law enforcement, and \nintelligence operations and cooperation. And we will continue \nto expand democracy and help generate prosperity, especially in \nthe Middle East.\n    Mr. Chairman, 48 percent of the President's budget for \nforeign affairs supports the war on terrorism. For example, \n$1.2 billion supports Afghanistan reconstruction, security and \ndemocracy building. More than $5.7 billion provides assistance \nto countries around the world that have joined us in the war on \nterrorism; $3.5 billion indirectly supports the war on \nterrorism by strengthening our ability to respond to \nemergencies and conflict situations. And, finally, $190 million \nis aimed at expanding democracy in the greater Middle East, \ncrucial if we are to attack successfully the motivation to \nterrorism, the roots of terrorism.\n    Two of the greatest challenges confronting us today are the \nreconstruction of Iraq and the reconstruction of Afghanistan, \nso let me first turn to Iraq.\n    The Coalition Provisional Authority, under the leadership \nof Ambassador Bremer, and the Iraqi Governing Council have made \ngreat strides in the areas of security, economic stability and \ngrowth, and democratization. Iraqi security forces now comprise \nmore than half of the total security forces in the country, and \nover time that percentage will grow. In addition, the CPA has \nestablished, working with the Governing Council, a new Iraqi \nArmy, issued a new currency, which is quite stable, and \nrefurbished and equipped schools and hospitals and town centers \nand all of the other institutions and infrastructure one needs \nfor a democratic society. And as you know, the CPA is taking \nsteps to return sovereignty to the Iraqi people this summer. We \nare still committed to a turnover of sovereignty on the 30th of \nJune.\n    Much work remains to be done. Working with our coalition \npartners, we will continue to train Iraqi police, border \nguards, Civil Defense Corps, and the Army in order to ensure \nthe country's security as we effect a timely transition to \ndemocratic self-governance and a stable future.\n    At the same time, we are helping to build critical \ninfrastructure for the people--clean water, electricity, \nreliable telecommunications, all the systems needed for the \nbasic needs of the people. All of this work goes on. It is \ngoing on with greater and greater effect and efficiency over \ntime. It tends not to get the headlines, but the cellular \ntelephone system is coming up, the land-line system is coming \nup. More and more people are gaining access to clean water. The \nelectricity system is improving, and by the end of the year \nwill be far ahead of anything that existed in the time of \nSaddam Hussein. Thousands of brave Americans, in uniform and in \nmufti, are in Iraq now working tirelessly to help the Iraqis \nsucceed in this historic effort. Along side their military \ncolleagues, USAID, State Department, and the Departments of \nCommerce and Treasury are working to implement infrastructure, \ndemocracy building, education, health, and economic development \nprograms. These efforts are producing real progress in Iraq.\n    The United Nations Secretary General's Special Advisor, \nLakhdar Brahimi, a very distinguished individual, returned from \nIraq recently and gave his report to the Secretary General. The \nSecretary General released the report on Monday of this week, \nand we have had the report since it went to the Security \nCouncil, and we have been studying it. By any measure, the task \nwe are facing is going to be difficult and complicated, but it \nis achievable. We are going to be moving toward elections as \nfast as we can in Iraq, but before we can get to elections that \nare done openly and fairly and allow all people in the society \nto participate, we want to go to an interim authority, an \ninterim sovereign, until we can get full sovereignty on the \nbasis of a constitution and the election of a legislature, and \nfrom that process new leaders who enjoy the full support of the \nIraqi people.\n    Creating a democratic government in Iraq will be an \nenormous challenge, but Ambassador Bremer, working with the \nIraqi Governing Council and now with the United Nations as \ntheir full partners, is committed to success. And I think we \nwill be successful. And the State Department is working hard to \nbe prepared to assume a leadership role on the 1st of July, \nwhen the CPA will go out of existence and we will have a large \nembassy requiring new resources to stand up. It will be the \nlargest diplomatic presence we have anywhere in the world.\n    Afghanistan is another high priority for the \nadministration. The United States is committed to helping build \na stable and democratic Afghanistan that is free from terror \nand no longer harbors threats to our security. After we and our \ncoalition partners defeated the Taliban government, we faced \nthe daunting task of helping the Afghan people rebuild their \ncountry. I remember those first few days when President Karzai \nwent in, no telephones--one telephone for the entire \ngovernment. No money, no accounts, no nothing. No desks, no \ncomputers, no nothing. And in a short period of time in the \nsweep of history, in just a couple of years, we now have a \nfunctioning government that is increasingly reaching out to \ntake greater control over the outlying provinces, to bring \norder throughout the country, a currency that is relatively \nstable. We are giving more and more technical assistance to \nAfghanistan so that they can get higher up on the food ladder \nand on the economic ladder and on the democracy ladder, women \nare being integrated into the society in every way possible. \nThe lives of women and girls have improved so much over the \npast 2 years and will continue to in the years to come.\n    Since 2001, the United States has rehabilitated 205 \nschools, 140 health clinics, and trained 13 battalions of the \nAfghan National Army. It is still a dangerous situation. We saw \nfive aid workers were killed yesterday by those remnants of the \nTaliban and other terrorists in Afghanistan, particularly in \nthe southeast part of the country, that we know our work is not \nyet completed. And we are working, as you may have noted in the \npress recently, with our Pakistani friends to do more with \nrespect to bringing that part of the country under control, \nalso working with our NATO allies to increase NATO presence in \nthe country, increase the number of provincial reconstruction \nteams working in the country so that the countryside can be \nmade safe for democracy and for development efforts.\n    We are also pleased that we completed the project to pave \nthe road from Kabul to Kandahar, and that was successfully \ndone. The 30-hour journey is now down to just 5 or 6 hours. It \nis not just a road and the journey. We are connecting the \ncountry once again so it is viable.\n    While the Afghanistan of today is very different from that \nof September 2001, there is much left to be done, and we will \nbe participating in a conference in the not-too-distance future \nwith our friends and allies to see what else we need to be \ndoing to help the Afghan people and President Karzai.\n    The challenges we face in Iraq and Afghanistan are complex, \ndaunting, and dangerous. We must not lose sight of the simple \nfact that two despotic, awful, terrible, miserable, disgraceful \nregimes are no longer in power, either in Kabul or in Baghdad. \nAnd both the people of Iraq and the people of Afghanistan have \na brighter future to look forward to. Lives have been spent in \nthis cause, the brave lives of coalition soldiers and the brave \nlives of civilians who gave their lives as well. And we mourn \nfor them, but we will never, ever let their families think that \nthey were lost in vain. They were not. It is a noble cause that \nthey have been involved in, in both Afghanistan and Iraq, and \nit is up to us now to keep that work moving forward and not to \nshrink from the challenges ahead and to recognize all that we \nhave achieved so far.\n    It is expensive work. As I said 2 years ago, Senator, we \nwere facing new challenges, and it might require additional \ndebt to get ourselves through this period of challenge. That \nchallenge is still with us. We have had to come in for \nsignificant supplemental increases for reconstruction efforts, \nfor our defense efforts, and for our international affairs \nefforts. And the President is committed to doing everything he \ncan in accordance with the plan that he has submitted to the \nCongress to bring the deficit under control, cutting it in half \nwithin the timeframe that he indicated. And I can assure you \nthat he recognizes that this is an important task for the \nadministration. And so we all have been told to make our \nrequests as reasonable as we can, to seek no increases that are \nnot necessary, to find savings within our budgets, and I think \nthat is what we have tried to do in the State Department \nsubmission for 2005.\n    As I mentioned earlier, the 2005 budget for international \naffairs provides more than $5.7 billion for assistance to \ncountries around the world that have joined us in the war on \nterrorism, including Turkey, Jordan, Afghanistan, Colombia, \nPakistan, Indonesia, and the Philippines.\n    While progress has been made attacking terrorist \norganizations both globally and regionally, much more remains \nto be done, and the President's budget supports that effort. A \nfew highlights: $700 million for Pakistan to help advance \nsecurity and economic cooperation and opportunity for \nPakistan's citizens, including a multi-year educational support \nprogram; $461 million for Jordan; $577 million for Colombia to \nsupport President Uribe's unified campaign against drugs and \nterrorism.\n    In September 2003, at the United Nations, President Bush \nsaid, ``All governments that support terror are complicit in a \nwar against civilization. No government should ignore the \nthreat of terror, because to look the other way gives \nterrorists the chance to regroup and recruit and prepare. And \nall nations that fight terror, as if the lives of their own \npeople depend on it, will earn the favorable judgment of \nhistory.'' We are helping countries to that judgment.\n    Two weeks ago, the President spoke at the National Defense \nUniversity and spoke about another threat that we are facing--\nthe threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \ntechnology. The President described how we have worked for \nyears to uncover one particular nefarious network, that of Dr. \nA.Q. Khan.\n    Men and women of our own and other intelligence services, \nespecially the United Kingdom, were able to understand that \nnetwork and provide information about A.Q. Khan to other \nnations. And we now know that he was providing nuclear \ntechnology and information to Libya, Iran, and North Korea.\n    At the NDU speech that the President gave, he proposed \nspecific measures to take to strengthen the world's efforts \nagainst networks such as A.Q. Khan's and others who would \nproliferate weapons of mass destruction knowledge and \ntechnologies around the world. We are hard at work on that. We \nhave seen results.\n    We can be very proud, Mr. Chairman and members of the \ncommittee, of the fact that as a result of U.S. and U.K. \nefforts, Libya came to a conclusion, as they looked around the \nworld, they saw that the United States and coalition partners \nwere ready to take action against nations such as Iraq. But I \nthink Libya did more than that. They looked and said: ``We have \nspent millions and millions of dollars to acquire the \nwherewithal to perhaps someday acquire a nuclear weapon. We \nhave spent millions and millions of dollars to produce chemical \nweapons. We have looked into biological weapons technology. \nWhat has it gotten us? It has made us a pariah on the face of \nthe Earth. Nobody will deal with us. Nobody will invest in us. \nNobody will come here. What we have seen is nothing but \nsupporters of terrorism and procurers of weapons of mass \ndestruction. What has it done for us? Has it made us safer? No. \nMade us more secure? No. Fixed our health care system? No. Made \nus more able to participate in the 21st century economy? No.''\n    And so Colonel Qaddafi decided this was the wrong way to \ngo, and he got in touch with us and our friends from the United \nKingdom. An arrangement was worked out, and you know the rest. \nHe is cooperating fully in giving up these programs. Much of \nthe material that he acquired is being sent back out of the \ncountry. We have possession of quite a bit of it, and we \nlearned a great deal about A.Q. Khan and the other \nproliferators in the world. And we hope that this will be a \nsignal to other countries around the world that it is fool's \ngold, it is ridiculous to invest in these kinds of \ntechnologies, because you will not scare the United States of \nAmerica, you will not scare our coalition partners. All you are \ndoing is denying yourselves the opportunity for a better \nrelationship with the United States and with the rest of the \ncivilized world.\n    Mr. Chairman, moving on, on Monday of this week, Ambassador \nTobias, Randy Tobias, who now heads up our global AIDS effort, \nSecretary Thompson, USAID Administrator Andrew Natsios, and I \nrolled out the strategy for the President's emergency plan for \nHIV/AIDS relief: $350 million in contracts to some of the NGO's \nand private organizations who will be carrying out the fight at \nthe grass-roots level. Making that announcement on Monday was a \nthrilling moment for me and the result of a lot of hard work on \nthe part of Secretary Thompson and Administrator Natsios and \nAmbassador Tobias and all of my colleagues in the State \nDepartment, and so many others.\n    With this program, the President has once again indicated \nhis commitment to go after one of the great, great threats to \ncivilization, and that is HIV/AIDS. Eight thousand people are \ndying every day as a result of HIV/AIDS, and we are going to do \nsomething about. It is a $15 billion program. It is dedicated \nto go after the source of this disease. It is also intended to \neducate people on how to protect themselves from the disease, \nand for those who have acquired the disease, to provide them \nwith the wherewithal to live a life that is still of a quality \nnature. It is going to help those who have been made orphans by \nthe disease. It is going to do everything we can to try to get \nthis disease under control and educate the world about the \nnature of this disease.\n    But it takes money, and we are very proud of the program \nthat we have put forward to the Congress. We are very proud \nthat the Congress has seen fit to support the first year of \nthis program, and I hope that it will support the program in \nthe years to come.\n    Another part of the President's agenda for the world has to \ndo with the Millennium Challenge Account, an account where we \nwill take American taxpayer dollars and make those dollars \navailable to developing nations, but in this instance, only \nthose developing nations that are committed to democracy, \ncommitted to the rule of law, committed to ending corruption, \ncommitted to market reforms and market economic policies. And \nwe are standing up that corporation, and I am Chairman of the \nBoard of Directors, and Mr. Paul Applegarth has just been \nnominated by the President to lead the corporation. We had our \nfirst board meeting not too long ago, at the beginning of this \nmonth, and we are ready to go to work. And we appreciate the \nCongress for the $1 billion it made available in this first \nyear.\n    Mr. Applegarth and Ambassador Tobias were over at my home \nthe other evening for a little supper. They are both sort of \nroad-running, as we say in the military. They are working here. \nTheir families are still at home in another part of the \ncountry. And we just sat and talked. The longer the three of us \ntalked, the more I could see the synergy that will exist \nbetween what each of them is doing, because they go together. \nDeveloping countries are doomed if they don't do something \nabout HIV/AIDS. And people who are suffering from HIV/AIDS are \ndoomed if their countries are not doing something about poverty \nalleviation and getting into the 21st century world with the \nrule of law and with the right kind of development policies.\n    And so these two programs will reinforce one another and \nare essential parts of the President's strategy for moving \nforward. They take money, but it is money well spent. And it \nshows America's commitment to the developing world, especially \nthe developing world in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n    There are so many programs like that in the budget that we \nare asking you to support. It does reflect an increase. It is \none of the most significant increases, as Senator Conrad noted, \nin the discretionary part of the budget. But, you know, we \nreally are in the front lines of foreign policy with our \nprograms. USAID, the diplomats that are doing such a great job \naround the world, they are in the front line of foreign policy. \nThey are the ones that are carrying our value system out to the \nrest of the world. They subject themselves to the kinds of \ndangers that their military colleagues do. Whether it is \nAmbassador Jim Foley in Haiti today, who is facing a difficult \nsituation or the other Ambassadors that have passed through my \noffice recently. Our Ambassador to Georgia helped the Georgian \npeople through a crisis last November when the a President \nstepped down. He helped create circumstances, working the new \nleadership of Georgia, so that a new democratically elected \nPresident could take office. And that President with President \nBush the other day. Or our Ambassador in Liberia, who was faced \nwith a very difficult situation last year as people were firing \nat his embassy, as dead bodies were being placed before the \nembassy.\n    But we worked with the Liberians. We worked our way through \nthat. And now Liberia is on a path hopefully to peace and \nstability. We had a donors' conference at the U.N. a few weeks \nago and we raised $500 million for Liberia. It was American \npolitical activity, a little bit of American military strength, \nAmerican support for regional solutions, American support for a \npolitical compromise that showed us the way forward.\n    I could go to country after country around the world where \nour wonderful diplomats, working alongside so many other great \nAmericans from all of the agencies of government work hard to \nserve the interests of the American people. And so when you \nsupport our budget, you are supporting that kind of effort, and \nyou are bringing reconciliation and peace to places like Libya, \nIraq, Georgia, Liberia. We are working hard in Haiti today to \ntry to find a solution to that difficult problem.\n    Our diplomats are hard at work in Beijing today with the \nNorth Koreans, the Chinese, and the South Koreans, the \nJapanese, and the Russians, and the results of the first 2 days \nof meetings are positive. There is a positive attitude. There \nis a promising attitude that is emerging from those meetings, \nand hopefully we can move in the right direction there.\n    Diplomacy tends not to be something that happens overnight. \nYou don't see your successes right away. You see day after day \nafter day after day failure, and then suddenly you get a \nbreakthrough. And that kind of dogged, determined work is what \nthe Department is all about. Because of what you did for us \nover the last several years, we have tens of thousands of \nAmerican youngsters wanting to be a part of this Department. \nThirty thousand people are year now are signing up to join the \nForeign Service. They want to be a part of America's team on \nthe front line of foreign policy. And it is because you have \nsaid we are going to invest in information technology, we are \ngoing to invest in the benefits that you deserve for going out \nand serving your Nation. Well, they are responding, and they \nare serving their Nation.\n    So, in conclusion, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, \nlet me just say keep supporting us because I think you are \ngetting a hell of a return on the investment that the American \npeople place in our international affairs accounts. And I \npromise you that as long as I am there with my team--Deputy \nSecretary Armitage and Under Secretary Grant Green and all the \nothers, and Administrator Natsios--we will be good stewards of \nthe people's treasure. I am not spending my money. I am \nspending American taxpayer money. And I know that we also have \nto go in debt to finance some of our activities right now. We \nare all sensitive to that. We are all doing what we can to give \nyou the best return on your investment, and we are all working \nwith the President to get the deficit down and to put the \nNation on the kind of balanced financial footing that Senator \nConrad spoke to earlier.\n    Mr. Chairman, I will just stop at this point and be \navailable for your questions.\n    Chairman Nickles. Mr. Chairman, thank you for your opening \nstatement. We have several colleagues. Let me make sure that \nall of our colleagues are aware of the fact that we plan on \nmarking up the budget next Wednesday and Thursday. It is my \nintention to submit a budget document to markup on Wednesday \nand I expect to mark it up on Thursday. So you might expect--if \nwe maintain our tradition, Thursday could be a rather long day. \nMaybe it won't be. Maybe it will be very short. But I wanted to \nmake sure that everybody is aware of that and notified of that.\n    Mr. Secretary, two or three very quick little comments. And \nI am going to ask all of our colleagues, the Secretary needs to \nbe out by noon, and if we can all keep our comments close to 7 \nor 8 minutes, I think we can accommodate that request.\n    You mentioned the President of Macedonia unfortunately was \nkilled. I happened to know him as well. I haven't heard. Was \nthat an accident?\n    Secretary Powell. It appears to have been an accident, \nflying in mountainous terrain in bad weather.\n    Chairman Nickles. That is very difficult terrain. I hate to \nsee that happen because he was really leading that country in \nthe right direction.\n    Just a couple of other comments. You mentioned now that the \nU.N. is cooperating with us much more in Iraq. I am concerned. \nWhen there was an unfortunate bombing incident right outside \ntheir headquarters, the next thing we know, the U.N. was \npulling out. We have shown great leadership, and I compliment \nyou, I compliment the President, I compliment Ambassador Bremer \nand others. I have a staff member that is working over there. A \nlot of us have--all of us have constituents that are serving \nover there. But I am always questioning sometimes the UN's \nresolve, and maybe that is just an editorial comment and I am \nnot asking you to respond to it. But I am concerned.\n    You mentioned it was a noble cause. It is that and more. I \nlook at what this administration has done in Afghanistan and in \nIraq, and I look at it as a liberation. As you mentioned, the \nwomen in Iraq now have freedoms that they did not enjoy before, \ntheir country was liberated.\n    I object to the term ``occupation.'' We are planning on \nleaving. Correct me if I am wrong.\n    Secretary Powell. Absolutely.\n    Chairman Nickles. And so we are in the process of trying to \nexpedite turning over total government control to the Iraqi \npeople in a systematic way as soon as possible. It is a \nliberation. I would encourage your people maybe to use that \nword.\n    One other comment. You mentioned Mr. Khan and the fact that \nhe had distributed nuclear secrets. I don't see him being \npunished, and I am concerned. This individual evidently was \nspreading nuclear secrets throughout the world to, as you \nmentioned, North Korea and Iran and Libya. It looks like he is \ngetting off scot-free, and I am interested in your comment on \nthat.\n    Secretary Powell. Very quickly, with respect to the United \nNations, after the bombing last year that killed Sergio de \nMello and so many others, the Secretary General had to take \nstock of the security situation. They are not soldiers. They \ndon't have a green zone. They have to be out where they can do \ntheir work. And they had to withdraw in order to assess \nsecurity and figure out how they could do their work.\n    I think we have demonstrated to the U.N. that the situation \nis improving, and we want to work closely with them on making \nsure that they can do their work in relatively safe conditions. \nYou can never guarantee safety. Casualties are occurring every \nday.\n    The U.N. has started to come back. Mr. Ross Mountain, a New \nZealander, is in charge of humanitarian efforts of the U.N. For \nthe most part, they are trying to headquarter these efforts \nfrom nearby countries, thereby reducing their vulnerability. \nBut I expect their efforts to grow in the weeks and months \nahead.\n    We were able to arrange security for Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, \nwhen he went in. And we are in constant touch with the \nSecretary General because after 1 July, we expect an even \ngreater U.N. presence getting ready for the elections at the \nend of the year or some time next year, whenever they occur.\n    And so we are working closely with the U.N. They have to \nhave some level of confidence in security before they can put \ntheir people into dangerous situations. But they are anxious to \nplay the vital role that the President has anticipated they \nwould play.\n    With respect to A.Q. Khan, as you know, Senator, he was \nseen as a national hero in Pakistan, and he occupies a special \nplace in the life of the Pakistani people. President Musharraf \nis well aware of what Mr. Khan has been doing. I have had many \nconversations with President Musharraf about this. I think he \ntook a bold step, the right step to uncover it all and not hide \nfrom the reality of what A.Q. Khan had done. And he got from \nMr. Khan full acknowledgment of what he had done and a lot of \ninformation. And then President Musharraf felt it was in the \nbest interest of his country and of his government and of the \nprocess of uncovering everything we could about this network \nfor him to give a conditional amnesty to Mr. Khan.\n    Chairman Nickles. Did he cooperate?\n    Secretary Powell. He was cooperating.\n    Chairman Nickles. Did Khan cooperate with Musharraf as far \nas saying here is what I did, here is where the information was \ngoing?\n    Secretary Powell. Yes. Dr. Khan cooperated with President \nMusharraf and with the Pakistani investigators who were pulling \nall of this up, with assistance from us because we had quite a \nbit of information we could provide to them. So we are getting \na lot of information out of Dr. Khan's openness, and I expect \nwe will get a lot more as well. And it is important to note \nthat the amnesty he was given is a conditional one, meaning he \nhas to meet the conditions of the amnesty, which means full and \nopen disclosure. And we are learning a lot from that.\n    Chairman Nickles. Thank you. One other comment. You \nmentioned about 48 percent of your budget is directed toward \nfighting terrorism for international security and so on. You \nalso mentioned the terrorist attacks. Some people have said \nthat your speech before the U.N. was hyped, that our going into \nIraq was hyped or inflated or misled. I have heard some people \nsay that we are misled into going into Iraq--or lied to, some \npeople use that term.\n    I looked at a speech that President Clinton gave in 1998, I \nthink it was made to the Pentagon, and he said something like, \n``Now, let's imagine the future. What if he fails to comply?'' \nAnd he is talking about Saddam Hussein. ``If we fail to act or \nwe take some ambiguous third route, which gives him more \nopportunities to develop programs of weapons of mass \ndestruction, and he continued to press for release of \nsanctions, continuing to ignore the solemn commitments he has \nmade. Well, then he will conclude the international community \nhas lost its will, he will conclude that he can go right on and \ndo more to rebuild an arsenal of devastating destruction, and \nsomeday, some way, I guarantee you he will use the arsenal.''\n    That was President Clinton. That was made in 1998. That was \nmade in February 1998.\n    I might mention we had two embassies that were bombed later \nthat summer in Africa, killed a couple hundred people, all \nemployees of the United States, some U.S. citizens.\n    I am offended when people use words like ``deliberately \nmisled.'' I happen to know you well, and you are my friend. And \nPresident Bush is my friend. And this is serious. When people \nmake allegations of being lied to or misled leading up to this \nwar, I am offended by it.\n    You have been brought into it because of your excellent \nspeech, I might say, before the United Nations a year ago--was \nthat a year ago?\n    Secretary Powell. 5 February last year.\n    Chairman Nickles. It was about a year ago. Anyway, any \ncomment on that?\n    Secretary Powell. Yes. Let me say, Mr. Chairman, that \nPresident Clinton's statements and his actions during his \nPresidency, to include Operation Desert Fox, which involved the \nbombing of weapons of mass destruction facilities in Iraq in \n1998, was based on the best intelligence that he had at that \ntime. And it was a consistent picture that the intelligence \ncommunity was giving us over time through his administration \nand into President Bush's administration which was that Saddam \nHussein had never lost the intent to have such weapons, that he \nkept in place the infrastructure for such weapons. There was no \ndoubt that if he was ever relieved of the pressure of \nsanctions, he would explode his capability and show it to the \nworld again. He had used them before; he had used them against \nhis own people; he had used them against his neighbors. And we \nbelieved, as President Clinton did, we believed that there was \na stockpile of these weapons.\n    When I went before the United Nations last 5 February, I \nknew very well that I was representing the views of the \nAmerican Government to the entire world. And I wasn't going to \ngo hype anything or overstate anything. I wasn't going to \nshort-sell anything either. And I spent 4 days and nights out \nat the CIA with Director Tenet and with Deputy Director \nMcLaughlin and with all their experts going over that \npresentation. And there wasn't a word in that presentation that \nwasn't the considered judgment of the intelligence community. \nNot everybody agreed with every single fact or finding, but it \nwas the considered judgment of the intelligence community, and \nit represented the judgment of the Director of Central \nIntelligence. And it was based on the evidence that was \navailable to us, not cooked. The analysts were in the room with \nus when we made those judgments and wrote that speech.\n    And so if you look at it in retrospect, it did reflect the \nconsidered judgment not only of our intelligence services, but \nof the United Kingdom and most intelligence services that had \nlooked at it. Any prudent person receiving the intelligence \nthat I did or the President did, Prime Minister Blair, Prime \nMinister Aznar, Prime Minister Berlusconi, Prime Minister \nHoward, and so many others did, would have come to the same \nconclusion. This is a regime that had not given up these \nprograms, had the intent, had the capability, was working on \nthe delivery means, had done it before, was desperately trying \nto hide it, was desperately trying to get out of the sanctions \nthat had kept it somewhat constrained. And you could reach the \nconclusion based on what the intelligence community had that \nthere were stockpiles of such weapons.\n    Now, the stockpiles are the only thing in my mind that is \nan issue. Dr. Kay, when he went in to start looking for this \nlast year, thought there were stockpiles. He has now come to \nthe conclusion that stockpiles are not there.\n    Mr. Dulfer, who has gone in to replace him, will continue \nthe work, look at additional sites, look at the documentation, \ninterrogate people to see if more can be found out. But it \nseems to me that is the area that is in judgment. But nobody \nmade up the information last year. It reflected the best \njudgment of the best people we have who were going about this \ntrying to find the truth, not to hide the truth or to cook the \nbooks.\n    And so I stand behind what the intelligence community gave \nus as Director Tenet stands behind what he gave us. As new \ninformation comes forward which puts into question old \ninformation, let's examine it. If mistakes were made, let's \nfind out what those mistakes were and fix our process going \nforward.\n    Chairman Nickles. Mr. Secretary, thank you very much.\n    Looking at the number of colleagues, again, I am going to \nask all my colleagues to try and keep it pretty close to 7 or 8 \nminutes. Senator Conrad."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Mr. Secretary, you are a forceful advocate of important \nwork that needs to be done in the war on terrorism and the \nglobal fight on AIDS. You are asking here for a 16-percent \nincrease. The question for this committee is how to pay for it. \nHow to pay for it.\n    Are these increases so important that they should be paid \nfor by cutting spending in other areas or by raising taxes? \nBecause I think the answer of just borrowing more money is \nreally no longer an option. We have record deficits now, and we \nare not going to have the deficit cut in half, as the President \nhas said. That I think is utterly outside the question when one \nlooks at the hard reality of where this is all headed.\n    So I would ask you: Are these priorities so important that \nyou would advocate cutting spending in other areas--and if so, \nwhere?--or raising taxes to pay for them?\n    Secretary Powell. I believe these are important priorities. \nAs the President put his budget together, all of us had to \ncompete our programs. In recognition of the finite resources \navailable to the Nation, the President was strict in his \nguidance to us. OMB was strict in their application of that \nguidance, and so our programs competed with other discretionary \nspending and with the Defense Department's needs.\n    My figures suggest that we are 7.1 percent above 2004, \nincluding the supplemental, 2004 actual to 2005, 7.1 percent. I \nthink it is a reasonable amount for the kinds of challenges we \nare facing on the war on terrorism, standing up new facilities \nin Iraq, and all that we are being asked to do on the war \nagainst HIV/AIDS and the Millennium Challenge Account.\n    Now, it is always a question as to am I taking spending \nfrom someone else or am I just asking for the debt ceiling to \nbe raised or am I asking for new taxes? I think that is a \njudgment that the President has to make in consultation with \nthe Congress, and the Congress ultimately answers that question \nin the manner in which they act on the President's budget. But \nwhat we try to do is put forward only those priorities that we \nfelt were essential and were deserving of additional spending \nin 2005, Senator."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Let me put up this Newsweek article that I \nquoted from earlier. ``The greatest threat to America's primacy \nin the world comes not from its overseas commitments, explains \nhistorian Niall Ferguson. It is the result of America's \nchronically unbalanced domestic finances. The mounting Federal \nbudget deficits that now stretch out as far as the eye can see \nwill mean, if history is any guide, sharp cutbacks in American \nmilitary and foreign affairs spending. We will see a forced \nretreat of America's foreign policy similar to the years after \nthe Vietnam War, only the cuts are likely to be much, much \ndeeper and the resulting chaos far greater.''"
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Secretary Powell. Well, I don't know that I can agree with \neither Professor Ferguson or my good friend who I admire, \nFareed Zakaria. America's primacy in the world is unchallenged \ntoday, and it will be unchallenged in the future. I think \npeople recognize that America does have some budget \ndifficulties, but they also have confidence in the American \npolitical system and the American economic system to deal with \nthis over a period of time--maybe not in a year or two. And it \nis unfortunate we have gone from a surplus to a deficit \nsituation, but we had emergencies thrust upon us. And we have \nto work our way through this. And the President made judgments \nwith respect to tax cuts, with respect to his economic plan, \nwith respect to how much deficit we could sustain right now and \nhow to get out of that deficit position. And I don't think it \nis undercutting our position in the world, and right now we \nhave demonstrated to the world that we will not shrink back \nfrom our responsibilities to go after terrorists and we will \nnot shrink back from our obligations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n    I don't see anybody coming to my office saying we are \nworried about you guys losing your primacy in the world. We \nwill remain the primary actor in the world, the sole \nsuperpower--not a superpower that imposes but a superpower that \nlooks for allies and partnerships.\n    So I don't quite come to the same conclusion that Niall did \nor Fareed did."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Let me just say to you, I have not come to \nyour office, but I will tell you, I have looked at the long-\nterm projections the President has made, not just the next 5 \nyears but his long-term projections of what happens with his \nproposed tax cuts and the increased cost as a result of the \nretirement of the baby-boom generation. We saw yesterday the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve tell us those imbalances are so \ngreat that we have to cut Social Security.\n    Now, you know, the explanation that somehow it is all just \ngoing to work out is becoming an increasingly hollow \nexplanation. I don't think it squares with the facts that we \nsee before us, either in the immediate term or in the term \nbeyond the 5-year budget window. And that is why people like \nMr. Zakaria, who is, I think, in many ways an ally of yours on \nmany issues, and a noted historian are warning us--are warning \nus--where this all leads. And it leads to incredibly serious \nchoices in the years ahead. It will be very hard to see how \ninternational affairs will be exempt from substantial cuts, and \neven defense.\n    I would be happy to have you respond to that if you would \ncare to.\n    Secretary Powell. Well, I think I have, Senator. I am not \ncompetent to judge what needs to be done or not done with \nrespect to Social Security. I do know that the country has \nvital needs now with respect to international affairs and \ndefense expenditures. I do know that the challenges we are now \nfacing were thrust upon us at the beginning of 2001, and we are \nresponding to it. And it has put a great deal of pressure on \nour Federal budget, causing the deficit.\n    And I know that there is debate about the President's tax \ncuts, but he is confident that the tax cuts will lead to \neconomic growth which will benefit the American people, and he \nhas a plan. And you may disagree with the plan and believe that \nit is unachievable, but, nevertheless, it is the plan that he \nwas submitted to the Congress that he believes will halve the \nbudget in the period of years that you indicated earlier. And \nthat is a debate that the Congress, of course, will have in the \ncourse of the year with the President."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Let me just say in conclusion, I think the \nnotion that the President has floated that this is going to cut \nthe deficit in half is entirely a fiction--entirely a fiction. \nI mean, I am surprised he didn't say it was going to eliminate \nthe deficit, just leave our some more things. But when you \nleave out the costs of the war past the end of September, when \nyou leave out the crisis with the alternative minimum tax, when \nyou leave out the $2.4 trillion he is borrowing from the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund, every penny of which he has got to pay \nback--he has no plan to do so--it leads people like the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve to conclude that you are going \nto have to cut Social Security, and much else as well.\n    So I would say to you I have enormous respect for you. But \nthe policy of just continuing to increase expenditures and \nborrow the money I don't think stands up. And we are going to \nhave to do much better.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Conrad, thank you very much. I \nhope to have a budget next week that will cut the deficit in \nhalf, and it will be real.\n    Senator Gregg?\n    Senator Gregg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I will be happy \nto debate Senator Conrad on his points in the future because I \ndisagree with them. But today we are here with the Secretary of \nState, who has been a leader in what is one of the--what is the \ntrue issue that faces our country, which is that we are at war, \nand that whether we like it or not, there is a culture out \nthere whose purpose it is to destroy our culture. And they have \nalready shown that they are willing to kill innocent men and \nwomen to do it. And if they get their hands on a weapon of mass \ndestruction, they will use it against us, whether it is \nbiological or chemical, and they will kill thousands more \nAmericans. And our purpose must be to defeat them, to find \nthem, to chase them around the globe.\n    And I admire the fact that this President has been myopic \nin his efforts to pursue that course, and I admire the fact \nthat he has surrounded himself with people who understand the \nthreat and who are also equally committed to defeating them.\n    I think if we look at the track record of this \nadministration, it is really rather extraordinary in this \nfight. If you look at what we have done in Afghanistan, in \nIraq, if you look at what is happening in Libya, North Korea is \nstarting to move, it appears, Iran has opened itself up to \nreview of its nuclear programs--these are extraordinary steps \nin the right direction, and they are steps which are a function \nof the fact that we have shown strength and commitment.\n    I can see scenarios where we would have still been debating \nwith the Taliban as to whether or not we would have gone in \nthere under other administrations, and we didn't take that \ncourse. So I congratulate the administration and the Secretary \nof State for their aggressiveness in this fight, because that \nis what it takes.\n    It also takes a strong State Department, and I appreciate \nthe Secretary making the point that we as a Congress have stood \nby the efforts with the DRI program, with the IT program, with \nthe embassy security program, with the visa/passport program, \nso hopefully the subcommittee that funds them is not a national \nsecurity risk. But there are some specific concerns I have \nwhich are tangential to the larger issues, but which I would \nlike to raise with the Secretary because our time is limited.\n    The first is Charles Taylor. Not many people focus on \nCharles Taylor. I have been focusing on him for a long time, \never since his horrific actions and the genocide he created in \nSierra Leone.\n    The tribunal in Sierra Leone has indicted him as their \nfirst act. It was a courageous act when the indicted him. It \nwas led by an American prosecutor. I think his name is Thomas, \nalthough I am not sure. And now that they have indicted him and \nTaylor has been forced out of his country, it appears that we \ncannot get him before the court. And he should come to Sierra \nLeone and be tried. He should be brought there and tried.\n    This Congress has put a bounty on the effort to try to get \nhim to Sierra Leone and try him, because if we don't try him in \nSierra Leone, no future tribunal that is structured on the \nissue of genocide, whether it is Rwanda or what is happening in \nthe Congo, is going to have legitimacy. This man cannot be \nallowed to live under the aegis of a foreign country and be \ngiven that protection.\n    I am just wondering what the State Department's position is \non getting him to Sierra Leone to be tried.\n    Secretary Powell. We believe he should be tried. We believe \nthat ultimately he will be brought to justice before the \ntribunal.\n    We had a challenge last year. We had a rapidly \ndeteriorating situation in Liberia. The people were suffering \nbadly--starvation, we had mobs running around. We had different \nresistance groups terrorizing the people. And we had to find a \nsolution to all of that that would bring the situation under \ncontrol and get rid of the leadership that was there, namely, \nPresident Charles Taylor.\n    And after working with our friends in ECOWAS, the Economic \nCommunity of Western African States, we came up with a solution \nthat would get Charles Taylor out of power, out of the country, \nbut the only way we could arrange that to happen was to put him \nin a country where he would not be immediately subject to the \ntribunal and he would not be moved from that country to the \ntribunal.\n    It wasn't a perfect arrangement. We would have preferred \nanother arrangement. But we had to deal with a real emergency \nat that time. And so it was an arrangement that was entered \ninto by ECOWAS and we supported it. And as a result, Charles \nTaylor is no longer in power. He is no longer protected by his \ngoons, and the Liberian people are heading toward a better \nfuture. He went to Nigeria, the country that was willing to \nhost him as long as we didn't put pressure on Nigeria to \nimmediately turn him over to a court. We made it clear that we \nbelieve he is still subject to that tribunal. We made it clear \nthat we believe this is still a matter between him and that \ntribunal. And we hope and we work for a set of circumstances to \ncome about where it will be possible to turn him over to the \ncourt and put him before the court.\n    Senator Gregg. Well, as you know, the----\n    Secretary Powell. But for the moment, I am obliged to \nrespect the political arrangement that was entered into which \ngot him out of the place, out of Monrovia in the first place.\n    Senator Gregg. I would hope that we have been generous \nenough to Mr. Taylor. It is time for him to be brought before \nthe court. I think we should not be standing in the way of \nthat, but I think we are.\n    On another issue, which is really tangential, and which I \nsuspect you have not focused on, and that is the security of \nthe families of our--I know you have focused on the security of \nour families abroad. This has also been a priority of mine, but \nI now learn that the State Department has taken a position that \nif you go to an American school which is not receiving grants \nfrom the State Department, that that school will not be able to \naccess the security funds which we put in the budget last year, \nand which you were kind enough to actually suggest an increase \nin. Whether you are in an America school that gets grants from \nthe State Department or not get grants from the State \nDepartment, if a school is called an American school, it is a \ntarget unfortunately, and the whole purpose of these funds were \nto protect all Americans, especially families of State \nDepartment personnel overseas.\n    I am wondering why this policy was put in place. It seems \nto be counter to what the intent--I know it is counter to my \nintent when I put the money in. It seems to be counter to the \nlogic of the purpose of protecting these families.\n    Secretary Powell. I feel a very heavy obligation to protect \nnot only my embassy compounds, but places where families live, \nwhere they go for recreation, and especially where they send \ntheir children to school. I need to give you an answer for the \nrecord.\n    Senator Gregg. What I would really like you to do is change \nthe policy. It makes no sense on its face.\n    Secretary Powell. Sir, I will look at it----\n    Senator Gregg. After you have looked at it.\n    Secretary Powell. Let me look at it before I----\n    Senator Gregg. I agree."

I think it is extraordinary the progress \nthat has been made, as I mentioned earlier, in these core areas \nof our national security, especially obviously, Afghanistan and \nIraq. North Korea now appears to be moving, and Iran, and \nLibya, of course, and that is only a function of the fact that \nyou and the President have shown a very strong hand and been \nwilling to play it. Thank you.\n    Secretary Powell. Thank you, Senator.\n    Chairman Nickles. Mr. Gregg, thank you very much.\n    Information from our colleagues: we have roll call that is \nnow ongoing I think for about 5 minutes, just FYI.\n    Senator Stabenow."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Welcome, Mr. Secretary.\n    Secretary Powell. Thank you, Senator."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    First I would thank you for your service, \nand also say that I think it is good news that we have men and \nwomen wanting to be involved in foreign service, and coming to \nthe Department of State we need the best and the brightest \nserving in very difficult circumstances.\n    Two areas of question. First, because we are talking about \nthe budget, I want to focus on the budget and what our \npriorities and choices are. When we look at this budget right \nnow it is not complete. When we look at it in total we see a \nhole because there is not one penny for ongoing military or \nreconstruction efforts in Iraq, and I might just mention that \nthe emergency supplemental we passed last year provided $18 \nbillion to rebuild Iraq, and as a side note, after yesterday's \ndiscussion on homeland security, that is four time more than \nwhat the President's budget is for first responders, which is \nof deep concern to me in terms of relative risk to us and what \nis happening to us in terms of a national threat.\n    But I am concerned that we are hearing rumors that there \nwill be a supplemental after the election. We are also hearing \nfrom many military leaders that this will not serve in terms of \nthe time limit; they need dollars ahead of time. If we are \nplanning to be in Iraq for many years, you have indicated it \nwill be very expensive, certainly very difficult. Why does the \nbudget not include some type of estimates for our operations \nand rebuilding in Iraq so we can budget intelligently for the \nfuture? We may not know exactly what the number is, Mr. \nSecretary, we know it is not zero.\n    Secretary Powell. Senator, the judgment was made that in \nthe course of regular 2004 funding and in the supplemental, we \nreceived enough money to carry us through the end of 2004 and \nwell into 2005, so that the best way to handle it was wait \nuntil we reached 2005, and then there will be a supplemental \nrequest in 2005. But there was not enough known about what that \nneed would be to include it in the 2005 budget submission, and \nwe have more than adequate funding to take us into at least \nfirst quarter, in my case, of 2005."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    Mr. Secretary, I realize that is the \nposition. I would just say that from our perspective on the \ncommittee, I do not believe that is responsible budgeting when \nwe know that our first quarter into the next year we will be \nasked to come back with a supplemental. We are already \nborrowing to spend in Iraq, and rebuilding as well as the \nmilitary, and for us to know that we are going to be going even \nfarther into debt, it seems to me we at least ought to have a \nplaceholder of an amount of money, and that is certainly \nsomething I think this committee should be discussing.\n    Secretary Powell. In my budget there are some moneys in \n2005 for things we really know about to a finite degree now, \nwhat it is going to cost us to run our embassy operations in \nIraq. Those kinds of things we have put in the 2005 submission."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    But you are agreeing that there will be \nadditional dollars needed in 2005?\n    Secretary Powell. I am quite sure there will be a need for \na supplemental in 2005."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    Let me turn to another issue, an \nextremely serious issue that you have talked about, which is \nHIV/AIDS. There is no question in my mind that this is one of \nthe, if not the, largest crisis that we have in the world \ncommunity. When you say 8,000 people are dying every day, \nincluding today as we sit here, I cannot imagine a bigger \nthreat to humanity than HIV/AIDS. The President's request to \ncombat HIV/AIDS increased substantially this year to 2.8 \nbillion, and I appreciate that, but I am concerned that the \nrequest lags behind the 3 billion that we authorized in \nlegislation last year, which the President signed, and I am \nwondering if you can explain why we are not meeting the \ncommitment that we made to the world community last year.\n    Secretary Powell. We are really still gearing up our \nprograms. The HIV/AIDS Office is now just starting to issue \ncontracts, enter into compacts with delivering agencies for the \nnew moneys coming from the 2004 appropriations. So I think you \nwill see that in the months ahead the rate of commitment of \nmoney will increase significantly and the funds will really \nstart to flow out in a very, very rapid and responsible way."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    Would you not agree that this is an \nemergency?\n    Secretary Powell. Ma'am, it is."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    And there has to be the utmost sense of \nurgency.\n    Secretary Powell. It has the utmost sense of urgency. It is \nan emergency. It is a priority, and we are working as hard as \nwe can, but we have to do it in a responsible way and make sure \nwe are sending money out to programs that are prepared to \nreceive the money, and we are not wasting the money, and that \nhas taken us time to buildup the capacity to handle the \nadditional moneys and to make sure we are doing it in a good \nway so that when I come up here next year, I am not criticized \nfor having run bad programs."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    Mr. Secretary, I have heard from a number \nof people and had a number of conversations with members of \nNGO's that indicate that as fast as we can get them the \nresources they have the capacity to address this, and I am \nhopeful that we will do this as quickly as possible.\n    Finally, this year's request for the Millennium Challenge \nAccount is 2.5 billion, nearly 1 billion short of the \ncommitment outlined by the administration at the onset of the \nMCAs. I understand it is a new program also. I understand it \ntakes time to ramp up, but we need assurance from the \nadministration that we will meet the $5 billion annual funding \ngoal in year 3 that was promised, and I am very concerned again \nthat things just are not moving as fast as they should be.\n    Secretary Powell. The President remains committed to \nreaching that $5 billion goal, and it is a brand new \ncorporation. The first board of directors meeting I held on the \n2nd of February. So inevitably it takes time to create \nprograms, to get the criteria in place. Working with our \nAmbassadors, we now have their ideas in hand. We are evaluating \nthe countries now. The evaluation system is being put in place, \nand you will see this program ramp up quickly. It just takes \ntime, frankly, to put in place a system to spend these large \namounts of money in a responsible way. But we will be ramping \nup quickly. I think we will be able to use what we have been \ngiven this year, and we will be able to use the $2-1/2 billion \nfor 2005, and the President is still committed to hit the $5 \nbillion a year target that he indicated when he created the \nprogram."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    Finally, one of the things I noticed in \nreading former Secretary O'Neill's book--and there were many \ninteresting things in that book--but one of the things that I \nwas appreciative of was his passion about HIV/AIDS after his \ntrips to Africa and his suggestions about water projects, and \nthe fact that only, as an example, half the people in Ghana \nhave water, and what a difference it would make just providing \nthe basics of water to everyone and how this could be done from \nhis analysis, looking at the major reports and some of the \ncontractors that have come in from the U.S. that have been \nsuggesting huge projects of billions of dollars. His assessment \nwas that things could be done for much, much less and much more \nquickly if we just talked about the basics and about wells and \ngetting water to people in these countries. I am wondering if \nyou have had conversations with him about his proposals? And I \nshould also say I am hopeful he will continue to work on those, \nbecause I think he has the right idea.\n    Secretary Powell. Paul had a real passion for that, HIV/\nAIDS and clean water, and he and I spent many hours talking \nabout both subjects. He had an idea about drilling wells \nrapidly, but we really do have a rather expansive program for \nwells and for other means of providing water, and we made \nanother substantial commitment when I went to the World Summit \non Sustainable Development in South Africa a year, year and a \nhalf ago. So we are I think as passionate and as committed as \nPaul O'Neill was for providing clean water because it goes \nalong with development and it goes along with health, it goes \nalong with combatting HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, \nso it is all part of the package. We may have had disagreements \nas to how best to provide clean water. It is not just a matter \nof digging a hole in the ground and up comes the water. You \nneed other parts of that system. You need to be able to \nmaintain and sustain that system over time.\n    So we were looking at it in a more comprehensive way than \nPaul was looking at it. I hope he will continue to have an \ninterest in this in private life, continue to work on both HIV/\nAIDS programs and clean water programs."
"stabenow","Senator Stabenow","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    Mr. Secretary, I just cannot find the \nwords strong enough to urge you to continue to focus on this as \nwell as all of us needing to do that, because there cannot be a \nlarger crisis right now in the world, and while we focus on \nmilitary action, which is certainly an important component to \nleadership, focusing on hearts and minds and the leadership \nthat we can provide as the greatest country in the world on \nhumanitarian efforts, certainly sends an important message \nabout our values as much as other actions.\n    Secretary Powell. I could not agree with you more, Senator. \nThank you.\n    Mr. Secretary, I am not sure that I can finish in the 3-\nminutes that remains on the vote, so if I come back, please do \nnot consider that I am trying to abuse my time. It is just that \nI am not going to get 8 minutes in, I do not believe.\n    First I want to tell you that I have a statement prepared \nthat I want to put in the record. It is a statement of \naccolades, accolades for you, for our President, for America, \nwith reference to the world, and principally with reference to \nwhat it means to be free."
break,break,break,break
"","","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    Senator Domenici. But I have an issue that I am quite sure \nyou agree is important, and I think it is so important that it \nrequires more than people like you being interested. It \nrequires the utmost action. Let me try to explain it to you in \nterms of what is happening today.\n    We are engaged in a war against Iraq on the basis that they \nhave historically been leaders in the use of weapons in mass \ndestruction. Whether they were there on a given day or not will \nprobably not be answered until history is beyond us. But we \nworried enough about it that we went to war.\n    Now, Mr. Secretary, the problem I address is the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and its components \nand its scientists around the world. When I first got involved \nin this issue, Mr. Secretary, it was Russia and America, and \nbelieve it or not, from that interest and the interest of some \nvery expert people, the first laws were passed with reference \nto proliferation. Believe it or not, one afternoon in a 15-\nminute period, the appropriators here started two new \nnonprofileration programs. We did not take a month or 6 months. \nOne was $200 million to jump start the program to create a \nplutonium disposition program. I am tempted to stop and go to \nthe other issue in a moment, but let me not do that and create \na little further synergy about the issue. On that very same day \nthat that happened, our Appropriations Committee, in \nconference, approved over 50 million for the United States of \nAmerica to buy highly enriched uranium from the Soviet Union. \nThat uranium acquisition has worked somewhat. We turned it over \nto an American corporation that was created by selling a \nGovernment corporation. You are aware of that company. Its \nrecord has been spotted at best.\n    But programs like plutonium disposition, you know, they are \na kind of a duck on water, and waiting around to drown, and you \nknow how hard it is to drown a duck. That is how hard it ought \nto be to dispose of a program like plutonium disposition, but \nwe are letting the problem languish to where it may disappear \nif we do not solve a little disagreement with Russia regarding \nwhat we in America would call indemnification. Maybe somebody \nwould describe it as who is going to be liable for what in the \nevent things do not work out.\n    Let me just say, Mr. Secretary, I have talked to you \nbriefly and I do not expect you to know a lot about this just \nbecause I called you on the phone, but I sent you a letter. I \nhave tried my best to speak to the President, and I think a \nresult of both the speech and a letter that had something to do \nwith the President's announcement. People do not know it, but \nthe announcement on nonproliferation, it may go down in history \nas one of the most significant speeches given if it works.\n    Mr. Secretary, I want to ask you and urge you, with all the \nthings you are carrying around on your shoulders, to really \nconsider pursuing with vigor the establishment of international \ninstitutions to control the spread of weapons of mass \ndestruction, and, Mr. Secretary, I have, since our \nconversation, talked to the smartest people I could find. The \nother day you asked me who and I told you, remember, Sig \nHecker? Since then I have spoken to Steve Younger, who is going \nto be a fellow after having been one of America's--leading \nnuclear bomb makers, and he is going to be a fellow and \nresearch physicist. I asked him about this. He said we have to \nget somebody to get on with it and get this international thing \ngoing.\n    Now, Mr. Secretary, do you think this is a big problem, \nproliferation?\n    Secretary Powell. I absolutely do, Senator, and that is why \nthe President spoke to the issue at the National Defense \nUniversity, a speech I think is an historic one, and one in \nwhich he laid out a number of things we have to be working on \nto include improving the ability of the major international \norganization that deals with nuclear activities and that is the \nIAEA. And he talked about passing resolutions before the U.N. \nHe talked about passing the additional protocols to the \nNonproliferation Treaty and a number of other areas that he is \nworking on.\n    With respect to the specific issue of liability and \nindemnification with the Russian Federation, it is a subject of \nconsiderable discussion. I have discussed it with my Russian \ncolleagues recently when I was in Moscow, and in subsequent \nconversations with Foreign Minister Ivanov. And we have engaged \nthe interagency process in recent weeks in a much more \naggressive way to find a solution to these continuing, nagging \nindemnification and liability problems that are holding up not \njust the particular program you made reference to, but other \nprograms that came out of the G-8.\n    Senator Domenici. Mr. Secretary, I am thrilled to know that \nyou are involved. I can tell you without mentioning names that \nI believe that people who have been working in your behalf--and \nI would not mention their names--I do not think they are \ncompetent to get this kind of treaty with the Russians. That is \nmy view, not yours. To get that resolved needs your absolute \nmandate to the State Department that they put the kind of \npeople in that can resolve it. I tell you, it is not that \ntough, but it has got to have some big people.\n    I want to wrap this meeting up so that everybody that is \nhere and the media that is here have to understand. We just had \na national position, and our ranking member took a big swipe at \nthe fact that America has gotten heavily in debt, and that the \nFed Chairman just mentioned Social Security. Well, Mr. \nChairman, and fellow Senators, I was chairman for so long in \nthis committee, and I am so thrilled that this very, very \ncompetent man, Senator Nickles, is Chairman.\n    But do you know, 18 years ago in the U.S. Senate we had a \nvote. Do you remember former Senator Pete Wilson? We wheeled \nPete Wilson in in a wheelchair because he had had appendicitis. \nHis was the deciding vote on a proposal by Domenici and Nunn to \nrestrain the COLAs on Social Security, 18 years ago. Why? We \nknew just what is happening was going to happen. We never did \nthis again because some people think 8 or 10 people lost \nelections the next time, but from my standpoint I do not think \nit does a lot of good to talk about this unless somebody is \nready to do something about it. But I can tell you, you have \nsome of the greatest programs mankind has ever seen, the \ngreatest humanitarian program was this President's effort of \ncommitment of $2.8 billion for AIDS. Who would have thought it? \nThere are still some people who think Republicans do not care \nand George Bush is a conservative from Texas, who cannot \nbelieve that he is the one who said we will spend 2.8 billion \nto address the world's aids crisis.\n    I tell you, I am not here to criticize how slow it has been \nbecause I understand with that much money, if you turn it \nloose, it will be gone in a year and then they will be back \nhere saying, you forgot this one, this one, the other one, or \nyou put too much here and too much there, and that is a bear of \na job. I hope you get it done and I hope you get it done in \nyour typical, methodical and terrific way. The man you put in \nthe directorship is already under criticism because he is not a \nhealth man. We do not need a health man. We need a big-time \nmanager, right?\n    Secretary Powell. Absolutely, and that is what we have with \nAmbassador Tobias.\n    Senator Domenici. That is right, terrific. If you put \nanybody in charge that is going to look at 3, 4, 5 billion and \nspend it right, you are probably on the right track.\n    My time is up and I am going to go vote, and I am not sure \nthat I can come back. I have about 8, 9 questions. I will \nsubmit them to you.\n    I do want to close by saying, as strange as it may seem, \nwith this President having 1 year left, and hopefully he will \nhave some more, it is very important that you, where you have \nthe lead in some of these programs, that you really put \nSecretary Colin Powell behind them. Nobody will move them like \nyou, and you ought to do it. The ones I mentioned are terrific. \nWeapons of mass destruction are moving around the world today \nlike nothing we could have believed. We have a guy in Pakistan \nthat 10 years ago if you would have found him selling that \nstuff, you would have hung him in the marketplace. The worst \nproliferator ever is that fellow from Pakistan. Is that his \nname, Khan?\n    Secretary Powell. Kahn, sir, Dr. Khan.\n    Senator Domenici. Can you imagine admitting that he put \nweapons of mass destruction in five countries, and we are still \nrunning around saying, well, we do not know what to do about \nhim?\n    Thank you very much.\n    Secretary Powell. Thank you, Senator.\none back, I will be the first one to be able to followup on \nSenator Domenici. I would like to comment on an earlier \nstatement by my good friend, the ranking member, about what \nChairman Greenspan said and what he did not say. I have his \nstatement before me. He stressed that he preferred cutting \nGovernment spending as much as possible before increasing \ntaxes. He also endorsed in the statement the tax cuts that we \nimplemented in the economic reform program, and then he \nsuggested that we might consider cutting promised Social \nSecurity, and the exact words, ``consider cutting promised \nSocial Security benefits to future retirees.'' He did not say \nto cut them. He did not say that that was an option. He said \n``you might consider it.''\n    Well, I have news for Alan Greenspan, and I have had it \nbefore at every hearing--I know I am getting off the track, but \nI have to say these things. Chairman Greenspan has made so many \nwrongheaded statements over the period of the last 15 years \nthat I have taken him to task at almost every meeting that he \nhas attended. Knowing full well that nobody in this Congress of \nthe United States of America is ever going to suggest that we \ncut Social Security benefits for those who have earned and paid \nfor them.\n    The fact of the matter is, as Chairman of the Social \nSecurity Subcommittee on the Ways and Means Committee, it was \nnever brought up. The only thing that was ever suggested that \nif we did nothing, nothing to correct the problem, that by 2036 \nwe would have to lower benefits to future beneficiaries after \nthat time by 25 percent. I wanted to clear that up because I \nthink it is very important.\n    Now to get to some of the things that concern me on your \nbudget. 9 percent increase for the U.N. and affiliated \nagencies. I bring that only to the point that does that \nconsider any of the military money that we are spending in \nBosnia or Kosovo with our troops, or is that excluding the \ndollars being spent by the DOD on our involvement in Bosnia and \nKosovo?\n    Secretary Powell. It excludes it. Those are strictly within \nthe military accounts. If it is a peacekeeping mission \nsomewhere under U.N. auspices, then we pay our fair share, 27 \npercent of that peacekeeping mission, and that would be \nincluded in that account.\n    Senator Bunning. But we are continuing to pay the 100 \npercent of our troops, our troop presence----\n    Secretary Powell. In Bosnia and Kosovo.\nyears and Kosovo for the last 5 years. So that is not in this \nbudget?\n    Secretary Powell. No.\n    Senator Bunning. I have a problem with the State Department \nonly to the point that we created a law in the U.S. Congress, \nand it passed and the President signed it on arming cargo \npilots to operate on international flights. It is called the \nFlight Deck Officers Law.\n    In an op-ed piece--and I do not recommend this for reading, \nop-ed piece in Roll Call, because it is not one of my favorite \nperiodicals--none are being allowed to do this because our \nState Department has not negotiated any agreements with any \nother nations to allow these armed pilots, whether it be on \ncommercial aircraft or cargo planes to carry these. Can you \nbring me up to speed as far as where the State Department is in \nany kind of negotiations with other countries on this specific \nlaw that we passed?\n    Secretary Powell. No. I would rather provide the answer for \nthe record, Senator. The only thing that I could say is that \nmany of our friends and allies around the world do not have the \nsame view of that approach to security, and therefore if we fly \ninto those countries, there is probably a debate that will take \nplace before we can get in place the necessary policies for our \npilots to come in armed. But I would rather get a more precise \nanswer for you for the record.\n    Senator Bunning. I appreciate that, because some of our \nintelligence, as you well know, indicates that that might be a \nsource of national security as far as returning to the United \nStates on cargo planes and on other planes that have been \nobviously canceled.\n    Secretary Powell. I do understand.\n    Senator Bunning. I thank you very much for your time, your \npatience, and my God, the responsibility that you hold as \nSecretary of State in this trying time with all of the things \nthat are on your plate, our expansion, our problems in Iraq, \nour problems in Afghanistan, and many other areas, and the \nprogress that we are making in those areas, and if at all \npossible, I will support almost everything in this budget, and \nwe will figure out a way to pay for it.\n    Secretary Powell. Thank you, Senator.\n    Senator Bunning. Thank you.\nvery much.\n    Senator Corzine?"
"corzine","Senator Corzine","stabenow","Senator Stabenow","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Welcome, Secretary. It is always great to welcome you, and \nI want to as well commend you for your service and particularly \nthose who work with you as well in the State Department. The \nagenda is broad and long, and I feel like we are in strong \nhands under your leadership there.\n    I also believe that the reinvesting in the people that you \nhave made such a centerpiece is one of the most important \nthings in the long run for our ability to be able to carry out \nour foreign policy, both current administration and future, and \nsupport it completely. That is the good news.\n    I have a real problem. It is a little bit along the lines \nof sometimes a lack of complete information ends up undermining \ncredibility. When we look at the budget this year with regard \nto what you are speaking to us about today, we are talking \nabout 31.5 billion. And we all know that there is a plug there \nfor reconstruction for additional aid that will accompany both \nour efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. It has been there for 2 \nyears, $18 billion last year and two odd years before. I do not \nunderstand how we cannot make some estimate, understanding that \nrational views know that is coming. And you put that into \nconjunction with other issues about the alternative minimum \ntax, which is left out or only put in for 1 year or the \nelements with regard to the cost of some of the programs that \nwere proposed in the state of the union message, like health \ninsurance. It gives people an unease about full disclosure. I \nthink actually the debate the Chairman talked about is less \nabout misleading and lying and more about whether there was \nfull presentation of the various interpretations of \nintelligence that came as we preceded the war. So I am very \ntroubled about those issues and this is a particularly \negregious example, that we will end up almost certainly having \na substantial expenditure that is not included in our \nprojections, and it leaves the American people with a false \nsense of, I think, what we are doing with regard to our \nbudgetary policies, and then some way undermines credibility of \npeople who I think are doing a terrific job and putting \nthemselves at risk and all the other things that are associated \nwith it.\n    I guess that is my statement. I would ask you to comment on \nthat, but more importantly, would like to hear some of your \nearly interpretations of the writing of your report or the \nfact-finding report. I think the end of this week, if I am not \nmistaken, there is supposed to be an implementation of the \nfundamental law or at least an announcement. Do we think we are \ngoing to meet that deadline? There are certainly discussions \nwith regard to whether June 30th is an appropriate timeframe \nfor proper electoral process. I heard some movement away from \nmaybe an election, although I do not want to put words in your \nmouth. It was left uncertain. I think nothing is more important \nwith regard to our budgetary indications of whether we are \ngoing to have the resources to actually help build an electoral \nprocess that is going to have the credibility should the United \nNations be presenting this. I really think that an exposition \nwith regard to some of this fact finding--and a very credible \nperson, Ambassador Brahimi, has certainly led the effort in \nAfghanistan in a way that I think almost everyone would argue \nhas been remarkable.\n    Secretary Powell. Thank you. Senator. With respect to the \n2005 submission we do have dollars in there for things that we \nreally can scope down and know what the requirement is going to \nbe. There is $46 million requested for State operations in \nIraq, including $17 million support cost and $29 million to \nstaffing. That is known now. We can budget for that and we can \nput it in the budget, which we did. But with respect to other \ndemands that might be placed on the Department, and frankly the \nlarger demands that will be placed upon the Defense Department, \nit was felt that as a result of the supplemental efforts and \nthe fact that there are other sources of money that will be \ncoming online, revenues for oil sales in Iraq, the donors \nconference that came up with a lot of money in Madrid a few \nmonths ago, that money will start to kick in and help with \nreconstruction and budget support for the new Iraqi Government.\n    For those reasons, it was felt that the 2004 regular \nappropriations, plus the supplemental appropriation, will take \nus through the early part of 2005. And we will have a better \nsense then of what additional moneys will be required with \nanother year of experience under our belt. It was felt it was \nbetter to wait for that 2005 supplemental to deal with that \nwhich we cannot see clearly now. That was the judgment that was \nmade. So we put in, in the Department, that which we could see \nclearly had a finite way to scope it, and we did not make \nestimates, nor did others make estimates for expenditures they \ncould not accurately make estimates for now."
"corzine","Senator Corzine","corzine","Senator Corzine","    Is there no contingency planning though of \nranges that are actually thought through with regard to \nassociated planning processes?\n    Secretary Powell. I do not know what the Pentagon might \nhave done, but most of the $21 billion was for reconstruction \nactivities and it is not yet clear what that will look like for \nthe latter part of 2005, but we have enough to carry us into \n2005 for our operations, both military, State Department and \nother operations, and that is why the judgment was made to wait \nuntil 2005 to see what kind of supplemental would be required \nfor 2005.\n    With respect to Mr. Brahimi, he is a man of enormous \nability, and I haveten to know him very well as a result of \nwhat he did in Afghanistan, and he did a terrific job in Iraq. \nHe visited with the parties and he reaffirmed the judgment we \nhad come to that we could not really have the right kind of \nelection between now and say the end of June, and there were \ncertain deficiencies in the caucus process that we were looking \nat, and he recommended that we look at additional options for \nthe purpose of selecting an interim government for Iraq. We are \nstill driving toward a 30 June date. We think it is achievable. \nAmbassador Bremer is hard at work on the administrative law \nnow. 28 February was our deadline. It is getting close. I have \nnot talked to Jerry in the last 24 hours to see whether he \nthinks he will make it or not, but I think we are getting very \nclose. There are some issues having to do with Kurdish \nauthorities and the regional government of Kurdistan and some \nother issues that have to be dealt with. They are not easy, but \nI think we are getting close to conclusion of the work on the \nadministrative law.\n    The next real piece of work to be done--and we are looking \nforward to seeing what Ambassador Brahimi and the Secretary \nGeneral might have to say about this--is what kind of interim \ngovernment will you put in place? Will it be the governing \ncouncil, an expanded governing council? Will it be Asura coming \nup with another group of individuals to take sovereignty? A \nvariety of alternatives are being looked at, not only by us, of \ncourse, by the United Nations, but more importantly, by the \nIraqis themselves as to how they want to go about it. And that \nwill be the major activity of our governance group in the weeks \nahead, what kind of sovereign government should we be \nsupporting for hand over on the 30th of June?"
"corzine","Senator Corzine","corzine","Senator Corzine","    The deadline appears though, you still \nvery certain can be met in some format, just a different \nformat?\n    Secretary Powell. Yes, 30 June still is achievable and we \nare all working toward that 30 June turnover."
"corzine","Senator Corzine","corzine","Senator Corzine","    I am sure you have read the Brahimi or the \ninterim report or the fact-finding report.\n    Secretary Powell. Yes."
"corzine","Senator Corzine","corzine","Senator Corzine","    One of those things that sticks out very \nreally, very prominently in that report is that security \nconstraints are still a serious issue on the ground, and to \nsome extent did not seem to jive with I thought your opening \nstatement. There is some acknowledgement that security is \ngetting better. They were not allowed to travel outside \nBaghdad. I am just reading from the report. They were not \nactually allowed to travel seriously in Baghdad, according to \nthe report. How do you assess the security situation on the \nground?\n    Secretary Powell. The security situation on the ground is \nimproving but it is still dangerous. We are still losing \npeople. There are still old regime elements and terrorists in \nIraq who are doing everything they can to thwart our efforts. \nThe Iraqi security forces are being built up and are being \ntargeted because they are being built up. People understand, \nthe bad guys understand that they want to go after Iraqi \nsecurity forces, perhaps even more than they want to go after \ncoalition military forces because they are trying to keep this \nfrom happening. So we still have a difficult situation. Our \ncommanders I think know what they have to do, and we are \nputting a lot of effort and energy into building up the Iraqi \npolice force, the civil defense corps, the army, the border \npolice, and all the other security institutions that Iraq will \nneed when it becomes a sovereign nation. Over 200,000 people, \nclose to that number now, are now involved in Iraqi security \noperations, Iraqis involved in Iraqi security operations. So I \nthink things will improve, but it is dangerous.\n    Now, the team you are making reference to, they were not \nable to get as much access as they wanted, or they may have \nchosen not to go where they wanted because they were not \ncomfortable with the security arrangements. But they got their \nwork done, and we hope that by the time 1 July comes around, \nwhen we think there is an even more comprehensive role for the \nU.N. to play getting ready for elections, we will have put in \nplace security arrangements, working with the United Nations, \nthat will allow them to move more freely. But it is still a \ndangerous area."
"corzine","Senator Corzine","corzine","Senator Corzine","    One last followup question. You just \nimplied in your response that it is insurgency, I take it \nprimarily as the fomenter of the violence and lack of security, \nseem to have a debate going on among different elements of both \nour intelligence and/or defense establishment about whether \nwhat we are primarily seeing on the ground being outside \ninfluenced elements who are causing the security problems or \ninsurgents?\n    Secretary Powell. We are seeing both. I do not think there \nis a debate. I think we are seeing both. On any day of the week \nyou can get two opinions as to whether we are seeing more of \none and less of the other or what the trends are for each. I \nthink the Intelligence Community generally believes that we are \nseeing additional terrorists coming into the country and that \nthe former regime elements are coming more under control, but \nwe are seeing both. We are also seeing criminality, just plain \ncriminality, people who want to blow up pipelines, want to \nsteal from the pipelines, people who for one reason or another \nthat has nothing to do with being a former regime element or a \nterrorist who just came into the country, want to cause \ntrouble. So anyone who says it is all this or all that, that is \nnot a correct assessment in my judgment. It is still a \ncombination.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Corzine, thank you very much.\n    A quick question. You have mentioned 200,000 people are \nbeing trained. Is that 200,000 Iraqis?\n    Secretary Powell. 200,000 Iraqis are performing some kind \nof security function, whether in the police, in the civil \ndefense groups, border patrol, pipeline security, or the army \nitself.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Nelson."
"nelson","Senator Nelson","corzine","Senator Corzine","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Mr. Secretary, thank you again for being so resolute as we \ncontinue to look for Captain Scott Spiker. There is a team over \nthere that is looking for him, and although this is outside of \nyour bailiwick, with your credentials of your past life, if you \nwould just keep the pressure up, and I will give this to your \nstaff.

I have been over there. There is a major who \nwas set to rotate back. He is now a lieutenant colonel. He \nextended to keep up the search. From time to time we get some \npromising information, but we do not have any results yet. So I \nam going to give that to your staff.\n    Secretary Powell. I will stay on it, Senator. He was lost \non my watch."
"nelson","Senator Nelson","nelson","Senator Nelson","    Thank you. You know I want to talk to you \nabout Haiti. When you were with us in our Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee 2 weeks ago I asked you the question, is it \nthe policy of the Government for regime change? You said, No, \nit is the policy of the Government that it is not for regime \nchange. I want to suggest to you that what appears to be the \nhands-off policy of the U.S. Government with regard to Haiti is \nin effect going to bring about regime change. Now, we might \nagree at the end of the day that Aristide is a bad character \nwho has been corrupt and very ineffective, but in effect, when \nthe U.S. Government lays hands off and allows the violence and \nthe bloodshed to increase, that is going to bring about the \nregime change, and Aristide is going to go. And I know you have \nprobably been overruled by the White House on this to keep a \nhands-off policy. I would like any of your comment on that, and \nthen I want to encourage you, although you all have not taken \nmy recommendation of putting an international police force in \nthere with the other nations of the western hemisphere, that \nwhen he abdicates, it is clearly time for us to get in there \nand try to settle that thing down, because as you can see, just \nlook at the news, you can see the rickety boats that they are \nbuilding. They are turning up on Jamaica, they are turning up \non the Turks and Caicos. 20 of them turned up on a freighter 5 \nmiles off the Florida coast. This exodus is coming if we do not \nget in there and stabilize it.\n    Secretary Powell. Senator, I have not been overruled by the \nWhite House. There is no basis for it because the President and \nI have discussed this issue almost every day, and we have a \ncommon mind. We were together on it 7 o'clock last night in the \nOval Office, and he and I discussed it again on the phone at 7 \no'clock this morning.\n    We have been trying to find a political solution to this \ncrisis. I have been in daily contact with the CARICOM leaders, \nwith France, with Canada, with the United Nations. I have been \nin relatively constant contact over the last week with the \nauthorities in Haiti. I have been in contact with the \nopposition leaders of the DP. I have talked to them in groups. \nI have sent Ambassador Noriega down there to talk to them. We \nhave tried to find a political solution. It has not been a \nsuccessful effort at this point, and we continue to try to see \nif there is not a way forward.\n    The issue of sending in a security force, be it a police \nforce or a military force, has come up time and again. In fact, \nit came up again within the last 24 to 48 hours. What we have \nsaid and what my French colleague Dominique de Villepin said \nyesterday, and it has been somewhat misinterpreted was that the \ninternational community stands ready to help put together an \ninternational security force, whether it is police of some \ncomponent gendarmerie or military or whatever. The \ninternational community stands ready to put that force \ntogether, as my French colleague said yesterday, as part of \nstabilizing some political resolution to this problem.\n    What the international community--and there may be some \nmembers of the community who feel a little differently--but \nmost of the members of the international community with the \ncapacity to send forces in there have said is that Haiti really \nneeds to find a political resolution to this problem. We do not \nwant to get into an inter-positional situation between opposing \nforces at this time and coming down on one side or the other.\n    I spent a great deal of time yesterday on the phone with \nForeign Minister de Villepin, spoke to him again this morning, \nand he made his statement clear yesterday that France is \nwilling to participate in such an effort. So is the United \nStates. So is CARICOM. So is Canada. There may be African \nnations of the francophone community that are willing to \nparticipate in that, but we need to see some kind of political \nresolution.\n    We have not succeeded in getting the political opposition, \nthe DP as it is known, to agree to enter into this current \nproposal with President Aristide. The reasoning is well known. \nThey have stated it clearly. They believe they have been misled \nin previous discussions with him. At the same time, we are \nconcerned about the humanitarian situation. We are doing \neverything we can to make sure that food stocks are protected. \nThere are some distribution problems in Haiti, but for the most \npart there is adequate food, medicine and other necessary \nstocks.\n    I am very sensitive to the plight of the Haitian people, \nand we spent time this morning talking about a spurt in the \nnumber of people coming out onto our cutters, and there is a \nmeeting taking place in the interagency community right now I \nthink on how we should respond to that challenge.\n    President Aristide is aware of all that we have been trying \nto do. He understands that we have not been able to reach an \naccommodation with the DP. I know that he is taking a look at \nthe situation. I do not know what judgments he may come to. But \nwe are in a difficult moment in the life of Haiti, the life of \nHaitian people. It is a great disappointment to me to find \nourselves in this position.\n    I went down 10 years ago with Senator Nunn and with \nPresident Carter and talked the generals out in order for \nPresident Aristide to come back in, and I regret that over \nthose 10 years we have not seen the kind of progress that we \nhad hoped for. President Clinton invested a couple of years of \nmilitary presence. The international community spent tons of \nmoney trying to put in place a professional police force, and \nit did not work, and the political process, the democratic \npolitical process in Haiti has essentially collapsed, and the \ninternational community is ready to get engaged, willing to get \nengaged. There are debates and discussions taking place in the \nU.N. today, but anybody who looks at this says, what is it we \nare getting into? And we have gotten into something that looks \nlike it is a political solution, and that has not yet emerged."
"nelson","Senator Nelson","nelson","Senator Nelson","    Mr. Secretary, I pray that you are \nsuccessful, and then once the country is stabilized, then I \nthink we have to have fresh thinking about how we help them \nstay stabilized in the future. I say this in a bipartisan way \nbecause I think at the end of the immediate past administration \nthat they started to let Haiti slip out of their sights, as has \nthis administration up to this point. So I pray that you are \nsuccessful, and then let us get our heads together of how it is \ngoing to be stabilized for the long run, and the kind of \neconomic assistance that will give it some hope so that people \nwill not constantly want to flee.\n    Secretary Powell. As you know, Senator, we have provided \nover $800 million from 1995 to the present to Haiti. We are \nstill providing funding to Haiti, $75 million this past year. \nThere is a request in our budget for more. The international \nfinancial community and the institutions of the international \nfinancial community are willing to help more, but they have \nbecome frustrated that the money does not seem to produce the \nkind of results intended. And so there is a reluctance, until \nthe political situation stabilizes itself and there is a \nlegislature and there is a functioning executive branch with \nsome security in the country, and there are institutions that \nare functioning, there is a reluctance from the international \ncommunity to just pour money into the place. But we are doing \nour part with respect to meeting the immediate needs of the \nHaitian people through NGO and private organizations, and we \nwill continue to do so.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Nelson, thank you very much.\n    Mr. Secretary, you have 5 more minutes?\n    Secretary Powell. Yes, sir, certainly.\n    Chairman Nickles. Just a couple of other issues Senator \nConrad and I wanted to bring up. One is on the issue of foreign \nadoptions. Right now foreign adoptions are basically regulated \nby the Citizens and Immigration Services and the State \nDepartment. I have introduced legislation with Senator Landrieu \nand a bipartisan group of Senators called the Inter-Country \nAdoption Reform Act, basically put it under the Department of \nState, try and consolidate it, get it to where it will work \nmuch more efficiently.\n    Would you review that and give us your thoughts? It would \nbe put in under your shop. I think it would make it work a lot \nbetter, simplify the process. I would appreciate your getting \nback to us on your thoughts and comments.\n    Secretary Powell. I will look at it, Senator, right away.\n    Chairman Nickles. Also I want to just touch on a couple of \nother things. The big increases in your budget are for AIDS and \nfor the Millennium Account.\n    Secretary Powell. Right.\n    Chairman Nickles. Last November, December, I went with \nAmbassador Tobias and Secretary Thompson on an AIDS African \ntrip. Our work over there is meeting a need that is enormous, \nenormous, and I compliment you and the President. Ambassador \nTobias is just an outstanding representative, taking on a \nchallenge. I look at the job that you have, the job that we \nhave, we all have big jobs around here. That is an enormous \nchallenge as well, and I think we have the right person in \nthere.\n    The Global Fund assistance that Congress appropriated last \nyear was $546 million. The amount that is in your budget is \n$200 million. The administration requested a total of $2.8 \nbillion, and last year we appropriated a total of 2.4 billion. \nSo I have not looked at all the differences, but I do know that \nCongress put in a lot of money in the Global Fund that was not \nrequested, and you are requesting more money in other places. \nIs the 2.8 consistent on this, meeting that commitment of $15 \nbillion?\n    Secretary Powell. Yes, sir.\n    Chairman Nickles. I appreciate that. Also I want to just \ntouch on one other thing. The other big piece of that--and you \nmentioned they are combined, and I would echo that--the \nMillennium Challenge coupled with the Global AIDS Fund. One or \ntwo of the African countries I saw were so poor, and I am \nthinking there are such enormous resources here, if they had a \nlegal system, if they had private property ownership. Uganda is \none--and there are others--the most fertile country I have ever \nseen, and yet we are sending food aid. They could grow enough \nto feed not only Ugandans but many other countries, but in many \ncases they do not have the rule of law and they do not have \nprivate property, and so I compliment you on both.\n    Now, on the financial side of it, last year you talked me \ninto a billion dollars for a new program. This year you are \nasking that program to grow to $2-1/2 billion. You have not \nobligated as of yet the billion dollars. Do you really need \nthat $2-1/2 billion in 2005? Can we not slip some of that into \n2006 and 2007. The increase we have on all nondefense programs \nis $2 billion, and you are asking a billion and a half of it \nfor the Millennium Challenge Fund. You are not really quite \nready to spend $3-1/2 billion or even obligate $3-1/2 billion, \nare you?\n    Secretary Powell. I recommend you really not slip it into \nthe out years, Senator. We need that money in our accounts now \nin order to start planning how we are going to ramp up this \nprogram as fast as we can. There are countries that are \ndesperately in need.\n    Let me just touch on another effect that the program is \nhaving already. I am already hearing from a number of \ncountries--you were concerned that they are not going to meet \nall the standards required for eligibility. They are asking: \n``Can we send a delegation to see you right away?'' ``What do \nwe have to do?'' ``What do we have to do on the rule of law?'' \n``What more do we have to do on corruption?'' ``What is our \ngrade?'' ``What is the threshold for passing?'' They want to be \na part of this program. I think the way in which it is \nstructured right now, with one now and two plus next year shows \ndetermination, shows the commitment of the President, of the \nAmerican people and the Congress. So I would you not slip the \ntwo, and we will be ramping this up as far as we can.\n    Chairman Nickles. I appreciate it. With the concept I am \nwith you 100 percent and I compliment you.\n    One other compliment I want to make and that is in the \nOffice of International Religious Freedom. Senator Lieberman \nand I sponsored that bill years ago. We found then that there \nwas a lot of countries where people were persecuted and in some \ncases killed because of their religious beliefs. We find it \nwith friends and allies even, in countries like Pakistan, Saudi \nArabia or countries like China and others. The purpose of that \nbill was to highlight some of the problems and give us a lot of \ntools to help fix those problems, and I would just say I just \nhave been looking at the report that was released just last \nDecember by the Commission, and it was an outstanding report. I \nwould urge more attention I guess from all of us, Members of \nCongress and others. I find when we raise some of these issues \nwith some of our countries, that our allies, our friends in the \nwar on terrorism and so on, that they want to be cooperative. \nSo I compliment the Ambassador-at-Large, Mr. Hanford, but also \nthe work that that Commission is doing.\n    I am amazed at how significant religious persecution is \ntoday in lots of places in the world. In Pakistan somebody \nwalked into a church and just machine gunned people, and that \nhappened recently, and so I think this Commission helped \nhighlight some of the problems and also has good suggestions \nfor some of the solutions.\n    Secretary Powell. Thank you, Senator. I fully support \nAmbassador Hanford and his work. It is a good report. \nYesterday, I issued the Human Rights Report, and then we also \nhave the Trafficking in Persons Report. All of these go to the \nhuman condition and what we believe God intended for all of \nmankind to enjoy, and we will continue to press these reports \nthat frankly are the products of Congress. You wanted us to do \nthis, and we take them all very, very seriously, and we go \nafter these issues aggressively.\n    Chairman Nickles. Thank you very much. I think maybe in \nmany cases we in Congress have not done enough to followup on \nthem, but we can do that with our individual contacts with some \nof the embassies and on some of our trips, and hope that the \nState Department people would as well.\n    Senator Conrad."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","nelson","Senator Nelson","    Thank you again, Mr. Chairman.\n    Mr. Secretary, one of our colleagues suggested that somehow \nI had misled on the Greenspan testimony yesterday. I did not. I \nwas quoting directly from the Washington Post Dispatch on what \noccurred there, and I just put it up. That is what I quoted \nfrom. ``Fed Chief urges Cut in Social Security.'' That is the \nheadline. ``Future benefits must be curtailed, Greenspan \nwarns.'' And I would be happy to go through the story, set the \nrecord straight here on what was said and what I alluded to. \n``Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned Congress \nyesterday the Federal Government has promised more retirement \nbenefits than it can pay for and must consider scaling back \nthose commitments soon to avoid damaging the economy in the \nfuture.''\n    ``I am just basically saying we are over committed at this \nstage,'' Greenspan told members of the House Budget Committee. \nGreenspan, who supported President Bush's 2001 tax cuts again \nendorsed Bush proposal to make the tax cuts permanent. However, \nhe said in response to questions that raising taxes would \ninevitably be part of any successful effort to reduce the \ngrowing Federal budget deficit. he stressed her prefers cutting \nspending as much as possible before increasing taxes. He said, \n``You don't have the resources to do it all.'' To curtail \nfuture spending Greenspan urges Congress, as he has in the \npast, to consider cutting promised Social Security benefits to \nfuture retirees. ``Otherwise,'' he said, ``the growing burdens \nwould create long term budget deficits that would drive up \ninterest rates, depress economic growth, make it even harder \nfor the Government to pay its bills.''"
break,break,break,break
"","","conrad","Senator Conrad","    That is what he said. That is about as clear as it can be. \nIt is very interesting if one looks at what the President is \nproposing. He is proposing in his budget to borrow $2.4 \ntrillion from Social Security that is funded by payroll taxes, \nand have tax cuts of $2.4 trillion over that same period that \nare largely going to income tax payers. That is the greatest \nshift of benefits from the many to the few in the history of \nthis country. When one talks about class warfare, that is class \nwarfare writ large.\n    Let me just ask you this.\n    Chairman Nickles. Senator Conrad, you and I will need to \ndebate that another day. The Secretary is being very generous \nwith his time."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    I just want to ask you this on the \nsupplemental. Will you be asking for a supplemental as you have \nthe least 3 years?\n    Secretary Powell. In 2005?"
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Yes.\n    Secretary Powell. I would expect that there would be a \nsupplemental in 2005, sir."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    Can you give us any sense of how big it \nmight be? Last year's reconstruction supplemental was $21 \nbillion. Can you give us any sense----\n    Secretary Powell. No, I cannot, sir. Really, I do not have \nany way of putting a number to it. If we could put a number to \nit clearly, then it would more likely be in the 2005 budget. It \nis up to the President ultimately to decide whether there will \nbe a supplemental, what the amount is. But I think our planning \nassumption is that there will be a need for a 2005 \nsupplemental.\n    Senator Bunning is not here, but since you mention it--I \ncould not quite read the article, but I did hear you say the \nword ``consider'' reductions. I think the point the Senator was \nmaking earlier was that Mr. Greenspan had said ``consider,'' \nwhereas the headline suggests that he was advocating cuts."
"conrad","Senator Conrad","conrad","Senator Conrad","    I do not think there is any question he is \nadvocating cuts. He is saying to us to consider. It is his \nrecommendation. I think that is very clear, and that is not \nonly clear based on what he said yesterday, it is clear on what \nhe said 2 weeks ago. It got almost no press attention. So I \nthink it is very clear, he is saying to us we are over \ncommitted, none of this adds up, and it does not add up, and \nthat is the problem we have.\n    When you send up a budget and you tell us here you are \ngoing to ask for a supplemental but you do not provide a \nnumber, the thing we know is the right answer is not zero. But \nwhat you have in this budget, or more accurately, the President \nhas, is zero. We know that is not what it is going to be.\n    Chairman Nickles. Mr. Secretary, I want to thank you. I \nmight mention that last year when we did the very large, $20 \nbillion supplemental, actually I think it is $21 billion, we \nwere told that that would basically be it, and not to expect a \n2005 supplemental. That is still my expectation. I could be \ncorrected, but I would like to be corrected if that is the \ncase. We were told that other countries were going to be \nparticipating more. That was a large, large, large amount of \nmoney, and I look at the amount of money that is compared to \nwhat we have done in the past, and we were basically assured \nlast year, when Ambassador Bremer and the administration \nrequested that $21 billion and a lot of us were swallowing \nhard, that we would not be seeing another supplemental for \ninfrastructure for Iraq.\n    Secretary Powell. I think we made it clear that there would \nnot be another 2004 supplemental, and I do not know what \nAmbassador Bremer believes the needs in 2005 will be. But I \ncannot tell you today that neither the Defense Department, \nState Department, or other agencies of Government will not have \nneed for a 2005 supplemental. It will be up to the President to \ndecide whether or not a supplemental is forthcoming. It cannot \nbe decided now what an amount might be in such a supplemental.\n    Chairman Nickles. Mr. Secretary, thank you. My staff \ninforms me that the commitment was that we would not see \nanother supplemental in 2004.\n    Secretary Powell. Right, Senator."
