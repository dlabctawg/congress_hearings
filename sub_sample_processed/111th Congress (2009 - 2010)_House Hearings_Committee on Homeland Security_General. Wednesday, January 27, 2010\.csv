"richardson","Honorable Laura Richardson","","","                            January 27, 2010\n    Mr. Chairman, thank you for convening this very important hearing \ntoday focusing on the circumstances surrounding the attempted terrorist \nbombing of Northwest Flight 253 on December 25, 2009. It is important \nfor the House to get answers regarding the events of that day. I thank \nour distinguished panel of witnesses for appearing before us today to \nshare with us the lessons learned from this averted tragedy.\n    Like millions of Americans, I am a frequent air traveler, which \nmakes the events of December 25 particularly personal to us all. While \nair travel still ranks as one of the safest ways to travel, this is an \nindustry where a single incident can become an enormous tragedy. Beyond \nthe lives lost and the damage to our economy, both the air travel \nindustry and the Nation suffers as the public loses confidence in the \nintegrity of our homeland security system.\n    It is disturbing to think what could have happened without the \nbrave actions of the passengers aboard Flight 253. Those passengers are \nheroes and we cannot thank them enough for what they did. But what the \ncommittee is focusing on today is what should have happened, what \nsystems should have worked, before we reached that point.\n    There are several questions to be explored today: (1) Why our \nintelligence agencies did not connect the dots regarding the suspect, \n(2) the efficiency of our visa and watch lists systems, (3) the \nexpanding nature of al-Quaeda, and (4) what technology we use, or \nshould be using, that would have prevented the events of December 25.\n    Also, I think we need to address why all the Members of this \ncommittee were not notified and briefed in a timely fashion.\n    In the days and hours immediately after Christmas day, Members of \nthis committee were not briefed by the administration or TSA. As \nMembers of the committee tasked with jurisdiction over the agencies \nresponsible for security, that cannot be allowed to happen again. I \nlook forward to working with the Chairman, my colleagues, and the \nadministration to ensure that timely and meaningful consultation and \ninformation sharing takes place.\n    I look forward to the testimony of our distinguished panel of \nwitnesses. We need to know exactly what went wrong and what we can do \nto prevent these repeated mistakes from happening again.\n    Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for convening this hearing. I yield \nback the balance of my time."

"","","richardson","Honorable Laura Richardson","    Chairman Thompson. Before I welcome our witnesses, I want \nto indicate that Secretary Napolitano was invited to this \nhearing. We were told that she would be out of the country. I \nnow understand she is no longer out of the country, but she is \nnot here, so maybe Deputy Secretary Lute, you can pull us in on \nwhere the Secretary is.\n    Our first witness is Dr. Jane Holl Lute, the Deputy \nSecretary for the Department of Homeland Security. Dr. Lute has \nbeen before the committee a number of times and has been very \nstraightforward in her presentations, and we appreciate that.\n    Our second witness is Mr. Patrick Kennedy, Under Secretary \nof Management at the Department of State. Our final witness is \nMr. Michael Leiter, Director of the National Counterterrorism \nCenter.\n    Without objection, the witnesses' full statement and a \nstatement provided by GAO and a statement by the ACLU will be \ninserted into the record. I now ask each witness to summarize \ntheir statement for 5 minutes, beginning with Deputy Secretary \nLute.\nStatement of Eileen R. Larence, Director, Homeland Security and Justice \n Issues, and Stephen M. Lord, Director, Homeland Security and Justice \n                Issues, Government Accountability Office\n                            January 27, 2010\n                             gao highlights\n    Highlights of GAO-10-401T, a statement for the record to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives.\nWhy GAO Did This Study\n    The December 25, 2009, attempted bombing of Flight 253 raised \nquestions about the Federal Government's ability to protect the \nhomeland and secure the commercial aviation system. This statement \nfocuses on the Government's efforts to use the terrorist watch list to \nscreen individuals and determine if they pose a threat, and how \nfailures in this process contributed to the December 25 attempted \nattack. This statement also addresses the Transportation Security \nAdministration's (TSA) planned deployment of technologies for enhanced \nexplosive detection and the challenges associated with this deployment. \nGAO's comments are based on products issued from September 2006 through \nOctober 2009 and selected updates in January 2010. For these updates, \nGAO reviewed Government reports related to the December 25 attempted \nattack and obtained information from the Department of Homeland \nSecurity (DHS) and TSA on use of the watch list and new technologies \nfor screening airline passengers.\nWhat GAO Recommends\n    GAO is not making new recommendations, but has made recommendations \nin prior reports to DHS, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and \nthe White House Homeland Security Council to enhance the use of the \nwatch list and to TSA related to checkpoint technologies. The agencies \ngenerally agreed and are making some progress, but full implementation \nis needed.\nhomeland security.--better use of terrorist watch list information and \n improvements in deployment of passenger checkpoint technologies could \n                      further strengthen security\nWhat GAO Found\n    The intelligence community uses standards of reasonableness to \nevaluate individuals for nomination to the consolidated terrorist watch \nlist. In making these determinations, agencies are to consider \ninformation from all available sources. However, for the December 25 \nsubject, the intelligence community did not effectively complete these \nsteps and link available information to the subject before the \nincident. Therefore, agencies did not nominate the individual to the \nwatch list or any of the subset lists that are used during agency \nscreening processes, such as the ``No-Fly'' list. Weighing and \nresponding to the potential impacts that changes to the nomination \ncriteria would have on the traveling public will be an important \nconsideration in determining what changes may be needed. Also, \nscreening agencies stated that they do not check against all records in \nthe watch list, partly because screening against certain records may \nnot be needed to support a respective agency's mission or may not be \npossible because of the requirements of computer programs used to check \nindividuals against watch list records. In October 2007, GAO reported \nthat not checking against all records may pose a security risk and \nrecommended that DHS and the FBI assess potential vulnerabilities, but \nthey have not completed these assessments. TSA is implementing an \nadvanced airline passenger prescreening program--known as Secure \nFlight--that could potentially result in the Federal Government \nchecking passengers against the entire watch list under certain \nsecurity conditions. Further, the Government lacks an up-to-date \nstrategy and implementation plan--supported by a clearly defined \nleadership or governance structure--which are needed to enhance the \neffectiveness of terrorist-related screening and ensure accountability \nfor the process. In the 2007 report, GAO recommended that the Homeland \nSecurity Council ensure that a governance structure exists that has the \nrequisite authority over the watch list process. The council did not \ncomment on this recommendation.\n    As GAO reported in October 2009, since TSA's creation, 10 passenger \nscreening technologies have been in various phases of research, \ndevelopment, procurement, and deployment, including the Advanced \nImaging Technology (AIT)--formerly known as the Whole Body Imager. TSA \nexpects to have installed almost 200 AITs in airports by the end of \ncalendar year 2010 and plans to install a total of 878 units by the end \nof fiscal year 2014. In October 2009, GAO reported that TSA had not yet \nconducted an assessment of the technology's vulnerabilities to \ndetermine the extent to which a terrorist could employ tactics that \nwould evade detection by the AIT. Thus, it is unclear whether the AIT \nor other technologies would have detected the weapon used in the \nDecember 25 attempted attack. GAO's report also noted the problems TSA \nexperienced in deploying another checkpoint technology that had not \nbeen tested in the operational environment. Since GAO's October report, \nTSA stated that it has completed the testing as of the end of 2009. We \nare currently verifying that all functional requirements of the AIT \nwere tested in an operational environment. Completing these steps \nshould better position TSA to ensure that moving ahead with a costly \ndeployment of AIT machines will enhance passenger checkpoint security.\n    Mr. Chairman and Members of the committee: We are pleased to submit \nthis statement on the progress Federal agencies have made and the \nchallenges they face in key areas of terrorism information sharing and \nthe deployment of checkpoint technologies. The December 25, 2009, \nattempted bombing of Flight 253 has led to increased scrutiny of how \nthe Government creates and uses the consolidated terrorist screening \ndatabase (the watch list) to screen individuals and determine if they \npose a security threat, and highlighted the importance of detecting \nimprovised explosive devices and other prohibited items on passengers \nbefore they board a commercial aircraft. The White House's initial \nreview of these events exposed gaps in how intelligence agencies \ncollected, shared, and analyzed terrorism-related information to \ndetermine if the subject--Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab--posed enough of a \nthreat to warrant placing him on the watch list, which could have \naltered the course of events that day. To enhance its ability to detect \nexplosive devices and other prohibited items on passengers, the \nTransportation Security Administration (TSA) is evaluating the use of \nAdvanced Imaging Technology (AIT)--formerly called the Whole Body \nImager--as an improvement over current screening capabilities.\n    In October 2007, we released a report on the results of our \nreview--conducted at your request--of how the watch list is created and \nmaintained, and how Federal, State, and local security partners use the \nlist to screen individuals for potential threats to the homeland.\\1\\ As \na result of that review, we identified potential vulnerabilities, \nincluding ones created because agencies were not screening against all \nrecords in the watch list. We made a number of recommendations aimed at \naddressing these potential vulnerabilities and helping to enhance the \neffectiveness of the watch list process, which the agencies have not \nyet fully addressed. These recommendations--which we discuss later in \nthis statement--are still important to address and can inform on-going \nreviews of the December 25 attempted terrorist attack.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\1\\ GAO, Terrorist Watchlist Screening: Opportunities Exist to \nEnhance Management Oversight, Reduce Vulnerabilities in Agency \nScreening Processes, and Expand Use of the List, GAO-08-110 \n(Washington, DC: Oct. 11, 2007).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Also, in January 2005, we designated information sharing for \nhomeland security a high-risk area because the Government faced \nformidable challenges in analyzing and disseminating this information \nin a timely, accurate, and useful manner.\\2\\ Since then, we have been \nmonitoring and making recommendations to improve the Government's \nefforts to share terrorism-related information, not only among Federal \nagencies but also with their State, local, Tribal, and private sector \nsecurity partners.\\3\\ Addressing this high-risk area is important to \nhelp remove barriers that lead to agencies maintaining information in \nstove-piped systems, and to hold them accountable to the Congress and \nthe public for ensuring terrorism information is shared, is used, and \nmakes a difference. We are continuing to review Federal agencies' \nefforts to share terrorism-related information and expect to report the \nresults of this work later this year.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\2\\ See GAO, High-Risk Series: An Update, GAO-09-271 (Washington, \nDC: January 2009), for our most recent update.\n    \\3\\ See, for example, GAO, Information Sharing: The Federal \nGovernment Needs to Establish Policies and Processes for Sharing \nTerrorism-Related and Sensitive but Unclassified Information, GAO-06-\n385 (Washington, DC: Mar. 17, 2006); Information Sharing Environment: \nDefinition of the Results to Be Achieved in Improving Terrorism-Related \nInformation Sharing Is Needed to Guide Implementation and Assess \nProgress, GAO-08-492 (Washington, DC: June 25, 2008); and Information \nSharing: Federal Agencies Are Sharing Border and Terrorism Information \nwith Local and Tribal Law Enforcement Agencies, but Additional Efforts \nAre Needed, GAO-10-41 (Washington, DC: Dec. 18, 2009).\n    \\4\\ We have three on-going reviews of terrorism-related information \nsharing that are being conducted based on separate requests from your \ncommittee, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and \nthe Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    In addition, in October 2009, we released a report on TSA's efforts \nto deploy checkpoint technologies and the challenges the agency faces \nin these efforts.\\5\\ We made eight recommendations related to the \nresearch, development, and deployment of these technologies. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) agreed with our recommendations \nand identified actions planned or under way to implement them. While \nDHS is taking steps to address our recommendations related to \nconducting risk assessments, the actions DHS reported that TSA had \ntaken or plans to take do not fully address the intent of the majority \nof our recommendations.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\5\\ GAO, Aviation Security: DHS and TSA Have Researched, Developed, \nand Begun Deploying Passenger Checkpoint Screening Technologies, but \nContinue to Face Challenges, GAO-10-128 (Washington, DC: Oct. 7, 2009).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    This statement for the record discusses: (1) The Government's \nefforts to use the terrorist watch list to screen individuals and \ndetermine if they pose a threat, as well as how aspects of this process \ncontributed to the December 25 attempted terrorist attack and (2) TSA's \nplanned deployment of the AIT for enhanced explosive detection and the \nchallenges associated with this deployment.\n    This statement is based on products GAO issued from September 2006 \nthrough October 2009.\\6\\ In conducting our prior work, we reviewed \ndocumentation obtained from and interviewed officials at the various \ndepartments and agencies with responsibilities for compiling and using \nwatch list records. We also reviewed documentation and obtained \ninformation on current checkpoint screening technologies being \nresearched, developed, and deployed. Our previously published reports \ncontain additional details on the scope and methodology for those \nreviews. In addition, this statement contains selected updates \nconducted in December 2009 and January 2010. For the updates, GAO \nreviewed Government reports and other information related to the \nDecember 25 attempted attack, obtained information from DHS and TSA on \nthe use of watch list records and new technologies for screening \nairline passengers, and interviewed a senior TSA official. We conducted \nour updated work in December 2009 and January 2010 in accordance with \ngenerally accepted Government auditing standards.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\6\\ See GAO, Terrorist Watch List Screening: Efforts to Help Reduce \nAdverse Effects on the Public, GAO-06-1031 (Washington, DC: Sept. 29, \n2006); GAO-08-110; Aviation Security: TSA Has Completed Key Activities \nAssociated with Implementing Secure Flight, but Additional Actions Are \nNeeded to Mitigate Risks, GAO-09-292 (Washington, DC: May 13, 2009); \nand GAO-10-128.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               in summary\n    Because the subject of the December 25 attempted terrorist attack \nwas not nominated for inclusion on the Government's consolidated \nterrorist screening database, Federal agencies responsible for \nscreening activities missed several opportunities to identify him and \npossibly take action. We have previously reported on a number of issues \nrelated to the compilation and use of watch list records, such as the \npotential security risk posed by not checking against all records on \nthe watch list. We also identified the need for an up-to-date strategy \nand implementation plan--one that describes the scope, governance, \noutcomes, milestones, and metrics, among other things--for managing the \nwatch list process across the Federal Government. Such a strategy and \nplan, supported by a clearly defined leadership or governance \nstructure, can be helpful in removing cultural, technological, and \nother barriers--such as those problems that the December 25 attempted \nterrorist attack exposed--that inhibit the effective use of watch list \ninformation.\n    With regard to the deployment of technology to detect explosives on \npassengers, TSA expects to have installed almost 200 AITs in airports \nby the end of calendar year 2010, and plans to procure and install a \ntotal of 878 units by the end of fiscal year 2014. While recently \nproviding GAO with updated information to our October 2009 report, TSA \nstated that operational testing for the AIT was completed as of the end \nof calendar year 2009. We are in the process of verifying that TSA \ntested all of the AIT functional requirements in an operational \nenvironment. Moreover, we previously reported that TSA had not yet \nconducted an assessment of the technology's vulnerabilities to \ndetermine the extent to which a terrorist could employ tactics that \nwould evade detection by the AIT. While we recognize that the AIT could \nprovide an enhanced detection capability, completing these steps should \nbetter position TSA to have the information necessary to ensure that \nmoving ahead with a costly deployment of AIT machines will enhance \npassenger checkpoint security.\n                               background\nTerrorist Watch List Process\n    The Terrorist Screening Center (TSC)--administered by the Federal \nBureau of Investigation (FBI)--is responsible for maintaining the U.S. \nGovernment's consolidated watch list and providing it to Federal \nagencies as well as State, local, and selected foreign partners for \ntheir use in screening individuals. TSC receives the vast majority of \nits watch list nominations and information from the National \nCounterterrorism Center (NCTC), which compiles information on known or \nsuspected international terrorists from Executive branch departments \nand agencies.\\7\\ In addition, the FBI provides TSC with information on \nknown or suspected domestic terrorists who operate primarily within the \nUnited States. To support agency screening processes, TSC first \ndetermines if each nomination contains specific minimum derogatory \ninformation for inclusion in its terrorist screening database. TSC then \nsends applicable records from the terrorist watch list to screening \nagency systems for use in efforts to deter or detect the movements of \nknown or suspected terrorists. For instance, applicable TSC records are \nprovided to TSA for use in prescreening airline passengers; to a U.S. \nCustoms and Border Protection (CBP) system for use in screening \ntravelers entering the United States; to a Department of State system \nfor use in screening visa applicants; and to an FBI system for use by \nState and local law enforcement agencies pursuant to arrests, \ndetentions, and other criminal justice purposes.\\8\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\7\\ By law, NCTC, which is within the Office of the Director of \nNational Intelligence, serves as the primary organization in the U.S. \nGovernment for analyzing and integrating all intelligence pertaining to \nterrorism and counterterrorism, except for intelligence pertaining \nexclusively to domestic terrorists and domestic counterterrorism. See \n50 U.S.C. \u0006404o(d)(1).\n    \\8\\ See GAO-08-110 for additional details on the compilation and \nuse of terrorist watch list records.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAirline Passenger Screening Using Checkpoint Screening Technology\n    Passenger screening is a process by which screeners inspect \nindividuals and their property to deter and prevent an act of violence \nor air piracy, such as the carrying of any unauthorized explosive, \nincendiary, weapon, or other prohibited item on board an aircraft or \ninto a sterile area.\\9\\ Screeners inspect individuals for prohibited \nitems at designated screening locations. TSA developed standard \noperating procedures for screening passengers at airport checkpoints. \nPrimary screening is conducted on all airline passengers before they \nenter the sterile area of an airport and involves passengers walking \nthrough a metal detector and carry-on items being subjected to X-ray \nscreening. Passengers who alarm the walkthrough metal detector or are \ndesignated as selectees--that is, passengers selected for additional \nscreening--must then undergo secondary screening, as well as passengers \nwhose carry-on items have been identified by the X-ray machine as \npotentially containing prohibited items.\\10\\ Secondary screening \ninvolves additional means for screening passengers, such as by hand-\nwand; physical pat-down; or, at certain airport locations, an \nexplosives trace portal (ETP), which is used to detect traces of \nexplosives on passengers by using puffs of air to dislodge particles \nfrom their bodies and clothing into an analyzer. Selectees' carry-on \nitems are also physically searched or screened for explosives, such as \nby using explosives trace detection machines.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\9\\ Sterile areas are generally located within the terminal where \npassengers are provided access to boarding aircraft, and access is \ncontrolled in accordance with TSA requirements.\n    \\10\\ A nonselectee passenger who alarms the walk-through metal \ndetector on the first pass is offered a second pass. If the passenger \ndeclines the second pass, the passenger must proceed to additional \nscreening. If the nonselectee passenger accepts the second pass and the \nmachine does not alarm, the passenger may generally proceed without \nfurther screening.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n assessing potential vulnerabilities related to not screening against \n all watch list records and ensuring clear lines of authority over the \n      watch list process would provide for its more effective use\nAgencies Rely Upon Standards of Reasonableness in Assessing Individuals \n        for Nomination to TSC's Watch List, but Did Not Connect \n        Available Information on Mr. Abdulmutallab to Determine Whether \n        a Reasonable Suspicion Existed\n    Federal agencies--particularly NCTC and the FBI--submit to TSC \nnominations of individuals to be included on the consolidated watch \nlist. For example, NCTC receives terrorist-related information from \nExecutive branch departments and agencies, such as the Department of \nState, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the FBI, and catalogs this \ninformation in its Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment database, \ncommonly known as the TIDE database. This database serves as the U.S. \nGovernment's central classified database with information on known or \nsuspected international terrorists. According to NCTC, agencies submit \nwatch list nomination reports to the center, but are not required to \nspecify individual screening systems that they believe should receive \nthe watch list record, such as the No-Fly list of individuals who are \nto be denied boarding an aircraft.\\11\\ NCTC is to presume that agency \nnominations are valid unless it has other information in its possession \nto rebut that position.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\11\\ As discussed later in this statement, agencies generally do \nnot use the full terrorist watch list to screen individuals. Rather, \nthey generally use subsets of the full list based on each agency's \nmission and other factors.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    To decide if a person poses enough of a threat to be placed on the \nwatch list, agencies are to follow Homeland Security Presidential \nDirective (HSPD) 6, which states that the watch list is to contain \ninformation about individuals ``known or appropriately suspected to be \nor have been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in \naid of, or related to terrorism.''\\12\\ HSPD-24 definitively established \nthe ``reasonable suspicion'' standard for watchlisting by providing \nthat agencies are to make available to other agencies all biometric \ninformation associated with ``persons for whom there is an articulable \nand reasonable basis for suspicion that they pose a threat to national \nsecurity.''\\13\\ NCTC is to consider information from all available \nsources and databases to determine if there is a reasonable suspicion \nof links to terrorism that warrants a nomination, which can involve \nsome level of subjectivity. The guidance on determining reasonable \nsuspicion, which TSC most recently updated in February 2009, contains \nspecific examples of the types of terrorism-related conduct that may \nmake an individual appropriate for inclusion on the watch list.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\12\\ The White House, Homeland Security Presidential Directive/\nHSPD-6, Subject: Integration and Use of Screening Information \n(Washington, DC, Sept. 16, 2003).\n    \\13\\ The White House, Homeland Security Presidential Directive/\nHSPD-24, Subject: Biometrics for Identification and Screening to \nEnhance National Security (Washington, DC, June 5, 2008).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    The White House's review of the December 25 attempted terrorist \nattack noted that Mr. Abdulmutallab's father met with U.S. Embassy \nofficers in Abuja, Nigeria, to discuss his concerns that his son may \nhave come under the influence of unidentified extremists and had \nplanned to travel to Yemen.\\14\\ However, according to NCTC, the \ninformation in the State Department's nomination report did not meet \nthe criteria for watchlisting in TSC's consolidated terrorist screening \ndatabase per the Government's established and approved nomination \nstandards. NCTC also noted that the State Department cable nominating \nMr. Abdulmutallab had no indication that the father was the source of \nthe information. According to the White House review of the December 25 \nattempted attack, the U.S. Government had sufficient information to \nhave uncovered and potentially disrupted the attack--including by \nplacing Mr. Abdulmutallab on the No-Fly list--but analysts within the \nintelligence community failed to connect the dots that could have \nidentified and warned of the specific threat.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\14\\ The White House, Summary of the White House Review of the \nDecember 25, 2009, Attempted Terrorist Attack (Washington, DC, Jan. 7, \n2010).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    After receiving the results of the White House's review of the \nDecember 25 attempted attack, the President called for members of the \nintelligence community to undertake a number of corrective actions--\nsuch as clarifying intelligence agency roles, responsibilities, and \naccountabilities to document, share, and analyze all sources of \nintelligence and threat threads related to terrorism, and accelerating \ninformation technology enhancements that will help with information \ncorrelation and analysis. The House Committee on Oversight and \nGovernment Reform has asked us, among other things, to assess \nGovernment efforts to revise the watch list process, including actions \ntaken related to the December 25 attempted attack.\n    As part of our monitoring of high-risk issues, we also have on-\ngoing work--at the request of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs--that is assessing agency efforts to create \nthe Information Sharing Environment, which is intended to break down \nbarriers to sharing terrorism-related information, especially across \nFederal agencies.\\15\\ Our work is designed to help ensure that Federal \nagencies have a road map that defines roles, responsibilities, actions, \nand time frames for removing barriers, as well as a system to hold \nagencies accountable to the Congress and the public for making progress \non these efforts. Among other things, this road map can be helpful in \nremoving cultural, technological, and other barriers that lead to \nagencies maintaining information in stove-piped systems so that it is \nnot easily accessible, similar to those problems that the December 25 \nattempted attack exposed. We expect to issue the results of this work \nlater this year.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\15\\ The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, \nas amended, defines the Information Sharing Environment as ``an \napproach that facilitates the sharing of terrorism and homeland \nsecurity information, which may include any method determined necessary \n458, \u0006 1016(a)(2), 118 Stat. 3638, 3665 (codified as amended at 6 \nU.S.C. \u0006 485(a)(3)). See also Homeland Security Act of 2002, 6 U.S.C. \u0006 \n482 (requiring the establishment of procedures for the sharing of \nhomeland security information, as defined by this section).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Not Placing Mr. Abdulmutallab on the Consolidated Watch List or Its \n        Subsets, the Government Missed Opportunities to Use These \n        Counterterrorism Tools\n    Following the December 25 attempted terrorist attack, questions \nwere raised as to what could have happened if Mr. Abdulmutallab had \nbeen on TSC's consolidated terrorist screening database. We created \nseveral scenarios to help explain how the watch list process is \nintended to work and what opportunities agencies could have had to \nidentify him if he was on the watch list. For example, according to \nTSC, if a record from the terrorist screening database is sent to the \nState Department's system and the individual in that record holds a \nvalid visa, TSC would compare the identifying information in the watch \nlist record against identifying information in the visa and forward \npositive matches to the State Department for possible visa revocation. \nIf an individual's visa is revoked, under existing procedures, this \ninformation is to be entered into the database CBP uses to screen \nairline passengers prior to their boarding, which we describe below. \nAccording to CBP, when the individual checks in for a flight, the on-\nsite CBP Immigration Advisory Program officers already would have been \napprised of the visa revocation by CBP and they would have checked the \nperson's travel documents to verify that the individual was a match to \nthe visa revocation record. Once the positive match was established, \nthe officers would have recommended that he not be allowed to board the \nflight.\n    Under another scenario, if an individual is on TSC's terrorist \nscreening database, existing processes provide CBP with the opportunity \nto identify the subject of a watch list record as part of the checks \nCBP is to conduct to see if airline passengers are eligible to be \nadmitted into the country. Specifically, for international flights \ndeparting to or from the United States (but not for domestic flights), \nCBP is to receive information on passengers obtained, for example, when \ntheir travel document is swiped. CBP is to check this passenger \ninformation against a number of databases to see if there are any \npersons who have immigration violations, criminal histories, or any \nother reason for being denied entry to the country, in accordance with \nthe agency's mission. According to CBP, when it identifies a U.S.-bound \npassenger who is on the watch list, it coordinates with other Federal \nagencies to evaluate the totality of available information to see what \naction is appropriate. In foreign airports where there is a CBP \nImmigration Advisory Program presence, the information on a watchlisted \nsubject is forwarded by CBP to program officers on-site. The officers \nwould then intercept the subject prior to boarding the aircraft and \nconfirm that the individual is watchlisted, and when appropriate based \non the derogatory information, request that the passenger be denied \nboarding.\n    In a third scenario, if an individual is on the watch list and is \nalso placed on the No-Fly or Selectee list, when the person checks in \nfor a flight, the individual's identifying information is to be checked \nagainst these lists. Individuals matched to the No-Fly list are to be \ndenied boarding. If the individual is matched to the Selectee list, the \nperson is to be subject to further screening, which could include \nphysical screening, such as a pat-down. The criteria in general that \nare used to place someone on either of these two lists include the \nfollowing:\n  <bullet> Persons who are deemed to be a threat to civil aviation or \n        National security and should be precluded from boarding an \n        aircraft are put on the No-Fly list.\n  <bullet> Persons who are deemed to be a threat to civil aviation or \n        National security but do not meet the criteria of the No-Fly \n        list are placed on the Selectee list and are to receive \n        additional security screening prior to being permitted to board \n        an aircraft.\\16\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\16\\ Of all of the screening databases that accept watch list \nrecords, only the No-Fly and Selectee lists require certain nomination \ncriteria or inclusion standards that are narrower than the ``known or \nappropriately suspected'' standard of HSPD-6. The most recent guidance \nrelated to the No-Fly and Selectee list criteria was issued in February \n2009.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    The White House Homeland Security Council devised these more \nstringent sets of criteria for the No-Fly and Selectee lists in part \nbecause these lists are not intended as investigative or information-\ngathering tools or tracking mechanisms, and TSA is a screening but not \nan intelligence agency.\\17\\ Rather, the lists are intended to help \nensure the safe transport of passengers and facilitate the flow of \ncommerce. However, the White House's review of the December 25 \nattempted terrorist attack raised questions about the effectiveness of \nthe criteria, and the President tasked the FBI and TSC with developing \nrecommendations for any needed changes to the nominations guidance and \ncriteria.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\17\\ The Homeland Security Council originally was established in \n2001 by Executive Order and subsequently codified into law by the \nHomeland Security Act of 2002 for the purpose of more effectively \ncoordinating the policies and functions of the Federal Government \nrelating to homeland security. See Exec. Order No. 13,228; Pub. L. No. \n107-296, tit. IX, 116 Stat. 2135, 2258-59 (codified at 6 U.S.C. \u0006\u0006 491-\n496). On May 26, 2009, the President announced the full integration of \nWhite House staff supporting National security and homeland security \ninto a new ``National Security Staff'' supporting all White House \npolicy-making activities relating to international, transnational, and \nhomeland security matters. The Homeland Security Council was maintained \nas the principle venue for interagency deliberations on issues that \naffect the security of the homeland, such as terrorism, weapons of mass \ndestruction, natural disasters, and pandemic influenza.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Weighing and responding to the potential impacts that changes to \nthe nominations guidance and criteria could have on the traveling \npublic and the airlines will be important considerations in developing \nsuch recommendations. In September 2006, we reported that tens of \nthousands of individuals who had similar names to persons on the watch \nlist were being misidentified and subjected to additional screening, \nand in some cases delayed so long as to miss their flights.\\18\\ We also \nreported that resolving these misidentifications can take time and, \ntherefore, affect air carriers and commerce. If changes in criteria \nresult in more individuals being added to the lists, this could also \nincrease the number of individuals who are misidentified, exacerbating \nthese negative effects. In addition, we explained that individuals who \nbelieve that they have been inappropriately matched to the watch list \ncan petition the Government for action and the relevant agencies must \nconduct research and work to resolve these issues. If more people are \nmisidentified, more people may trigger this redress process, increasing \nthe need for resources. Finally, any changes to the criteria or process \nwould have to ensure that watch list records are used in a manner that \nsafeguards legal rights, including freedoms, civil liberties, and \ninformation privacy guaranteed by Federal law.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\18\\ GAO-06-1031.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAgencies Do Not Screen Individuals Against All Records in the Watch \n        List, Which Creates Potential Security Vulnerabilities; GAO \n        Continues to Recommend That Agencies Assess and Address These \n        Gaps\n    In reacting to the December 25 attempted terrorist attack, \ndetermining whether there were potential vulnerabilities related to the \nuse of watch list records when screening--not only individuals who fly \ninto the country but also, for example, those who cross land borders--\nare important considerations. Screening agencies whose missions most \nfrequently and directly involve interactions with travelers generally \ndo not check against all records in the consolidated terrorist watch \nlist. In our October 2007 report, we noted that this is because \nscreening against certain records may not be needed to support a \nrespective agency's mission or may not be possible because of computer \nsystem limitations, among other things.\\19\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\19\\ GAO-08-110.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    For example, CBP's mission is to determine if any traveler is \neligible to enter the country or is to be denied entry because of \nimmigration or criminal violations. As such, CBP's computer system \naccepts all records from the consolidated watch list database that have \neither a first name or a last name and one other identifier, such as a \ndate of birth. Therefore, TSC sends CBP the greatest number of records \nfrom the consolidated watch list database for its screening. In \ncontrast, one of the State Department's missions is to approve requests \nfor visas. Since only non-U.S. citizens and nonlawful permanent \nresidents apply for visas, TSC does not send the department records on \ncitizens or lawful permanent residents for screening visa applicants.\n    Also, the FBI database that State and local law enforcement \nagencies use for their missions in checking individuals for criminal \nhistories, for example, also receives a smaller portion of the watch \nlist. According to the FBI, its computer system requires a full first \nname, last name, and other identifier, typically a date of birth. The \nFBI noted that this is because having these identifiers helps to reduce \nthe number of times an individual is misidentified as being someone on \nthe list, and the computer system would not be effective in making \nmatches without this information. Finally, the No-Fly and Selectee \nlists collectively contain the lowest percentage of watch list records \nbecause the remaining ones either do not meet the nominating criteria, \nas described above, or do not meet system requirements--that is, \ninclude full names and dates of birth, which TSA stated are required to \nminimize misidentifications.\n    TSA is implementing a new screening program that the agency states \nwill have the capability to screen an individual against the entire \nwatch list.\\20\\ Under this program, called Secure Flight, TSA will \nassume from air carriers the responsibility of comparing passenger \ninformation against the No-Fly and Selectee lists.\\21\\ According to the \nprogram's final rule, in general, Secure Flight is to compare passenger \ninformation only to the No-Fly and Selectee lists.\\22\\ The \nsupplementary information accompanying the rule notes that this will be \nsatisfactory to counter the security threat during normal security \ncircumstances. However, the rule provides that TSA may use the larger \nset of watch list records when warranted by security considerations, \nsuch as if TSA learns that flights on a particular route may pose \nincreased risks. TSA emphasized that use of the full terrorist \nscreening database is not routine. Rather, TSA noted that its use is \nlimited to circumstances in which there is information concerning an \nincreased risk to transportation security, and the decision to use the \nfull watch list database will be based on circumstances at the time. \nAccording to TSA, as of January 2010, the agency was developing \nadministrative procedures for utilizing the full watch list when \nwarranted.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\20\\ GAO-09-292.\n    \\21\\ Pub. L. No. 108-458, 4012(a), 118 Stat. 3638, 3714-15 \n(codified at 49 U.S.C. \u0006 44903(j)(2)(C)).\n    \\22\\ See 73 Fed. Reg. 64,018 (Oct. 28, 2008) (codified at 49 C.F.R. \npt. 1560).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    In late January 2009, TSA began to assume from airlines the watch \nlist matching function for a limited number of domestic flights, and \nhas since phased in additional flights and airlines. TSA expects to \nassume the watch list matching function for all domestic and \ninternational flights departing to and from the United States by \nDecember 2010. It is important to note that under the Secure Flight \nprogram, TSA requires airlines to provide the agency with each \npassenger's full name and date of birth to facilitate the watch list \nmatching process, which should reduce the number of individuals who are \nmisidentified as the subject of a watch list record. We continue to \nmonitor the Secure Flight program at the Congress's request.\n    In our October 2007 watch list report, we recommended that the FBI \nand DHS assess the extent to which security risks exist by not \nscreening against certain watch list records and what actions, if any, \nshould be taken in response.\\23\\ The agencies generally agreed with our \nrecommendations but noted that the risks related to not screening \nagainst all watch list records needs to be balanced with the impact of \nscreening against all records, especially those records without a full \nname and other identifiers. For example, more individuals could be \nmisidentified, law enforcement would be put in the position of \ndetaining more individuals until their identities could be resolved, \nand administrative costs could increase, without knowing what \nmeasurable increase in security is achieved. While we acknowledge these \ntradeoffs and potential impacts, we maintain that assessing whether \nvulnerabilities exist by not screening against all watch list records--\nand if there are ways to limit impacts--is critical and could be a \nrelevant component of the Government's on-going review of the watch \nlist process. Therefore, we believe that our recommendation continues \nto have merit.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\23\\ GAO-08-110.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIdentifying Additional Screening Opportunities and Determining Whether \n        There Are Clear Lines of Authority for and Accountability Over \n        the Watch List Process Would Help Ensure Its Effective Use\n    As we reported in October 2007, the Federal Government has made \nprogress in using the consolidated terrorist watch list for screening \npurposes, but has additional opportunities to use the list. For \nexample, DHS uses the list to screen employees in some critical \ninfrastructure components of the private sector, including certain \nindividuals who have access to vital areas of nuclear power plants or \ntransport hazardous materials. However, many critical infrastructure \ncomponents are not using watch list records, and DHS has not finalized \nguidelines to support such private sector screening, as HSPD-6 mandated \nand we previously recommended.\\24\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\24\\ The identification of critical infrastructure components that \nare not using watch list records for screening is considered Sensitive \nSecurity Information that cannot be disclosed in a public statement.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    In that same report, we noted that HSPD-11 tasked the Secretary of \nHomeland Security with coordinating across other Federal departments to \ndevelop: (1) A strategy for a comprehensive and coordinated \nwatchlisting and screening approach and (2) a prioritized \nimplementation and investment plan that describes the scope, \ngovernance, principles, outcomes, milestones, training objectives, \nmetrics, costs, and schedule of necessary activities.\\25\\ We reported \nthat without such a strategy, the Government could not provide \naccountability and a basis for monitoring to ensure that: (1) The \nintended goals for, and expected results of, terrorist screening are \nbeing achieved and (2) use of the watch list is consistent with privacy \nand civil liberties. We recommended that DHS develop a current \ninteragency strategy and related plans.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\25\\ The White House, Homeland Security Presidential Directive/\nHSPD-11, Subject: Comprehensive Terrorist-Related Screening Procedures \n(Washington, DC, Aug. 27, 2004).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    According to DHS's Screening Coordination Office, during the fall \nof 2007, the office led an interagency effort to provide the President \nwith an updated report, entitled, HSPD-11, An Updated Strategy for \nComprehensive Terrorist-Related Screening Procedures.\\26\\ The office \nnoted that the report was formally submitted to the Executive Office of \nthe President through the Homeland Security Council and reviewed by the \nPresident on January 25, 2008. Further, the office noted that it also \nprovided a sensitive version of the report to the Congress in October \n2008. DHS provided us an excerpt of that report to review, stating that \nit did not have the authority to share excerpts provided by other \nagencies, and we were unable to obtain a copy of the full report. The \ninformation we reviewed only discussed DHS's own efforts for \ncoordinating watch list screening across the Department. Therefore, we \nwere not able to determine whether the HSPD-11 report submitted to the \nPresident addressed all of the components called for in the directive \nor what action, if any, was taken as a result. We maintain that a \ncomprehensive strategy, as well as related implementation and \ninvestment plans, as called for by HSPD-11, continue to be important to \nensure effective Government-wide use of the watch list process.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\26\\ DHS established the Screening Coordination Office in July 2006 \nto enhance security measures by integrating the Department's terrorist-\nand immigration-related screening efforts, creating unified screening \nstandards and policies, and developing a single redress process for \ntravelers.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    In addition, in our October 2007 report, we noted that establishing \nan effective governance structure as part of this strategic approach is \nparticularly vital since numerous agencies and components are involved \nin the development, maintenance, and use of the watch list process, \nboth within and outside of the Federal Government. Also, establishing a \ngovernance structure with clearly-defined responsibility and authority \nwould help to ensure that agency efforts are coordinated, and that the \nFederal Government has the means to monitor and analyze the outcomes of \nsuch efforts and to address common problems efficiently and \neffectively. We determined at the time that no such structure was in \nplace and that no existing entity clearly had the requisite authority \nfor addressing interagency issues. We recommended that the Homeland \nSecurity Council ensure that a governance structure was in place, but \nthe council did not comment on our recommendation.\n    At the time of our report, TSC stated that it had a governance \nboard in place, comprised of senior-level agency representatives from \nnumerous departments and agencies. However, we also noted that the \nboard provided guidance concerning issues within TSC's mission and \nauthority. We also stated that while this governance board could be \nsuited to assume more of a leadership role, its authority at that time \nwas limited to TSC-specific issues, and it would need additional \nauthority to provide effective coordination of terrorist-related \nscreening activities and interagency issues Government-wide. In January \n2010, the FBI stated that TSC has a Policy Board in place, with \nrepresentatives from relevant departments and agencies, that reviews \nand provides input to the Government's watch list policy. The FBI also \nstated that the policies developed are then sent to the National \nSecurity Council Deputies Committee (formerly the Homeland Security \nCouncil) for ratification. The FBI noted that this process was used for \nmaking the most recent additions and changes to watch list standards \nand criteria. We have not yet been able to determine, however, whether \nthe Policy Board has the jurisdiction and authority to resolve issues \nbeyond TSC's purview, such as issues within the intelligence community \nand in regard to the nominations process, similar to the types of \ninteragency issues the December 25 attempted attack identified. We \nmaintain that a governance structure with the authority for and \naccountability over the entire watch list process, from nominations \nthrough screening, and across the Government is important.\n    On January 7, 2010, the President tasked the National Security \nStaff with initiating an interagency review of the watch list process--\nincluding the business processes, procedures, and criteria--and the \ninteroperability and sufficiency of supporting information technology \nsystems. This review offers the Government an opportunity to develop an \nupdated strategy, related plans, and governance structure that would \nprovide accountability to the administration, the Congress, and the \nAmerican public that the watch list process is effective at helping to \nsecure the homeland.\n   recent work highlights the importance of conducting vulnerability \n    assessments and operational testing prior to deployment of new \n                        checkpoint technologies\nWhile TSA Has Not Yet Deployed Any New Checkpoint Technologies \n        Nationwide, It Plans to Have Installed Almost 200 AITs by the \n        End of 2010\n    As we reported in October 2009, in an effort to improve the \ncapability to detect explosives at aviation passenger checkpoints, TSA \nhas 10 passenger screening technologies in various phases of research, \ndevelopment, procurement, and deployment, including the AIT (formerly \nWhole Body Imager).\\27\\ TSA is evaluating the AIT as an improvement \nover current screening capabilities of the metal detector and pat-downs \nspecifically to identify nonmetallic threat objects and liquids. The \nAITs produce an image of a passenger's body that a screener interprets. \nThe image identifies objects, or anomalies, on the outside of the \nphysical body but does not reveal items beneath the surface of the \nskin, such as implants. TSA plans to procure two types of AIT units: \nOne type uses millimeter wave and the other type uses backscatter X-ray \ntechnology. Millimeter wave technology beams millimeter wave radio \nfrequency energy over the body's surface at high speed from two \nantennas simultaneously as they rotate around the body.\\28\\ The energy \nreflected back from the body or other objects on the body is used to \nconstruct a three-dimensional image. Millimeter wave technology \nproduces an image that resembles a fuzzy photo negative. Backscatter X-\nray technology uses a low-level X-ray to create a two-sided image of \nthe person. Backscatter technology produces an image that resembles a \nchalk etching.\\29\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\27\\ GAO-10-128.\n    \\28\\ According to TSA, this description of the millimeter wave \ntechnology applies only to the machine manufactured by L3 and does not \napply to other millimeter wave technologies that TSA is evaluating, \nsuch as the Smiths millimeter wave AIT.\n    \\29\\ Research and development of the AIT technology is continuing, \nspecifically, to develop passive terahertz (THz) and active gigahertz \n(GHz) technologies to improve detection performance and reduce \noperational costs of commercially available systems.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    As we reported in October 2009, TSA has not yet deployed any new \ntechnologies Nation-wide. However, as of December 31, 2009, according \nto a senior TSA official, the agency has deployed 40 of the millimeter \nwave AITs, and has procured 150 backscatter X-ray units in fiscal year \n2009 and estimates that these units will be installed at airports by \nthe end of calendar year 2010. In addition, TSA plans to procure an \nadditional 300 AIT units in fiscal year 2010, some of which will be \npurchased with funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of \n2009.\\30\\ TSA plans to procure and deploy a total of 878 units at all \ncategory X through category IV airports.\\31\\ Full operating capability \nis expected in fiscal year 2014. TSA officials stated that the cost of \nthe AIT is about $130,000 to $170,000 per unit, excluding installation \ncosts. In addition, the estimated training costs are $50,000 per unit.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\30\\ According to TSA, some of the 300 AIT units to be procured in \nfiscal year 2010 will begin to be deployed to airports in the latter \nhalf of fiscal year 2010.\n    \\31\\ TSA classifies the commercial airports in the United States \ninto one of five security risk categories (X, I, II, III, and IV). In \ngeneral, category X airports have the largest number of passenger \nboardings, and category IV airports have the smallest. Categories X, I, \nII, and III airports account for more than 90 percent of the Nation's \nair traffic.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    While TSA stated that the AIT will enhance its explosives detection \ncapability, because the AIT presents a full body image of a person \nduring the screening process, concerns have been expressed that the \nimage is an invasion of privacy. According to TSA, to protect passenger \nprivacy and ensure anonymity, strict privacy safeguards are built into \nthe procedures for use of the AIT. For example, the officer who assists \nthe passenger never sees the image that the technology produces, and \nthe officer who views the image is remotely located in a secure \nresolution room and never sees the passenger. Officers evaluating \nimages are not permitted to take cameras, cell phones, or photo-enabled \ndevices into the resolution room. To further protect passengers' \nprivacy, ways have been introduced to blur the passengers' images. The \nmillimeter wave technology blurs all facial features, and the \nbackscatter X-ray technology has an algorithm applied to the entire \nimage to protect privacy. Further, TSA has stated that the AIT's \ncapability to store, print, transmit, or save the image will be \ndisabled at the factory before the machines are delivered to airports, \nand each image is automatically deleted from the system after it is \ncleared by the remotely located security officer. Once the remotely \nlocated officer determines that threat items are not present, that \nofficer communicates wirelessly to the officer assisting the passenger. \nThe passenger may then continue through the security process. Potential \nthreat items are resolved through a direct physical pat-down before the \npassenger is cleared to enter the sterile area.\\32\\ In addition to \nprivacy concerns, the AITs are large machines, and adding them to the \ncheckpoint areas will require additional space, especially since the \noperators are segregated from the checkpoint to help ensure passenger \nprivacy.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\32\\ TSA stated that it continues to evaluate possible display \noptions that include a ``stick figure'' or ``cartoonlike'' form to \nprovide greater privacy protection to the individual being screened \nwhile still allowing the unit operator or automated detection \nalgorithms to detect possible threats.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTSA Reports That It Is Taking Steps to Operationally Test AITs but Has \n        Not Conducted Vulnerability Assessments\n    We previously reported on several challenges TSA faces related to \nthe research, development, and deployment of passenger checkpoint \nscreening technologies and made a number of recommendations to improve \nthis process.\\33\\ Two of these recommendations are particularly \nrelevant today, as TSA moves forward with plans to install a total of \n878 additional AITs--completing operational testing of technologies in \nairports prior to using them in day-to-day operations and assessing \nwhether technologies such as the AIT are vulnerable to terrorist \ncountermeasures, such as hiding threat items on various parts of the \nbody to evade detection.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\33\\ GAO-10-128.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    First, in October 2009, we reported that TSA had relied on \ntechnologies in day-to-day airport operations that had not been proven \nto meet their functional requirements through operational testing and \nevaluation, contrary to TSA's acquisition guidance and a knowledge-\nbased acquisition approach. We also reported that TSA had not \noperationally tested the AITs at the time of our review, and we \nrecommended that TSA operationally test and evaluate technologies prior \nto deploying them.\\34\\ In commenting on our report, TSA agreed with \nthis recommendation. A senior TSA official stated that although TSA \ndoes not yet have a written policy requiring operational testing prior \nto deployment, TSA is now including in its contracts with vendors that \ncheckpoint screening machines are required to successfully complete \nlaboratory tests as well as operational tests. The test results are \nthen incorporated in the source selection plan. The official also \nstated that the test results are now required at key decision points by \nDHS's Investment Review Board. While recently providing GAO with \nupdated information to our October 2009 report, TSA stated that \noperational testing for the AIT was completed as of the end of calendar \nyear 2009. We are in the process of verifying that TSA has tested all \nof the AIT's functional requirements in an operational environment.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\34\\ Operational testing refers to testing in an operational \nenvironment in order to verify that new systems are operationally \neffective, supportable, and suitable.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Deploying technologies that have not successfully completed \noperational testing and evaluation can lead to cost overruns and \nunderperformance. TSA's procurement guidance provides that testing \nshould be conducted in an operational environment to validate that the \nsystem meets all functional requirements before deployment. In \naddition, our reviews have shown that leading commercial firms follow a \nknowledge-based approach to major acquisitions and do not proceed with \nlarge investments unless the product's design demonstrates its ability \nto meet functional requirements and be stable.\\35\\ The developer must \nshow that the product can be manufactured within cost, schedule, and \nquality targets and is reliable before production begins and the system \nis used in day-to-day operations.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\35\\ GAO, Best Practices: Using a Knowledge-Based Approach to \nImprove Weapon Acquisition, GAO-04-386SP (Washington, DC: January \n2004).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    TSA's experience with the ETPs, which the agency uses for secondary \nscreening, demonstrates the importance of testing and evaluation in an \noperational environment. The ETP detects traces of explosives on a \npassenger by using puffs of air to dislodge particles from the \npassenger's body and clothing that the machine analyzes for traces of \nexplosives. TSA procured 207 ETPs and in 2006 deployed 101 ETPs to 36 \nairports, the first deployment of a checkpoint technology initiated by \nthe agency.\\36\\ TSA deployed the ETPs even though agency officials were \naware that tests conducted during 2004 and 2005 on earlier ETP models \nsuggested that they did not demonstrate reliable performance. \nFurthermore, the ETP models that were subsequently deployed were not \nfirst tested to prove their effective performance in an operational \nenvironment, contrary to TSA's acquisition guidance, which recommends \nsuch testing. As a result, TSA procured and deployed ETPs without \nassurance that they would perform as intended in an operational \nenvironment. TSA officials stated that they deployed the machines \nwithout resolving these issues to respond quickly to the threat of \nsuicide bombers. In June 2006, TSA halted further deployment of the ETP \nbecause of performance, maintenance, and installation issues. According \nto a senior TSA official, as of December 31, 2009, all but 9 ETPs have \nbeen withdrawn from airports and 18 ETPs remain in inventory. TSA \nestimates that the 9 remaining ETPs will be removed from airports by \nthe end of calendar year 2010. In the future, using validated \ntechnologies would enhance TSA's efforts to improve checkpoint \nsecurity. Furthermore, retaining existing screening procedures until \nthe effectiveness of future technologies has been validated could \nprovide assurances that use of checkpoint technologies improves \naviation security.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\36\\ TSA deployed the ETPs from January to June 2006. Since June \n2006, TSA removed all but 9 ETPs from airports because of maintenance \nissues.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Second, as we reported in October 2009, TSA does not know whether \nits explosives detection technologies, such as the AITs, are \nsusceptible to terrorist tactics. Although TSA has obtained information \non vulnerabilities at the screening checkpoint, the agency has not \nassessed vulnerabilities--that is, weaknesses in the system that \nterrorists could exploit in order to carry out an attack--related to \npassenger screening technologies, such as AITs, that are currently \ndeployed. According to TSA's threat assessment, terrorists have various \ntechniques for concealing explosives on their persons, as was evident \nin Mr. Abdulmutallab's attempted attack on December 25, where he \nconcealed an explosive in his underwear. However, TSA has not assessed \nwhether these and other tactics that terrorists could use to evade \ndetection by screening technologies, such as AIT, increase the \nlikelihood that the screening equipment would not detect the hidden \nweapons or explosives. Thus, without an assessment of the \nvulnerabilities of checkpoint technologies, it is unclear whether the \nAIT or other technologies would have been able to detect the weapon Mr. \nAbdulmutallab used in his attempted attack. TSA is in the process of \ndeveloping a risk assessment for the airport checkpoints, but the \nagency has not yet completed this effort or clarified the extent to \nwhich this effort addresses any specific vulnerabilities in checkpoint \ntechnology.\n    TSA officials stated that to identify vulnerabilities at airport \ncheckpoints, the agency analyzes information such as the results from \nits covert testing program. TSA conducts National and local covert \ntests, whereby individuals attempt to enter the secure area of an \nairport through the passenger checkpoint with prohibited items in their \ncarry-on bags or hidden on their persons. However, TSA's covert testing \nprograms do not systematically test passenger and baggage screening \ntechnologies Nation-wide to ensure that they identify the threat \nobjects and materials the technologies are designed to detect, nor do \nthe covert testing programs identify vulnerabilities related to these \ntechnologies. We reported in August 2008 that while TSA's local covert \ntesting program attempts to identify test failures that may be caused \nby screening equipment not working properly or caused by screeners and \nthe screening procedures they follow, the agency's National testing \nprogram does not attribute a specific cause of a test failure.\\37\\ We \nrecommended, among other things, that TSA require the documentation of \nspecific causes of all National covert testing failures, including \ndocumenting failures related to equipment, in the covert testing \ndatabase to help TSA better identify areas for improvement. TSA \nconcurred with this recommendation and stated that the agency will \nexpand the covert testing database to document test failures related to \nscreening equipment.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\37\\ See GAO, Transportation Security: TSA Has Developed a Risk-\nBased Covert Testing Program, but Could Better Mitigate Aviation \nSecurity Vulnerabilities Identified Through Covert Tests, GAO-08-958 \n(Washington, DC: Aug. 8, 2008).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    In our 2009 report, we also recommended that the Assistant \nSecretary for TSA, among other actions, conduct a complete risk \nassessment--including threat, vulnerability, and consequence \nassessment--for the passenger screening program and incorporate the \nresults into TSA's program strategy, as appropriate. TSA and DHS \nconcurred with our recommendation, but have not completed these risk \nassessments or provided documentation to show how they have addressed \nthe concerns raised in our 2009 report regarding the susceptibility of \nthe technology to terrorist tactics.\n    Mr. Chairman, this concludes our statement for the record.\n                                 ______"

We write \ntoday to express our strong concern over the three substantive policy \nchanges that are being considered in the wake of the attempted terror \nattack on Christmas day: the wider deployment of whole body imaging \n(WBI) devices, the expanded use of terror watch lists and increased \nscreening of individuals from fourteen so-called nations of interest. \nThe ACLU believes that each of these changes greatly infringe on civil \nliberties and face serious questions regarding their efficacy in \nprotecting airline travelers.\n    The President has already identified a failure of intelligence as \nthe chief cause of the inability to detect the attempted terror attack \non Christmas day. As such, the Government's response must be directed \nto that end. These invasive and unjust airline security techniques \nrepresent a dangerous diversion of resources from the real problem. \nThis diversion of resources promises serious harm to American's privacy \nand civil liberties while failing to deliver significant safety \nimprovements.\n                            i. introduction\n    WBI uses millimeter wave or X-ray technology to produce graphic \nimages of passengers' bodies, essentially taking a naked picture of air \npassengers as they pass through security checkpoints. This technology \nis currently deployed at 19 airports and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity (DHS) recently announced the roll-out of 300 more machines by \nyear end.\\1\\ While initially described as a secondary screening \nmechanism, DHS is now stating that WBI will be used for primary \nscreening of passengers.\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\1\\ Harriet Baskas, Air security: Protection at privacy's expense? \nMsnbc.com, January 14, 2010. http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34846903/ns/\ntravel-tips/.\n    \\2\\ Paul Giblin and Eric Lipton, New Airport X-Rays Scan Bodies, \nNot Just Bags, New York Times, February 24, 2007.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Another way of screening passengers is through terror watch lists. \nThe terror watch lists are a series of lists of names of individuals \nsuspected of planning or executing terrorist attacks. The master list \nis maintained by the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) and contains more \nthan one million names.\\3\\ Subsets of this list include the No-Fly list \n(barring individuals from air travel) and the Automatic Selectee list \n(requiring a secondary screening). The names on this list and the \ncriteria for placement on these lists are secret.\\4\\ There is no \nprocess allowing individuals to challenge their placement on a list or \nseek removal from a list.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\3\\ The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Terrorist Watchlist \nNomination Practices, Justice Department, Office of the Inspector \nGeneral, Audit Report 09-25, May 2009, pg 3. http://www.justice.gov/\noig/reports/FBI/a0925/final.pdf.\n    \\4\\ Id at 70.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Finally, individuals who were born in, are citizens of, or are \ntraveling from fourteen nations will receive additional scrutiny under \na policy announced by the U.S. Government after the attempted terror \nattack. As of January 19, 2010 these nations are Afghanistan, Algeria, \nCuba, Iran, Lebanon, Libya, Iraq, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, \nSomalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n    The ACLU believes that Congress should apply the following two \nprinciples in evaluating any airline security measure:\n  <bullet> Efficacy. New security technologies must be genuinely \n        effective, rather than creating a false sense of security. The \n        wisdom supporting this principle is obvious: Funds to increase \n        aviation security are limited, and any technique or technology \n        must work and be substantially better than other alternatives \n        to deserve some of the limited funds available. It therefore \n        follows that before Congress invests in technologies or employs \n        new screening methods, it must demand evidence and testing from \n        neutral parties that these techniques have a likelihood of \n        success.\n  <bullet> Impact on Civil Liberties. The degree to which a proposed \n        measure invades privacy should be weighed in the evaluation of \n        any technology. If there are multiple effective techniques for \n        safeguarding air travel, the least intrusive technology or \n        technique should always trump the more invasive technology.\n ii. screening techniques and technologies must be effective, or they \n                    should not be utilized or funded\n    The wider deployment of whole body imaging (WBI) devices, expanded \nuse of terror watch lists and increased screening of individuals from \nfourteen so-called nations of interest each face significant questions \nregarding their efficacy in protecting air travelers and combating \nterrorism.\nWhole Body Imaging\n    There are no magic solutions or technologies for protecting air \ntravelers. Ben Wallace, a current member of the British parliament who \nadvised a research team at QinetiQ, a manufacturer of body screening \ndevices, has stated that their testing demonstrated that these \nscreening devices would not have discovered a bomb of the type used on \nChristmas day, as they failed to detect low density materials like \npowders, liquids and thin plastics.\\5\\ A current QinetiQ product \nmanager admitted that even their newest body scan technology probably \nwould not have detected the underwear bomb.\\6\\ The British press has \nalso reported that the British Department for Transport (DfT) and the \nBritish Home Office have already tested the scanners and were not \nconvinced they would work comprehensively against terrorist threats to \naviation.\\7\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\5\\ Jane Merrick, Are planned airport scanners just a scam? The \nIndependent, January 3, 2010.\n    \\6\\ Id.\n    \\7\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    In addition we know that al-Qaeda has already discovered a way to \nwork around this technology. In September a suicide bomber stowed a \nfull pound of high explosives and a detonator inside his rectum, and \nattempted to assassinate a Saudi prince by blowing himself up.\\8\\ While \nthe attack only slightly wounded the prince, it fully defeated an array \nof security measures including metal detectors and palace security. The \nbomber spent 30 hours in the close company of the prince's own secret \nservice agents--all without anyone suspecting a thing. WBI devices--\nwhich do not penetrate the body--would not have detected this device.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\8\\ Sheila MacVicar, Al Qaeda Bombers Learn from Drug Smugglers, \nCBSnews.com, September 28, 2009\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    The practical obstacles to effective deployment of body scanners \nare also considerable. In the United States alone, 43,000 TSA officers \nstaff numerous security gates at over 450 airports and over 2 million \npassengers a day.\\9\\ To avoid being an ineffective ``Maginot line,'' \nthese $170,000 machines will need to be put in place at all gates in \nall airports; otherwise a terrorist could just use an airport gate that \ndoes not have them. Scanner operators struggle constantly with boredom \nand inattention when tasked with the monotonous job of scanning \nthousands of harmless individuals when day after day, year after year, \nno terrorists come through their gate. In addition to the expense of \nbuying, installing, and maintaining these machines, additional \npersonnel will have to be hired to run them (unless they are shifted \nfrom other security functions, which will degrade those functions).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\9\\ http://www.tsa.gov/what_we_do/screening/\nsecurity_checkpoints.shtm.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    The efficacy of WBI devices must be weighed against not only their \nimpact on civil liberties (discussed further below) but also their \nimpact on the U.S. ability to implement other security measures. Every \ndollar spent on these technologies is a dollar that is not spent on \nintelligence analysis or other law enforcement activity. The President \nhas already acknowledged that it was deficiencies in those areas--not \naviation screening--that allowed Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to board an \nairplane.\nWatch Lists\n    The events leading up to the attempted Christmas attack are a \ntelling indictment of the entire watch list system. In spite of damning \ninformation, including the direct plea of Abdulmutallab's father, and \nother intelligence gathered about terrorist activity in Yemen, \nAbdulmutallab was not placed into the main Terrorist Screening \nDatabase. We believe that fact can be directly attributed to the \nbloated and overbroad nature of the list--now at more than a million \nnames.\\10\\ The size of the list creates numerous false positives, \nwastes resources, and hides the real threats to aviation security. As \nwe discuss below it also sweeps up many innocent Americans--falsely \nlabeling them terrorists and providing them with no mechanism for \nremoving themselves from the list.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\10\\ DOJ OIG Audit Report 09-25, pg 3. http://www.justice.gov/oig/\nreports/FBI/a0925/final.pdf.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    These problems are not hypothetical. They have real consequences \nfor law enforcement and safety. An April 2009 report from the Virginia \nFusion Center states"

"","","richardson","Honorable Laura Richardson","``According to 2008 Terrorism Screening Center ground encounter data, \nal-Qa'ida was one of the three most frequently encountered groups in \nVirginia. In 2007, at least 414 encounters between suspected al-Qa'ida \nmembers and law enforcement or government officials were documented in \nthe Commonwealth. Although the vast majority of encounters involved \nautomatic database checks for air travel, a number of subjects were \nencountered by law enforcement officers.''\\11\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\11\\ Virginia Fusion Center, 2009 Virginia Terrorism Threat \nAssessment, March 2009, pg 27.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Every time a law enforcement officer encounters someone on the \nterrorist watch list (as determined by a check of the National Crime \nInformation Center (NCIC) database) they contact the TSC. So in essence \nVirginia law enforcement is reporting that there are more than 400 al-\nQaeda terrorists in Virginia in a given year. This is difficult to \nbelieve.\\12\\ In reality most, if not all, of these stops are false \npositives, mistakes regarding individuals who should not be on the \nlist.

"","","richardson","Honorable Laura Richardson","This should be the end of the discussions. Policies that don't work \nhave no place in aviation security. When they are actively harmful--\nwasting resources and making us less safe--they should be stopped as \nquickly as possible.\n iii. the impact on privacy and civil liberties must be weighed in any \n               assessment of aviation security techniques\n    Each of the three aviation security provisions discussed in these \nremarks represents a direct attack on fundamental American values. As \nsuch they raise serious civil liberties concerns.\nWhole Body Imaging\n    WBI technology involves a striking and direct invasion of privacy. \nIt produces strikingly graphic images of passengers' bodies, \nessentially taking a naked picture of air passengers as they pass \nthrough security checkpoints. It is a virtual strip search that reveals \nnot only our private body parts, but also intimate medical details like \ncolostomy bags. Many people who wear adult diapers feel they will be \nhumiliated. That degree of examination amounts to a significant assault \non the essential dignity of passengers. Some people do not mind being \nviewed naked but many do and they have a right to have their integrity \nhonored.\n    This technology should not be used as part of a routine screening \nprocedure, but only when the facts and circumstances suggest that it is \nthe most effective method for a particular individual. And such \ntechnology may be used in place of an intrusive search, such as a strip \nsearch--when there is reasonable suspicion sufficient to support such a \nsearch.\n    TSA is also touting privacy safeguards including blurring of faces, \nthe non-retention of images, and the viewing of images only by \nscreeners in a separate room. Scanners with such protections are \ncertainly better than those without; however, we are still skeptical of \ntheir suggested safeguards such as obscuring faces and not retaining \nimages.\n    Obscuring faces is just a software fix that can be undone as easily \nas it is applied. And obscuring faces does not hide the fact that rest \nof the body will be vividly displayed. A policy of not retaining images \nis a protection that would certainly be a vital step for such a \npotentially invasive system, but it is hard to see how this would be \nachieved in practice. TSA would almost certainly have to create \nexceptions--for collecting evidence of a crime or for evaluation of the \nsystem (such as in the event of another attack) for example--and it is \na short step from there to these images appearing on the internet.\n    Intrusive technologies are often introduced very gingerly with all \nmanner of safeguards and protections, but once the technology is \naccepted the protections are stripped away. There are substantial \nreasons for skepticism regarding TSA promised protections for WBI \ndevices. In order for these protections to be credible Congress must \nenshrine them in law.\n    Finally, the TSA should invest in developing other detection \nsystems that are less invasive, less costly, and less damaging to \nprivacy. For example, ``trace portal detection'' particle detectors \nhold the promise of detecting explosives while posing little challenge \nto flyers' privacy. A 2002 Homeland Security report urged the \n``immediate deployment'' of relatively inexpensive explosive trace \ndetectors in European airports, as did a 2005 report to Congress, yet \naccording to a 2006 Associated Press article, these efforts ``were \nfrustrated inside Homeland Security by `bureaucratic games', a lack of \nstrategic goals and months-long delays in distributing money Congress \nhad already approved.''\\18\\ Bureaucratic delay and mismanagement should \nnot be allowed to thwart the development of more effective explosive \ndetection technologies that do not have the negative privacy impact of \nWBI devices.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\18\\ John Solomon, Bureaucracy Impedes Bomb Detection Work, \nWashington Post, Aug. 12, 2006, at: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-\ndyn/content/article/2006/08/12/AR2006081200269.html.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWatch Lists\n    The creation of terrorist watch lists--literally labeling \nindividuals as a terrorist--has enormous civil liberties impact. It \nmeans on-going and repetitive harassment at all airports--foreign and \ndomestic, constant extra screening, searches and invasive questions. \nFor the many innocent individuals on the lists this is humiliating and \ninfuriating.\n    For some it is worse. Individuals on the No-Fly list are denied a \nfundamental right, the right to travel and move about the country \nfreely. Others are threatened with the loss of their job. Erich \nSherfen, commercial airline pilot and Gulf War veteran, has been \nthreatened with termination from his job as a pilot because his name \nappears on a Government watch list, which prevents him from entering \nthe cockpit.\\19\\ Sherfen is not the only innocent person placed on a \nterror watch list. Other individuals who are either on a list or \nmistaken for those on the list include a former Assistant Attorney \nGeneral, many individuals with the name Robert Johnson, the late \nSenator Edward Kennedy and even Nelson Mandela.\\20\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\19\\ Jeanne Meserve, Name on government watch list threatens \npilot's career, CNN.com, August 22, 2008, http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/\n08/22/pilot.watch.list/index.html?iref=newssearch.\n    \\20\\ For details on these individuals and many other please see: \nhttp://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/unlikelysuspects.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    The most recent case--revealed just last week--is that of Mikey \nHicks, an 8-year-old boy who has been on the Selectee list seemingly \nsince birth. According to Hicks' family their travel tribulations that \nbegan when Mikey was an infant. When he was 2 years old, the kid was \npatted down at airport security. He's now, by all accounts, an \nunassuming bespectacled Boy Scout who has been stopped every time he \nflies with his family.\\21\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\21\\ Lizette Alvarez, Meet Mikey, 8: U.S. Has Him on Watch List, \nNew York Times, January 13, 2010.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    In addition, to stops at the airport watch list information is also \nplaced in the National Criminal Information Center database. That means \nlaw enforcement routinely run names against the watch lists for matters \nas mundane as traffic stops. It's clear that innocent individuals may \nbe harassed even if they don't attempt to fly.\n    Nor is there any due process for removing individuals from the \nlist--there is simply no process for challenging the Government's \ncontention that you are a terrorist. Even people who are mistaken for \nthose on the list face challenges. A September 2009 report by the \nInspector General of the Department of Homeland Security found that the \nprocess for clearing innocent travelers from the list is a complete \nmess.\\22\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\22\\ Effectiveness of the Department of Homeland Security Traveler \nRedress Inquiry Program, Department of Homeland Security, Office of the \nInspector General OIG 09-10, September 2009. http://www.dhs.gov/xoig/\nassets/mgmtrpts/OIG-09-103r_Sep09.pdf.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    In light of the significant and on-going harm to innocent Americans \nas well as the harm to our National security caused by the diversion of \nsecurity resources these watch lists must be substantial reduced in \nsize and fundamental due process protections imposed. Innocent \ntravelers must be able to remove themselves from the list both for \ntheir sake and the sake of National security.\nAviation Screening on the Basis of Nationality\n    This history of the civil rights movement in the 20th and 21st \nCentury is a long, compelling rejection of the idea that individuals \nshould be treated differently on the basis of their race or nation of \norigin. Because of that, the administration's decision to subject the \ncitizens of fourteen nations flying to the United States to intensified \nscreening is deeply troubling. Long-standing constitutional principles \nrequire that no administrative searches, either by technique or \ntechnology, be applied in a discriminatory matter. The ACLU opposes the \ncategorical use of profiles based on race, religion, ethnicity, or \ncountry of origin. This practice is nothing less than racial profiling. \nSuch profiling is ineffective and counter to American values.\n    But the harm that profiling on the basis of national origin does to \ncivil liberties is not an abstraction--it also has direct impact on \nAmerican security interests. These harmful policies have a direct \nimpact on the Muslim and Arab communities. The Senate Homeland Security \nand Government Affairs committee has heard testimony from several \nwitnesses who cited the growth of Islamophobia and the polarization of \nthe Muslim community as risk factors that could raise the potential for \nextremist violence.\\23\\ Unfairly focusing suspicion on a vulnerable \ncommunity tends to create the very alienation and danger that we need \nto avoid.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\23\\ See for example, Hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Violent Islamist Extremism: The \nEuropean Experience, (June 27, 2007), particularly the testimony of \nLidewijde Ongering and Marc Sageman, available at: http://\nhsgac.senate.gov/public/\nindex.cfm?FuseAction=Hearings.Hearing&Hearing_ID=9c8ef805-75c8-48c2-\n810dd778af31cca6.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Indeed a recent United Kingdom analysis based on hundreds of case \nstudies of individuals involved in terrorism reportedly identified \n``facing marginalization and racism'' as a key vulnerability that could \ntend to make an individual receptive to extremist ideology.\\24\\ The \nconclusion supporting tolerance of diversity and protection of civil \nliberties was echoed in a National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) paper \npublished in August 2008. In exploring why there was less violent \nhomegrown extremism in the United States than the United Kingdom, the \nauthors cited the diversity of American communities and the greater \nprotection of civil rights as key factors.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\24\\ National Counterterrorism Center Conference Report, Towards a \nDomestic Counterradicalization Strategy, (August 2008)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    At the January 7, 2009 White House briefing regarding the security \nfailures surrounding the Christmas attack, DHS Secretary Janet \nNapolitano raised a question about ``counterradicalization.''\\25\\ She \nasked, ``How do we communicate better American values and so forth, in \nthis country but also around the globe?'' Of course the Secretary \nshould know American values are communicated through U.S. Government \npolicies, which is why adopting openly discriminatory policies can be \nso damaging and counterproductive to our National interests.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\25\\ Briefing by Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano, Assistant \nto the President for Counterterrorism and Homeland Security Brennan, \nand Press Secretary Gibbs, 1/7/10, at: http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-\npressoffice/briefing-homeland-security-secretary-napolitano-assistant-\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                             iv. conclusion\n    Ultimately security is never absolute and never will be. It is not \nwise security policy to spend heavily to protect against one particular \ntype of plot, when the number of terrorist ideas that can be hatched--\nnot only against airlines, but also against other targets--is \nlimitless. The President has identified a failure ``connect the dots'' \nby intelligence analysts as the main reason that Umar Farouk \nAbdulmutallab was able to board a flight to the United States.\\26\\ We \nmust not lose sight of that reality. Limited security dollars should be \ninvested where they will do the most good and have the best chance of \nthwarting attacks. That means investing them in developing competent \nintelligence and law enforcement agencies that will identify specific \nindividuals who represent a danger to air travel and arrest them or \ndeny them a visa.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\26\\ Jake Tapper and Sunlen Miller, Obama: Intelligence Community \nFailed to ``Connect the Dots'' in a ``Potentially Disastrous Way'', \nABCNews.com, January 05, 2010. http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/\n2010/01/obamaintelligence-community-failed-to-connect-the-dots-in-a-\npotentially-disastrous-way.html.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Invasive screening mechanisms, enlarging already bloated watch \nlists, targeting on the basis of national origin--none of these \napproaches go to the heart of what went wrong on Christmas day. Instead \nthey are a dangerous sideshow--one that harms our civil liberties and \nultimately makes us less safe."

Thank you for this opportunity to \ntestify on the attempted attack on December 25.\n    Secretary Napolitano, Mr. Chairman, as you noted, was \nscheduled to be out of the country. In view of that, although \nher plans have changed, we have been in touch with your staff \nthat I would be here to testify for the Department.\n    As President Obama made clear immediately following the \nattack, at the Department of Homeland Security and across the \nFederal Government, we are determined to find and fix the \nvulnerabilities that led to this breach.\n    Protecting the United States against terrorism calls upon \nthe expertise and authority of multiple agencies and many \npartners. In addition to the men and women of the Department of \nHomeland Security, this includes the efforts of the departments \nof State, Defense, Justice, FBI, NCTC, and the broader \nintelligence community. It also importantly includes our State \nand local law enforcement agencies and our international \npartners and allies around the world.\n    I am very pleased this morning to be joined by my \ncolleagues from the Department of State and the National \nCounterterrorism Center.\n    As this committee is well aware of, Mr. Chairman, boarding \nthe plane means fulfilling three basic requirements. The \nindividual must retain proper documentation, including a \npassport, visa, or other travel authorization, a ticket, and \nboarding pass. He or she must pass through the checkpoint \nscreening to ensure that they are not concealing a dangerous \nweapon or other dangerous material on their person or in their \nbaggage.\n    Finally, the individual must be cleared through a pre-\nflight screening process that seeks to determine if that \nindividual poses a threat to the homeland security and thus \nshould be denied permission to fly.\n    Within this set of requirements, let me briefly describe \nthe specific role the Department of Homeland Security plays. \nFirst, to conduct pre-flight screening, the Department is one \nof the principal consumers of intelligence gathered by other \nagencies, including the terrorist watch list, which includes \nthe No-Fly list. DHS checks passengers against these lists to \nkeep potential terrorists from boarding flights and to identify \ntravelers who should undergo additional screening.\n    Second, within the United States, DHS performs the physical \nscreening at domestic airport checkpoints and provides further \nin-flight security measures in order to prevent smuggling of \nweapons or other dangerous materials on airplanes.\n    Third, outside of the United States, the Department works \nwith foreign governments and airlines to advise them on the \nrequired security measures for flights bound for the United \nStates and on which passengers may prove a threat. TSA nor any \nother part of the Department, however, does not screen people \nor baggage at international airports.\n    Let me say emphatically, as the President of the United \nStates has said and as the Secretary of Homeland Security has \nsaid, that with regard to the attempted attack on December 25, \nOmar Farouk Abdulmutallab should never have been allowed to \nboard a U.S.-bound airplane with explosives. As Secretary \nNapolitano has detailed in recent weeks, DHS has implemented \nnumerous steps and is working closely with our Federal partners \nto fix the vulnerabilities that led to the attempted attack.\n    As a consumer or a terrorist watch list information, the \nDepartment works closely with the FBI, with the Office of the \nDirector of National Intelligence and NCTC to improve our \nability to connect and assimilate intelligence. We are also \ntaking steps to strengthen standards for international aviation \nscreening and bolstering international partnerships to guard \nagainst a similar type of attack.\n    But to be clear, Abdulmutallab was not on the No-Fly list \nand hence, did not come to our attention prior to his boarding \nthe flight in Amsterdam. His presence on this list would have \nflagged him to be prevented from boarding. He was not either on \nthe Selectee list, which would have flagged him for secondary \nscreening. Furthermore, the physical screenings that were \nperformed by foreign authorities at the airports in Nigeria and \nthe Netherlands failed to detect the explosive on his person.\n    Immediately following the attempted attack, the Department \ntook steps to secure incoming and future flights. We directed \nthe FAA to alert all 128 flights inbound to the United States \nfrom Europe of the situation. We increased security measures at \ndomestic airports. We implemented an enhanced screening for all \ninternational flights coming into the United States, and we \nreached out to State and local law enforcement, air carriers, \ninternational partners, and relevant agencies to provide \ninformation they needed on the ground to take appropriate \nmeasures.\n    In January 3, Secretary Napolitano dispatched me and my \ncolleagues in the Department to meet with international \nleadership on the crisis in aviation security that was \nillustrated through the events of 12/25. We met with senior \nofficials from 11 countries, plus the European Union, to \ndiscuss ways to strengthen aviation security, and we are \ndetermined to follow through on these contacts. I can report, \nas questioned, Mr. Chairman, on the results of those \ndiscussions.\n    The Secretary has herself been in touch with international \ncolleagues to identify ways to strengthen the international \naviation security standards and procedures.\n    As the Secretary said last week, and as the President has \nsaid, there are no 100 percent guarantees against another \nterrorist attempt to take down a plane or attack us in some \nother fashion. But what we can give you, Mr. Chairman, is the \n100 percent commitment of the Secretary, myself, Department \nleadership, and the hundreds of thousands of men and women who \nwork in homeland security to do everything we can to minimize \nthe risk of terrorist attack.\n    Thank you again for this opportunity, Mr. Chairman, to \nappear before this committee. I look forward to your questions."

"lute","Jane Holl Lute","richardson","Honorable Laura Richardson","                            January 27, 2010\n    Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member King, and Members of the \ncommittee: Thank you for this opportunity to testify on the attempted \nterrorist attack on Northwest Flight 253.\n    The attempted attack on December 25 was a powerful illustration \nthat terrorists will go to great lengths to defeat the security \nmeasures that have been put in place since September 11, 2001. This \nadministration is determined to thwart those plans and disrupt, \ndismantle, and defeat terrorist networks by employing multiple layers \nof defense that work in concert with one another to secure our country. \nThis is an effort that involves not just DHS, but many other Federal \nagencies and the international community as well.\n    As our part in this effort, DHS is a consumer of the U.S. \nGovernment's consolidated terrorist watch list, which we use to help \nkeep potential terrorists off flights within, over, or bound for the \nUnited States, and to identify travelers that require additional \nscreening. We work with foreign governments, Interpol, and air carriers \nto strengthen global air travel security by advising them on security \nmeasures, and on which passengers may prove a threat. We also work with \nair carriers and airport authorities to perform physical screening at \nTSA checkpoints and to provide security measures in flight.\n    Immediately following the December 25 attack, DHS took swift action \nat airports across the country and around the world. These steps \nincluded enhancing screening for individuals flying to the United \nStates; increasing the presence of law enforcement and explosives \ndetection canine teams at airports, and of air marshals in flight; and \ndirecting the FAA to notify the 128 flights already in-bound from \nEurope about the situation. Nonetheless, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab \nshould never have been able to board a U.S.-bound plane with the \nexplosive PETN on his person. As President Obama has made clear, this \nadministration is determined to find and fix the vulnerabilities in our \nsystems that allowed this breach to occur.\n    Agencies across the Federal Government have worked quickly to \naddress what went wrong in the Abdulmutallab case. The effort to solve \nthese problems is well underway, with cooperation among DHS, the \nDepartment of State, the Department of Justice, the intelligence \ncommunity, and our international allies, among others. As a consumer of \nterrorist watch list information, the Department of Homeland Security \nwelcomes the opportunity to contribute to the dialogue on improving the \nFederal Government's ability to connect and assimilate intelligence. We \nare also focused on improving aviation screening and expanding our \ninternational partnerships to guard against a similar type of attack \noccurring again. To those ends, today I want to describe the role that \nDHS currently performs in aviation security, how DHS responded in the \nimmediate aftermath of the attempted attack on December 25, and how we \nare moving forward to further bolster aviation security.\n                dhs' role in multiple layers of defense\n    Since 9/11, the U.S. Government has employed multiple layers of \ndefense across several departments to secure the aviation sector and \nensure the safety of the traveling public. Different Federal agencies \nbear different responsibilities, while other countries and the private \nsector--especially the air carriers themselves--also have important \nroles to play.\n    DHS oversees several programs to prevent individuals with terrorist \nties from boarding flights that are headed to, within, or traveling \nover the United States or, in appropriate cases, to identify them for \nadditional screening. Specifically, DHS uses information held in the \nTerrorist Screening Database (TSDB), a resource managed by the \nTerrorist Screening Center (TSC), as well as other information provided \nthrough the intelligence community, to screen individuals; operates the \ntravel authorization program for people who are traveling to the United \nStates under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP);\\1\\ and works with foreign \ngovernments, international, and regional organizations, and airlines to \ndesign and implement improved security standards worldwide. This \nincludes routine checks against Interpol databases on wanted persons \nand lost or stolen passports on all international travelers arriving in \nthe United States. The Department also performs checkpoint screenings \nat airports in the United States.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\1\\ The 35 countries in the Visa Waiver Program are: Andorra, \nAustralia, Austria, Belgium, Brunei, the Czech Republic, Denmark, \nEstonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, \nJapan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, the \nNetherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Singapore, \nSlovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the \nUnited Kingdom (for the United Kingdom, only citizens with an \nunrestricted right of permanent abode in the United Kingdom are \neligible for VWP travel authorizations).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    To provide a sense of the scale of our operations, every day, U.S. \nCustoms and Border Protection (CBP) processes 1.2 million travelers \nseeking to enter the United States by land, air, or sea; the \nTransportation Security Administration (TSA) screens 1.8 million \ntravelers at domestic airports; and DHS receives advanced passenger \ninformation from carriers operating in 245 international airports that \nare the last point of departure for flights to the United States, \naccounting for about 1,600 to 1,800 flights per day. Ensuring that DHS \nemployees and all relevant Federal officials are armed with \nintelligence and information is critical to the success of these \nefforts.\nSafeguards for Visas and Travel\n    One of the first layers of defense in securing air travel consists \nof safeguards to prevent dangerous people from obtaining visas, travel \nauthorizations, and boarding passes. To apply for entry to the United \nStates prior to boarding flights bound for the United States or \narriving at a U.S. port of entry, most foreign nationals need visas--\nissued by a U.S. embassy or consulate--or, if traveling under a Visa \nWaiver Program country, travel authorizations issued through the \nElectronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA).\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\2\\ Exceptions would be citizens of countries under other visa \nwaiver authority such as the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative or \nthe separate visa waiver program for Guam and the Commonwealth of the \nNorthern Mariana Islands, or those granted individual waivers of the \nvisa requirement under the immigration laws.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Issuing visas is the responsibility of the Department of State. At \nembassies and consulates where it is operational, the Visa Security \nProgram positions personnel of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n(ICE) to assist State Department personnel in identifying visa \napplicants who may present a security threat. For individuals traveling \nunder the VWP, DHS operates ESTA, a web-based system through which \nindividuals must apply for travel authorization prior to traveling to \nthe United States. These systems examine an individual's information to \nassess whether he or she could pose a risk to the United States or its \ncitizens, including possible links to terrorism. Without presenting a \nvalid authorization to travel to the United States at the airport of \ndeparture, a foreign national is not able to board a U.S.-bound flight.\n    The Department also works with other Federal agencies and our \nforeign partners to try to prevent possible terrorists from obtaining \nboarding passes. These include the application of the No-Fly List and \nthe implementation of Secure Flight program, which I explain below.\nPre-departure screening\n    As another layer of defense, DHS conducts pre-departure passenger \nscreening in partnership with the airline industry and foreign \ngovernments in order to prevent known or suspected terrorists from \nboarding a plane bound for the United States or, as appropriate, to \nidentify them for additional screening. DHS uses TSDB data, managed by \nthe Terrorist Screening Center that is administered by the FBI, to \ndetermine who may board, who requires further screening and \ninvestigation, who should not be admitted, or who should be referred to \nappropriate law enforcement personnel.\n    Specifically, to help make these determinations, DHS uses the No-\nFly List and the Selectee List, two important subsets within the TSDB. \nIndividuals on the No-Fly List should not receive a boarding pass for a \nflight to, from, over, or within the United States. Individuals on the \nSelectee List must go through additional security measures, including a \nfull-body pat-down and a full physical examination of personal effects.\n    Through the Secure Flight Program, the Department is making an \nimportant change to the process of matching passenger identities \nagainst the No-Fly List and Selectee List, and fulfilling an important \nrecommendation of the 9/11 Commission. Previously, responsibility for \nchecking passenger manifests against these lists rested with the air \ncarriers themselves. Under the Secure Flight program, DHS began to \ntransfer this responsibility to TSA in 2009, and the transition is \ntargeted for completion by the end of this year. In addition to \ncreating a more consistent matching process for all domestic and \ninternational travel to the United States and strengthening the \neffectiveness of redress in preventing misidentifications, Secure \nFlight will flag potential watch list matches and immediately trigger \nlaw enforcement notification and coordination.\n    As an additional layer of security, DHS also uses the Passenger \nName Record (PNR), the Advanced Passenger Information System (APIS), \nand the Immigration Advisory Program (IAP) to assess a passenger's \nlevel of risk and, when necessary, flag them for further inspection. \nPNR data, obtained from the airline reservations systems, contains \nvarious elements, which may include optional information on itinerary, \nco-travelers, changes to the reservation, and payment information. PNR \ndata is evaluated against ``targeting rules'' that are based on law \nenforcement data, intelligence and past case experience. APIS data, \nwhich carriers are required to provide to DHS at least 30 minutes \nbefore a flight, contains important identifying information that may \nnot be included in PNR data, including verified identity and travel \ndocument information such as a traveler's date of birth, citizenship, \nand travel document number. DHS screens APIS information on \ninternational flights to or from the United States against the TSDB, as \nwell as against criminal history information, records of lost or stolen \npassports, and prior immigration or customs violations. APIS is also \nconnected to Interpol's lost and stolen passport database for routine \nqueries on all inbound international travelers.\n    Another layer in the screening process is the Immigration Advisory \nProgram (IAP). The CBP officers stationed overseas under the IAP \nprogram at nine airports in seven countries receive referrals from CBP \nscreening against the TSDB, of which the No-Fly list is a subset. IAP \nofficers can make ``no board'' recommendations to carriers and host \ngovernments regarding passengers bound for the United States who may \nconstitute security risks, but do not have the authority to arrest, \ndetain, or prevent passengers from boarding planes.\nCheckpoint Screenings and In-Flight Security\n    The third layer of defense for air travel in which DHS plays a role \nis the screening of passengers and their baggage. TSA screens \npassengers and baggage at airports in the United States, but not in \nother countries. When a traveler at a foreign airport is physically \nscreened, that screening is conducted by the foreign government, air \ncarriers, or the respective airport authority.\n    Domestically, TSA employs a layered approach to security, which \nincludes measures both seen and unseen by travelers. The 48,000 \nTransportation Security Officers at hundreds of airports across the \ncountry screen passengers and their baggage using advanced technology \nX-ray systems, walk-through metal detectors, explosive trace detection \nequipment, trained canines, vapor trace machines that detect liquid \nexplosives, Advanced Imaging Technology, full-body pat-downs, \nexplosives detection systems, Bomb Appraisal Officers, and Behavior \nDetection Officers--both at the checkpoint and throughout the airport. \nThrough programs such as the Aviation Direct Access Screening Program, \nTSA also uses random and unpredictable measures to enhance security \nthroughout the airport perimeter and in limited access areas of \nairports. The $1 billion in Recovery Act funds provided to TSA for \ncheckpoint and checked baggage screening technology have enabled TSA to \ngreatly accelerate deployment of these critical tools to keep \npassengers safe.\n    In an effort to enhance international screening standards, TSA \nconducts security assessments in accordance with security standards \nestablished by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) at \nmore than 300 foreign airports, which include foreign airports from \nwhich flights operate directly to the United States and all airports \nfrom which U.S. air carriers operate. If an airport does not meet these \nstandards, TSA works with the host government to rectify the \ndeficiencies and raise airport security to an acceptable level. \nUltimately, it is the foreign government that must work to address \nthese security issues.\n    In long-term circumstances of non-compliance with international \nstandards, TSA may recommend suspension of flight service from these \nairports to the United States. In addition, TSA inspects all U.S. and \nforeign air carriers that fly to the United States from each airport to \nensure compliance with TSA standards and directives. Should air carrier \nsecurity deficiencies exist, TSA works with the air carrier to raise \ncompliance to an acceptable level. If an airport is located within one \nof the 35 VWP countries, DHS conducts additional audits and inspections \nas part of the statutorily mandated VWP designation and review process.\n    In terms of in-flight security, Federal Air Marshals (FAM) are \ndeployed on high-risk domestic and international flights where \ninternational partners allow FAMs to enter their country on U.S.-\nflagged carriers. Thousands more volunteer pilots serve as armed, \ndeputized Federal Flight Deck Officers. Additionally, armed law \nenforcement officers from Federal, State, local, and tribal law \nenforcement agencies that have a need to fly armed provide a force \nmultiplier on many flights.\n            dhs response to the attempted december 25 attack\n    The facts of the December 25 attempted bombing are well established \nand were relayed in the report on the incident that the President \nreleased on January 7, 2010. On December 16, 2009, Umar Farouk \nAbdulmutallab, a Nigerian national, purchased a round-trip ticket from \nLagos, Nigeria to Detroit. Abdulmutallab went through physical security \nscreening conducted by foreign airport personnel at Murtala Muhammed \nInternational Airport in Lagos on December 24 prior to boarding a \nflight to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. This physical screening included \nan X-ray of his carry-on luggage and his passing through a walk-through \nmetal detector. Abdulmutallab went through additional physical \nscreening, conducted by Dutch authorities, when transiting through \nAmsterdam to Northwest Flight 253 to Detroit, and presented a valid \nU.S. visa. Abdulmutallab was not on the No-Fly or Selectee Lists. \nAccordingly, the carrier was not alerted to prevent him from boarding \nthe flight or additional physical screening, nor did the IAP officer \nadvise Dutch authorities of any concerns.\n    As with all passengers traveling on that flight, and similar to all \nother international flights arriving in the United States, CBP \nevaluated Abdulmutallab's information while the flight was en route to \nconduct a preliminary assessment of his admissibility and to determine \nwhether there were requirements for additional inspection. During this \nassessment, CBP noted that there was a record that had been received \nfrom the Department of State, which indicated possible extremist ties. \nIt did not indicate that he had been found to be a threat, or that his \nvisa had been revoked. CBP officers in Detroit were prepared to meet \nAbdulmutallab upon his arrival for further interview and inspection. \nThe attack on board the flight failed in no small part due to the brave \nactions of the crew and passengers aboard the plane.\nImmediate DHS Response\n    Following the first reports of an attempted terrorist attack on \nNorthwest Flight 253 on December 25, DHS immediately put in place \nadditional security measures. TSA directed the Federal Aviation \nAdministration to apprise 128 U.S.-bound international flights from \nEurope of the attempted attack and to ask them to maintain heightened \nvigilance on their flights. Increased security measures were put in \nplace at domestic airports, including additional explosive detection \ncanine teams, State and local law enforcement, expanded presence of \nBehavior Detection Officers, and enhanced screening. That evening, DHS \nissued a security directive for all international flights to the United \nStates, which mandated enhanced screening prior to departure and \nadditional security measures during flight.\n    From the first hours following the attempted attack, Secretary \nNapolitano worked closely with the President, senior Department \nleadership, and agencies across the Federal Government. Secretary \nNapolitano and I communicated with international partners and Members \nof Congress. The Secretary also engaged in dialogue with State and \nlocal leadership, the aviation industry, and with National security \nexperts on counterterrorism and aviation security. The results of these \ncommunications culminated in two reports to the President: one on New \nYear's Eve and the second on January 2, 2010.\n    One of our most important conclusions was that it is now clearer \nthan ever that air travel security is an international responsibility. \nIndeed, passengers from 17 countries were aboard Flight 253. \nAccordingly, DHS has embarked upon an aggressive international program \ndesigned to raise international standards for airports and air safety. \nOn January 3, 2010, Secretary Napolitano dispatched me and Assistant \nSecretary for Policy David Heyman to Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle \nEast, Australia, and South America to meet with international \nleadership on aviation security. In total, we met with senior officials \nfrom 11 countries, plus the European Union in order to discuss new ways \nto bolster collective tactics for improving global aviation security. \nLast week, Secretary Napolitano travelled to Spain to meet with her \nEuropean Union counterparts in the first of a series of global meetings \nintended to bring about broad consensus on new, stronger, and more \nconsistent international aviation security standards and procedures.\n    In addition to these efforts, the Department has been in close \ncontact with Congress, our international partners, the aviation \nindustry and State and local officials across the country since the \nafternoon of the attempted attack. On December 25, the Department \nissued a joint bulletin with the FBI to State and local law enforcement \nthroughout the Nation; conducted calls with major airlines and the Air \nTransport Association; distributed the FBI-DHS joint bulletin to all \nHomeland Security Advisors, regional fusion center directors and Major \nCity Homeland Security Points of Contact in the country; and notified \nforeign air carriers with flights to and from the United States of the \nadditional security requirements. DHS has maintained close contact with \nall of these partners since the attempted attack, and will continue to \ndo so.\n    On January 3, TSA issued a new Security Directive, effective on \nJanuary 4, mandating enhanced passenger screening.\n               steps forward to improve aviation security\n    While these immediate steps helped strengthen our security posture \nto face current threats to our country, as President Obama has made \nclear, we need to take additional actions to address the systemic \nvulnerabilities highlighted by this failed attack. On January 7, \nSecretary Napolitano was joined by Assistant to the President for \nCounterterrorism and Homeland Security John Brennan to announce five \nrecommendations DHS made to the President as a result of the security \nreviews ordered by President Obama. At the President's direction, DHS \nwill pursue these five objectives to enhance the protection of air \ntravel from acts of terrorism.\n    First, DHS will work with our interagency partners to re-evaluate \nand modify the criteria and process used to create terrorist watch \nlist, including adjusting the process by which names are added to the \nNo-Fly and Selectee Lists. The Department's ability to prevent \nterrorists from boarding flights to the United States depends upon \nthese lists and the criteria used to create them. As an entity that is \nprimarily a consumer of this intelligence and the operator of programs \nthat rely on these lists, the Department will work closely with our \npartners in the intelligence community to make clear the kind of \ninformation DHS needs from the watch list system.\n    Second, DHS will establish a partnership on aviation security with \nthe Department of Energy and its National Laboratories in order to use \ntheir expertise to bolster our security. This new partnership will work \nto develop new and more effective technologies that deter and disrupt \nknown threats, as well as anticipate and protect against new ways that \nterrorists could seek to board an aircraft with dangerous materials.\n    Third, DHS will accelerate deployment of Advanced Imaging \nTechnology to provide capabilities to identify materials such as those \nused in the attempted December 25 attack, and we will encourage foreign \naviation security authorities to do the same. TSA currently has 40 \nmachines deployed at nineteen airports throughout the United States, \nand plans to deploy at least 450 additional units in 2010. DHS will \nalso seek to increase our assets in the area of explosives-trained \ncanines, explosives detection equipment, and other security personnel.\n    Fourth, DHS will strengthen the presence and capacity of aviation \nlaw enforcement. As an interim measure, we will deploy law enforcement \nofficers from across DHS to serve as Federal Air Marshals to increase \nsecurity aboard U.S.-flag carriers' international flights. At the same \ntime, we will maintain the current tempo of operations to support high-\nrisk domestic flights, as we look to longer-term solutions to enhance \nthe training and workforce of the Federal Air Marshal Service.\n    Fifth, as mentioned earlier, DHS will work with international \npartners to strengthen international security measures and standards \nfor aviation security. Much of our success in ensuring that terrorists \ndo not board flights to the United States is dependent on what happens \nin foreign airports and the commitments of our foreign partners to \nenhance security--not just for Americans, but also for their nationals \ntraveling to this country.\n    In all of these action areas to bolster aviation security, we are \nmoving forward with a dedication to safeguard the privacy and rights of \ntravelers.\n                               conclusion\n    President Obama has made clear that we will be unrelenting in using \nevery element of our National power in our efforts around the world to \ndisrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaeda and other violent extremists.\n    While we address the circumstances behind this specific incident, \nwe must also recognize the evolving threats posed by terrorists, and \ntake action to ensure that our defenses continue to evolve in order to \ndefeat them. We live in a world of ever-changing risks, and we must \nmove as aggressively as possible both to find and fix security flaws \nand anticipate future vulnerabilities in all sectors. President Obama \nhas clearly communicated the urgency of this task, and the American \npeople rightfully expect swift action. DHS and our Federal partners are \nmoving quickly to provide just that.\n    As Secretary Napolitano said last week, there is no 100 percent \nguarantee that we can prevent a terrorist from trying to take down a \nplane or attack us in some other fashion. That is not the nature of the \nworld we live in, nor of the threats that we face. What we can give \nyou, however, is the 100 percent commitment of the Secretary, myself, \nDHS leadership, and the entire DHS enterprise to do everything we can \nto minimize the risk of terrorist attacks.\n    Chairman Thompson, Representative King, and Members of the \ncommittee: Thank you for this opportunity to testify. I am happy to \nanswer any questions you may have."

"","","lute","Jane Holl Lute","    Mr. Kennedy. Thank you, sir. Chairman Thompson, Ranking \nMember King, distinguished Members of the committee, thank you \nfor the opportunity to appear before you today.\n    After the attempted bombing of Flight 253, Secretary \nClinton stated, ``We are all looking hard at what did happen in \norder to improve our procedures, to avoid human errors, \nmistakes, oversights of any kind, and we are going to be \nworking hard with the rest of the administration to improve \nevery aspect of our effort.''\n    This introspective review and the concurrent interagency \nreview are on-going. We appreciate this committee's interest \nand support as we continue this review process, noting in \nparticular the recent committee staff visit to our consular \nfacility in London. We recognize the gravity of the threat we \nface, and we consider ourselves the first line of defense in \nour National security efforts. We acknowledge that processes \nneed to be improved, and here are the steps we have already \ntaken.\n    The State Department misspelled Umar Farouk Abdullah's name \nin our Visas Viper report. As a result, we did not have that \ninformation about his current U.S. visa in that report. To \nprevent that from occurring again, we instituted new procedures \nto ensure comprehensive visa information is included in all our \nVisas Viper reporting. This will highlight the visa application \nand issuance material also available already in the data that \nwe have shared with our National security partners.\n    We are also reevaluating the procedures and criteria used \nto revoke visas. The State Department has broad and flexible \nauthority to revoke visas. Since 2001, we have revoked over \n51,000 visas for a variety of reasons, including over 1,700 \nsuspected links to terror.\n    New watchlisting information coming from the intelligence \nand law enforcement community is continually checked every day \nagainst the database of previously issued visas. We can and do \nrevoke visas and circumstances where an immediate threat is \nrecognized. We can and do revoke visas to the point of people \nseeking to board aircraft, preventing their boarding in \ncoordination with the FBI's National Targeting Center. We \nrevoke visas under these circumstances almost daily. We are \nstandardizing procedures for triggering revocations from the \nfield and are adding revocation recommendations to the Visas \nViper report.\n    At the same time, expeditious coordination with our \nNational security partners is not to be underestimated. There \nhave been numerous cases where a State Department unilateral \nand uncoordinated revocation would have disrupted important \ninvestigations that were under way by one of our National \nsecurity partners.\n    The individual involved was under active investigation, and \nour revocation action would have disclosed the United States \nGovernment's interest in that individual and ended our National \nsecurity colleague's ability to pursue the case and identify \nterrorist plans and co-conspirators.\n    We will continue to closely coordinate visa revocation \nprocesses with our intelligence and law enforcement partners, \nwhile also constantly making enhancements to the security and \nintegrity of the visa process. Information sharing and \ncoordinated action are foundations of the border security \nsystems put in place since 9/11, and they remain sound \nprinciples.\n    The State Department has close and productive relationships \nwith our interagency partners, particularly with the Department \nof Homeland Security, which has statutory authority for visa \npolicy. The State Department brings unique assets and \ncapabilities to this partnership. Our global presence, \ninternational expertise, and highly trained personnel provide \nus singular advantages in supporting the visa function \nthroughout the world.\n    We developed and implemented intensive screening processes \nrequiring personal interviews and supported by a sophisticated \nglobal information network. This front line of border security \nhas visa offices in virtually every country of the world and \nare staffed by highly trained, multilingual, culturally aware \npersonnel of the State Department.\n    We support them with the latest technology and access to \nenhanced screening tools and information systems. We are \nintroducing a new generation of visa software to more \nefficiently manage our growing mission and the increasing \namounts of data we handle. We are pioneers in the use of \nbiometrics, a leader in the field of facial recognition, and we \nare expanding into the field of iris screening. We have and \nwill continue to automate processes to reduce the possibility \nof human error.\n    The State Department makes all visa information available \nto other agencies, giving them immediate access to over 13 \nyears of data. We introduced on-line visa applications in 2009, \nwhich expanded our data collection tenfold and provide new \ninformation readily available for analysis by the State \nDepartment and by other agencies. This system is being rolled \nout worldwide in a few months.\n    We embrace a layered approach to border security screening, \nwhich results in multiple agencies having an opportunity to \nreview information and requires separate reviews at both the \nvisa application and admission stage. No visa--no visa--is \nissued without it being run through security checks against our \npartners' databases. We screen applicants' fingerprints against \nU.S. databases, and we run our facial recognition software \nagainst the photo array provided by the intelligence community.\n    At the same time we believe that U.S. interests in \nlegitimate trade, travel, and educational exchanges are not in \nopposition to border security. In fact, the United States must \nstrive to meet both goals to guarantee our long-term security.\n    Again, the multi-agency team effort to which each agency \nbrings its particular strengths and expertise results in a \nrobust and secure process, a process based on broadly shared \ninformation. We remain fully committed to correcting mistakes \nand remedying deficiencies that inhibit the full and timely \nsharing of information.\n    We fully recognize that we are not perfect in our reporting \nin connection with this case. However, we are working and will \ncontinue to work not only to address shortcomings, but to \ncontinually enhance our border security screening capabilities \nand the contributions we make to this interagency effort.\n    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to your \nquestions."

"kennedy","Patrick F. Kennedy","lute","Jane Holl Lute","                            January 27, 2010\n    Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member King and distinguished Members of \nthe committee, thank you for the opportunity to address you today. As a \nresult of the attempted terrorist attack on Flight 253, the President \nordered corrective steps to address systemic failures in procedures we \nuse to protect the people of the United States. Secretary Clinton \nreiterated this direction when she stated, ``we all are looking hard at \nwhat did happen in order to improve our procedures to avoid human \nerrors, mistakes, oversights of any kind. We in the State Department \nare fully committed to accepting our responsibility for the mistakes \nthat were made, and we're going to be working hard with the rest of the \nAdministration to improve every aspect of our efforts.'' Therefore, the \nDepartment of State now is working on reviewing visa issuance and \nrevocation criteria and determining how technological enhancements can \nfacilitate and strengthen visa-related business processes.\n    Our immediate attention is on addressing the deficiencies \nidentified following the attempted attack on Flight 253. At the same \ntime we continue to plan for the future, incorporating new technology, \nincreasing data sharing and enhancing operational cooperation with \npartner agencies. We have a record of quickly adapting and improving \nour procedures to respond to security imperatives. We have a highly \ntrained global team working daily to protect our borders and fulfill \nthe overseas border security mission and other critical tasks ranging \nfrom crisis management to protection of American interests abroad. \nWithin the Department we have a dynamic partnership between the Bureau \nof Consular Affairs and the Bureau of Diplomatic Security that adds a \nvaluable law enforcement and investigative component to our \ncapabilities. We will use these strengths to address the continuing \nsecurity threats.\n    In the case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, on the day following his \nfather's November 19 visit to the Embassy, we sent a cable to the \nWashington intelligence and law enforcement community through proper \nchannels (the Visas Viper system) that ``Information at post suggests \ntime, the Consular Section entered Abdulmutallab into the Consular \nLookout and Support System database known as CLASS. In sending the \nVisas Viper cable and checking State Department records to determine \nwhether Abdulmutallab had a visa, Embassy officials misspelled his \nname, but entered it correctly into CLASS. As a result of the \nmisspelling in the cable, information about previous visas issued to \nhim and the fact that he currently held a valid U.S. visa was not \nincluded in the cable. At the same time the CLASS entry resulted in a \nlookout using the correct spelling that was shared automatically with \nthe primary lookout system used by the Department of Homeland Security \n(DHS) and accessible to other agencies.\n    We have taken immediate action to improve the procedures and \ncontent requirements for Visas Viper cable reporting that will call \nattention to the visa application and issuance material that is already \nin the data that we share with our National security partners. All \nofficers have been instructed to include complete information about all \nprevious and current U.S. visa(s). This guidance includes specific \nmethods to comprehensively and intensively search the database of visa \nrecords so that all pertinent information is obtained.\n    In addition to this change in current procedures to search visa \nrecords, we immediately began working to refine the capability of our \ncurrent systems. When dealing with applications for visas, we employ \nstrong, sophisticated name searching algorithms to ensure matches \nbetween names of visa applicants and any derogatory information \ncontained in the 27 million records found in CLASS. This strong \nsearching capability has been central to our procedures since automated \nlookout system checks were mandated following the 1993 World Trade \nCenter bombing. We will use our significant experience with search \nmechanisms for derogatory information to improve the systems for \nchecking our visa issuance records.\n    The Department of State has been matching new threat information \nwith our records of existing visas since 2002. We have long recognized \nthis function as critical to the way we manage our records and \nprocesses. This system of continual vetting has evolved as post-9/11 \nreforms were instituted and is now performed by the Terrorist Screening \nCenter (TSC). All records added to the Terrorist Screening Database are \nchecked against the Department's Consolidated Consular Database (CCD) \nto determine if there are matching visa records. Matches are sent \nelectronically from the TSC to the Department of State to flag cases \nfor visa revocation. In almost all such cases, visas are revoked. In \naddition, we have widely disseminated our data to other agencies that \nmay wish to learn whether a subject of interest has a U.S. visa. Cases \nfor revocation consideration are forwarded to us by DHS/Customs and \nBorder Protection's (CBP) National Targeting Center (NTC) and other \nentities. Almost every day, we receive requests to review and, if \nwarranted, revoke visas for potential travelers for whom new derogatory \ninformation has been discovered since the visa was issued. Our \nOperations Center is staffed 24 hours per day/7 days per week to work \nthese issues. Many of these requests are urgent because the person is \nabout to board a plane. The State Department then uses its authority to \nprudentially revoke the visa.\n    Since the Presidentially-ordered Security Review, there have been \nchanges in the thresholds for adding individuals to the Terrorist \nScreening Database, No-Fly, and Selectee lists. The number of \nrevocations has increased substantially as a result. This revocation \nwork is processed electronically in the Department. As soon as \ninformation is established to support a revocation, an entry showing \nthe visa revocation is added electronically to the Department of \nState's lookout system and shared in real time with the DHS lookout \nsystems used for border screening.\n    In addition to these changes, the Department is reviewing the \nprocedures and criteria used in the field to revoke visas and will \nissue new instructions to our officers. Revocation recommendations will \nbe added as an element of reporting through the Visas Viper channel. We \nwill be reiterating our guidance on use of the broad discretionary \nauthority of visa officers to deny visas on security and other grounds. \nInstruction in appropriate use of this authority has been a fundamental \npart of officer training for several years.\n    The State Department has broad and flexible authority to revoke \nvisas and we use that authority widely to protect our borders. Since \n2001, we have revoked 51,000 visas for a variety of reasons, including \nover 1,700 for suspected links to terrorism. We have been actively \nusing this authority as we perform internal scrubs of our data with \nwatch list information provided by partner agencies. For example, we \nare re-examining information in our CLASS database on individuals with \npotential connections to terrorist activity or support for such \nactivity. We are reviewing all previous Visas Viper submissions as well \nas cases that other agencies are bringing to our attention from the No-\nFly and Selectee lists, as well as other sources. In these reviews, we \nhave identified cases for revocation and we have also confirmed that \nsubstantial numbers of individuals in these classes hold no visas and \nof those few who did, many were revoked prior to the current review. We \nrecognize the gravity of the threat we face and are working intensely \nwith our colleagues from other agencies to ensure that when the U.S. \nGovernment obtains information that a person may pose a threat to our \nsecurity, that person does not hold a visa.\n    We will use revocation authority prior to interagency consultation \nin circumstances where we believe there is an immediate threat. \nRevocation is an important tool in our border security arsenal. At the \nsame time, expeditious coordination with our National security partners \nis not to be underestimated. There have been numerous cases where our \nunilateral and uncoordinated revocation would have disrupted important \ninvestigations that were underway by one of our National security \npartners. They had the individual under investigation and our \nrevocation action would have disclosed the U.S. Government's interest \nin the individual and ended our colleagues' ability to quietly pursue \nthe case and identify terrorists' plans and co-conspirators.\n    In addition to revocation efforts, consular officers refused \n1,885,017 visas in fiscal year 2009. We now are renewing guidance to \nour officers on their discretionary authority to refuse visas under \nsection 214(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act with specific \nreference to cases that raise security concerns. No visa is issued \nwithout it being run through security checks against our partners' \ndata. And we screen applicants' fingerprints against U.S. databases as \nwell.\n    The Department has a close and productive partnership with DHS, \nwhich has authority for visa policy. Over the past 7 years both \nagencies significantly increased resources, improved procedures, and \nupgraded systems devoted to supporting the visa function. DHS receives \nall of the information collected by the Department of State during the \nvisa process. DHS has broad access to our entire CCD, containing 136 \nmillion records related to both immigrant and nonimmigrant visas and \ncovering visa actions of the last 13 years. Special extracts of data \nare supplied to elements within DHS, including the Visa Security Units \nof Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). These extracts have been \ntailored to the specific requirements of those units. We are working \nclosely with ICE Visa Security Units established abroad and with \ndomestic elements of DHS, such as CBP's National Targeting Center.\n    We gave DHS access to U.S. passport records, used by CBP to confirm \nthe identity of citizens returning to the United States. We developed \nnew card-type travel documents that work with the automated systems CBP \ninstalled at the U.S. land borders. We are collecting more information \nelectronically and earlier in the process. Expanded data collection \ndone in advance of travel will give DHS and partner agencies richer \ninformation and more time for analysis.\n    We make all of our visa information available to other involved \nagencies, and we specifically designed our systems to facilitate \ncomprehensive data sharing. We give other agencies immediate access to \nover 13 years of visa data, and they use this access extensively. In \nNovember 2009, more than 16,000 employees of DHS, the Department of \nDefense (DOD), the FBI and Commerce made 920,000 queries on visa \nrecords. We embrace a layered approach to border security screening and \nare fully supportive of the DHS Visa Security Program.\n    The Department of State is at the forefront of interagency \ncooperation and data sharing to improve border security, and we \nembarked on initiatives that will position us to meet future challenges \nwhile taking into consideration our partner agencies and their specific \nneeds and requirements. We are implementing a new generation of visa \nprocessing systems that will further integrate information gathered \nfrom domestic and overseas activities. We are restructuring our \ninformation technology architecture to accommodate the unprecedented \nscale of information we collect and to keep us agile and adaptable in \nan age of intensive and growing requirements for data and data sharing.\n    We proactively expanded biometric screening programs and spared no \neffort to integrate this expansion into existing overseas facilities. \nIn partnership with DHS and the FBI, we established the largest \nbiometric screening process on the globe. We were a pioneer in the use \nof facial recognition techniques and remain a leader in operational use \nof this technology. In 2009 we expanded use of facial recognition from \na selected segment of visa applications to all visa applications. We \nnow are expanding our use of this technology beyond visa records. We \nare testing use of iris recognition technology in visa screening, \nmaking use of both identity and derogatory information collected by \nDOD. These efforts require intense on-going cooperation from other \nagencies. We successfully forged and continue to foster partnerships \nthat recognize the need to supply accurate and speedy screening in a \n24/7 global environment. As we implement process and policy changes, we \nare always striving to add value in both border security and in \noperational results. Both dimensions are important in supporting the \nvisa process.\n    The Department of State is an integral player on the border \nsecurity team. We are the first line of defense. Our global presence, \nforeign policy mission, and personnel structure give us singular \nadvantages in executing the visa function throughout the world. Our \nauthorities and responsibilities enable us to provide a global \nperspective to the visa process and its impact on U.S. National \ninterests. The issuance and refusal of visas has a direct impact on \nforeign relations. Visa policy quickly can become a significant \nbilateral problem that harms U.S. interests if handled without \nconsideration of foreign policy impacts. The conduct of U.S. visa \npolicy has a direct and significant impact on the treatment of U.S. \ncitizens abroad. The Department of State is in a position to anticipate \nand weigh those possibilities.\n    We developed and implemented intensive screening processes \nrequiring personal interviews, employing analytic interview techniques, \nincorporating multiple biometric checks, all built around a \nsophisticated global information technology network. This frontline of \nborder security has visa offices present in virtually every country of \nthe world. They are staffed by highly trained and multi-lingual \npersonnel of the Department of State. These officials are dedicated to \na career of worldwide service and provide the cultural awareness, \nknowledge, and objectivity to ensure that the visa function remains the \nfrontline of border security.\n    In addition, we have 145 officers and 540 locally employed staff \ndevoted specifically to fraud prevention and document security, \nincluding fraud prevention officers at overseas posts. We have a large \nFraud Prevention Programs office in Washington, DC that works very \nclosely with the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, and we have fraud \nscreening operations using sophisticated database checks at both the \nKentucky Consular Center and the National Visa Center in Portsmouth, \nNew Hampshire. Their role in flagging applications and applicants who \nlack credibility, who present fraudulent documents, or who give us \nfalse information adds a valuable dimension to our visa process.\n    The Bureau of Diplomatic Security adds an important law enforcement \nelement to the Department's visa procedures. There are now 50 Assistant \nRegional Security Officer Investigators abroad specifically devoted to \nmaintaining the integrity of the process. They are complemented by \nofficers working domestically on both visa and passport matters. These \nDiplomatic Security officers staff a unit within the Bureau of Consular \nAffairs that monitors overseas visa activities to detect risks and \nvulnerabilities. These highly trained law enforcement professionals add \nanother dimension to our border security efforts.\n    The multi-agency team effort on border security, based upon broadly \nshared information, provides a solid foundation. At the same time we \nremain fully committed to correcting mistakes and remedying \ndeficiencies that inhibit the full and timely sharing of information. \nWe have and we will continue to automate processes to reduce the \npossibility of human error. We fully recognize that we were not perfect \nin our reporting in connection with the attempted terrorist attack on \nFlight 253. We are working and will continue to work not only to \naddress that mistake but to continually enhance our border security \nscreening capabilities and the contributions we make to the interagency \neffort.\n    We believe that U.S. interests in legitimate travel, trade \npromotion, and educational exchange are not in conflict with our border \nsecurity agenda and, in fact, further that agenda in the long term. Our \nlong-term interests are served by continuing the flow of commerce and \nideas that are the foundations of prosperity and security. Acquainting \npeople with American culture and perspectives remains the surest way to \nreduce misperceptions about the United States. Fostering academic and \nprofessional exchange keeps our universities and research institutions \nat the forefront of scientific and technological change. We believe the \nUnited States must meet both goals to guarantee our long-term security.\n    We are facing an evolving threat. The tools we use to address this \nthreat must be sophisticated and agile. Information obtained from these \ntools must be comprehensive and accurate. Our criteria for taking \naction must be clear and coordinated. The team we use for this mission \nmust be the best. The Department of State has spent years developing \nthe tools and personnel needed to properly execute the visa function \noverseas and remains fully committed to continuing to fulfill its \nessential role on the border security team."

"","","kennedy","Patrick F. Kennedy","    Mr. Leiter. Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member King, Members \nof the committee, thank you for holding this hearing on the \nevents of Christmas day.\n    Let me start with the most crystal-clear assertion I can \nmake. Omar Farouk Abdulmutallab should not have boarded that \nplane bound for the United States on Christmas day. The \ncounterterrorism system failed, and I along with other leaders \nhave told the President--I tell you, I am telling the American \npeople--we are determined to do better.\n    I have also pledged to the President, along with the DNI, a \nfresh and penetrating look at the human and technical factors \nthat we think contributed to this failure and try to determine \nways that we can improve our performance. The President has \ntasked me with two specific responsibilities--one, a \nmethodology of pursuing follow-up actions for all threats and \nthreads as we detect them, and second, a dedicated capability \nat NCTC to enhance watch list records.\n    In addition, I am, of course, working with the DNI, with \nLeon Panetta, with Bob Mueller and other members of the IC to \nwork on intelligence community-specific improvements.\n    I would like to briefly summarize the events of Christmas \nday from our perspective and what went wrong. I want to start \nby debunking something that has become conventional wisdom, \nthat this is a failure just like 9/11. As the President has \nsaid, this was not, like 2001, a failure to collect or share \nintelligence. Rather, it was a failure to connect, integrate, \nand understand the intelligence.\n    Now, one is not necessarily a lead to the more tragic \nconsequences than the other, but the differences in those \nfailures obviously lead to a different set of reforms that \nmight be necessary.\n    Although the National Counterterrorism Center and the \nintelligence community have long warned, going back to 2008, \n2009, about the threat posed by al-Qaeda in Yemen, we did not \ncorrelate the specific information that would have kept \nAbdulmutallab off that flight.\n    We did highlight the growing threat of al-Qaeda in Yemen. \nWe also focused on targets in Yemen, but in the fall of 2009 we \nincreased the need to talk about the possibility of al-Qaeda \nfrom Yemen targeting the United States. We also in fact \nanalyzed the information that al-Qaeda was working with an \nindividual who, only again after the fact, did we know to be \nAbdulmutallab.\n    Finally, the intelligence community also warned repeatedly \nof the type of explosive device that was ultimately used by \nAbdulmutallab and the ways in which that device could be used \nto undermine U.S. aviation screening. But again, despite having \nidentified these overall streams, we failed to make the last \nfinal connection, what I would refer to as the last tactical \nmile here, linking Abdulmutallab's identity to the plot that \nwas in train.\n    We indeed had the information that came from his father \nthat he was concerned about his son going to Yemen, coming \nunder the influence of religious extremists, and that he was \nnot going to return home. We also had streams of information \nfrom other intelligence channels that provide the pieces of the \nstory. We had a partial name, an indicator of a Nigerian, but \nthere was no single piece of intelligence that brought that \ntogether, nor did we at NCTC or elsewhere in the intelligence \ncommunity do that in our analysis.\n    As a result, although Mr. Abdulmutallab was identified with \nrespect to terrorists and placed in the Terrorist Identities \nDatamart Environment, he was not watchlisted based on the \ninformation that was associated with him, nor was the placed on \nthe No-Fly or Selectee list.\n    Had all the information the United States had available at \nthe time that link together, his name would have been \nwatchlisted and thus on the visa screening list and the border \ninspection list. Whether he would have been placed on the No-\nFly and Selectee list, based on the existing standards, would \nhave been determined by the strength of our analytic judgment. \nAs I have already said, I believe, one of the clear lessons we \nhave learned is a need to re-examine the standards for \ninclusion on these various watch lists.\n    Finally, and I hope I have made clear I have no desire to \ntry to make excuses for what we did not do, because there are \nthings that we didn't do well and we didn't do right. I do want \nto give you at least a bit of context about the context in \nwhich this failure occurred.\n    Every day the National Counterterrorism Center receives \nliterally thousands of pieces of intelligence related to CT--\nmore than 5,000 a day; well over 5,000. We review well over \n5,000 names each day. Each day more than 350 individuals are \nactually placed on the watch list.\n    Now, in hindsight we can say with a high degree of \nconfidence that Abdulmutallab was plotting with AQAP. Although \nwe obviously have to do better, we have to recognize that in my \nview there is no single silver bullet, and that is especially \ntrue as this terror threat we face becomes more multi-\ndimensional and more dispersed away from traditional areas of \npromoting terrorism.\n    So while watchlisting and intelligence are critical tools \nin this fight, I would echo the Chairman's statement of the \nneed for a layered approach to counterterrorism, which includes \ntechnology, international screening and cooperation and the \nlike.\n    Now, very quickly, I would like to outline the ways in \nwhich we are improving the system already. As I have noted, the \nPresident has assigned to the interagency to review the \nstandards for inclusion on the watch lists, including the No-\nFly Selectee list. This has been done.\n    In addition, we have immediately moved additional resources \nto focusing on Yemen and other al-Qaeda affiliates that we \nbelieve pose a threat to U.S. homeland security.\n    Third, we are trying to move away from a names-based system \nof pursuing these threats, ensuring that our analysts have the \ntime and resources to pursue the small tidbits of information \nso they can in fact associate that with individuals and ensure \nproper watchlisting.\n    Finally, as I also noted at the outset, under the \nPresident's direction we are expanding and deepening our \nallocation of responsibility for specific follow-up actions for \na wide range of threats, not just those that appear to be high-\npriority threats in the beginning.\n    With that, Mr. Chairman, I very much look forward to \nworking with this committee and fielding your questions as we \nwork on this together."

"leiter","Michael E. Leiter","kennedy","Patrick F. Kennedy","                            27 January 2010\n    Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member King, and Members of the \nCommittee on Homeland Security: Thank you for your invitation to appear \nbefore the committee to discuss the events leading up to the attempted \nterrorist attack on Christmas day and the improvements the National \nCounterterrorism Center and the intelligence community have underway to \nfix deficiencies.\n    It is my privilege to be accompanied by Jane Holl Lute, Deputy \nSecretary of Homeland Security and Patrick Kennedy, Under Secretary of \nState for Management.\n    The attempted terrorist attack on Christmas day did not succeed, \nbut, as one of several recent attacks against the United States \ninspired by jihadist ideology or directed by al-Qaeda and its \naffiliates, it reminds us that our mission to protect Americans is \nunending.\n    Let's start with this clear assertion: Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab \nshould not have stepped on that plane. The counterterrorism system \nfailed and we told the President we are determined to do better.\n    Within the intelligence community we had strategic intelligence \nthat al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) had the intention of \ntaking action against the United States prior to the failed attack on \nDecember 25, but, we did not direct more resources against AQAP, nor \ninsist that the watchlisting criteria be adjusted prior to the event. \nIn addition, the intelligence community analysts who were working hard \non immediate threats to Americans in Yemen did not understand the \nfragments of intelligence on what turned out later to be Mr. \nAbdulmutallab, so they did not push him onto the terrorist watch list.\n    We are taking a fresh and penetrating look at strengthening both \nhuman and technical performance and do what we have to do in all areas. \nDirector of National Intelligence Blair and I have specifically been \ntasked by the President to improve and manage work in four areas:\n  <bullet> Immediately reaffirm and clarify roles and responsibilities \n        of the counterterrorism analytic components of the IC in \n        synchronizing, correlating, and analyzing all sources of \n        intelligence related to terrorism.\n  <bullet> Accelerate information technology enhancements, to include \n        knowledge discovery, database integration, cross-database \n        searches, and the ability to correlate biographic information \n        with terrorism-related intelligence.\n  <bullet> Take further steps to enhance the rigor and raise the \n        standard of tradecraft of intelligence analysis, especially \n        analysis designed to uncover and prevent terrorist plots.\n  <bullet> Ensure resources are properly aligned with issues \n        highlighted in strategic warning analysis.\n    Additionally, NCTC has been tasked by the President to do the \nfollowing:\n  <bullet> Establish and resource appropriately a process to prioritize \n        and to pursue thoroughly and exhaustively terrorism threat \n        threads, to include the identification of appropriate follow-up \n        action by the intelligence, law enforcement, and homeland \n        security communities.\n  <bullet> Establish a dedicated capability responsible for enhancing \n        record information on possible terrorist in the Terrorist \n        Identities Datamart Environment for watchlisting purposes.\n           the events leading up to the christmas day attack\n    I will now briefly discuss some of the details of the bombing \nattempt and what we missed. As the President has said, this was not--\nlike in 2001--a failure to collect or share intelligence; rather it was \na failure to connect, integrate, and understand the intelligence we \nhad.\n    Although NCTC and the intelligence community had long warned of the \nthreat posed by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, we did not correlate \nthe specific information that would have been required to help keep \nAbdulmutallab off that Northwest Airlines flight.\n    More specifically, the intelligence community highlighted the \ngrowing threat to U.S. and Western interests in the region posed by \nAQAP, whose precursor elements attacked our embassy in Sana'a in 2008. \nOur analysis focused on AQAP's plans to strike U.S. targets in Yemen, \nbut it also noted--increasingly in the fall of 2009--the possibility of \ntargeting the United States. We had analyzed the information that this \ngroup was working with an individual who we now know was the individual \ninvolved in the Christmas attack.\n    In addition, the intelligence community warned repeatedly of the \ntype of explosive device used by Abdulmutallab and the ways in which it \nmight prove a challenge to screening. Of course, at the Amsterdam \nairport, Abdulmutallab was subjected to the same screening as other \npassengers--he passed through a metal detector, which didn't detect the \nexplosives that were sewn into his clothes.\n    As I have noted, despite our successes in identifying the overall \nthemes that described the plot we failed to make the final \nconnections--the ``last tactical mile''--linking Abdulmutallab's \nidentity to the plot. We had the information that came from his father \nthat he was concerned about his son going to Yemen, coming under the \ninfluence of unknown religious extremists, and that he was not going to \nreturn home. We also had other streams of information coming from \nintelligence channels that provided pieces of the story. We had a \npartial name, an indication of a Nigerian, but there was nothing that \nbrought it all together--nor did we do so in our analysis.\n    As a result, although Mr. Abdulmutallab was identified as a known \nor suspected terrorist and entered into the Terrorist Identities \nDatamart Environment (TIDE)--and this information was in turn widely \navailable throughout the intelligence community--the derogatory \ninformation associated with him did not meet the existing policy \nstandards--those first adopted in the summer of 2008 and ultimately \npromulgated in February 2009--for him to be ``watchlisted,'' let alone \nplaced on the No-Fly List or Selectee lists.\n    Had all of the information the United States had available, \nfragmentary and otherwise, been linked together, his name would have \nundoubtedly been entered on the Terrorist Screening Database which is \nexported to the Department of State and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. Whether he would have been placed on either the No-Fly or \nSelectee list--again based on the existing standards--would have been \ndetermined by the strength of the analytic judgment. One of the clear \nlessons the U.S. Government has learned and which the intelligence \ncommunity will support is the need to modify the standards for \ninclusion on such lists.\n    In hindsight, the intelligence we had can be assessed with a high \ndegree of confidence to describe Mr. Abdulmutallab as a likely \noperative of AQAP. But without making excuses for what we did not do, I \nthink it critical that we at least note the context in which this \nfailure occurred: Each day NCTC receives literally thousands of pieces \nof intelligence information from around the world, reviews literally \nthousands of different names, and places more than 350 people a day on \nthe watch list--virtually all based on far more damning information \nthan that associated with Mr. Abdulutallab prior to Christmas day. \nAlthough we must and will do better, we must also recognize that not \nall of the pieces rise above the noise level.\n    The men and women of the National Counterterrorism Center and the \nintelligence community are committed to fighting terrorism at home and \nabroad and will seek every opportunity to better our analytical \ntradecraft, more aggressively pursue those that plan and perpetrate \nacts of terrorism, and effectively enhance the criteria used to keep \nknown or suspected terrorists out of the United States."

"","","leiter","Michael E. Leiter","    Chairman Thompson. Thank you very much.\n    I thank all the witnesses for their testimony.\n    I remind each Member that he or she will have 5 minutes to \nquestion the panel. I will now recognize myself for questions.\n    To each one of the panelists, since this occurrence on \nDecember 25, has any personnel action or disciplinary action \ntaken place in your Department relative to this incident?\n    Ms. Lute. In the Department of Homeland Security, Mr. \nChairman, the personnel actions that have been taken have \nrelated to intensified training, intensified deployment, but \nthere have been no disciplinary actions that have taken place.\n    Chairman Thompson. So there are no disciplinary----\n    Mr. Kennedy. No disciplinary actions, sir.\n    Mr. Leiter. We are currently reviewing all the personnel. \nWe have made no final decisions.\n    Chairman Thompson. If you will, at whatever point you \ncomplete that review, would you provide the committee that \nwhich the law allows so we can review it?\n    Mr. Leiter. Absolutely, Mr. Chairman.\n    Chairman Thompson. So my understanding is, even though this \nwas an unfortunate situation, nobody has been disciplined. We \nunderstand the President took responsibility, and that is good, \nbut the question in the minds of a lot of us is, is that good \nenough?\n    Now, my next question to each one of you is if that \nsituation occurred today, would it be any different?\n    Mr. Kennedy. On the State Department, it would be \ndifferent, Mr. Chairman. We had a process that had been worked \nout with the interagency community, and we have discovered that \nwe did not have sufficient checkmarks in. There was no \nrequirement in our previous rule grid when we reported on the \nVisas Viper, meaning somebody coming into an American embassy \nand saying we have concerns about a third party.\n    We reported that immediately, but we did not have in that \nprocess a checkmark that this individual had a U.S. visa. I \ncannot tell you why that wasn't included. I can tell you \nprobably because we had already passed to the law enforcement \nintelligence community the list of everyone who gets a visa on \na daily basis.\n    We have now added that to our process, so any person who \ncomes in the embassy and makes a report of terrorist concern, \nnot only to report that individual in our Visas Viper message \nto the community, but we add then this person has a United \nStates visa, and we have also enhanced the name-checking \ncapability in that system to make sure that if there is a \nmisspelling----\n    Chairman Thompson. Okay. So, all right, so he has a visa. \nSo what does that do?\n    Mr. Kennedy. What?\n    Chairman Thompson. In the process. Does it revoke the visa? \nDoes it----\n    Mr. Kennedy. As I mentioned in my statement, Mr. Chairman, \nif we unilaterally revoked a visa, and there was the case \nrecently up, we have a request from a law enforcement agency to \nnot revoke the visa. We came across information. We said, \n``This is a dangerous person.'' We were ready to revoke the \nvisa. We then went to the community and said, ``Should we \nrevoke this visa?''\n    One of the members--and we would be glad to give you that \nin private--said, ``Please, do not revoke this visa. We have \neyes on this person. We are following this person who has the \nvisa for the purpose of trying to roll up an entire network, \nnot just stop one person.''\n    So we will revoke the visa of any individual who is a \nthreat to the United States, but we do take one preliminary \nstep. We ask our law enforcement and intelligence community \npartners, ``Do you have eyes on this person and do you want us \nto let this person proceed under your surveillance so that you \nmay potentially break a larger plot?''\n    Chairman Thompson. I think that the point that I am trying \nto get at is is this just another box you are checking, or is \nthere some security value to adding that box to the list?\n    Mr. Kennedy. Yes. The intelligence and law enforcement \ncommunity tell us that they believe in certain cases that there \nis a higher value of them following this person so they can \nfind his or her co-conspirators and roll up an entire plot \nagainst the United States, rather than simply knock out one \nsoldier in that effort.\n    Chairman Thompson. Mr. Leiter.\n    Mr. Leiter. I would offer four ways in which I think the \nprocess would work differently today, Mr. Chairman. First, \nactually beginning in July 2008, right after Mr. Abdulmutallab \nobtained his visa, NCTC began working with State Department in \nreviewing visa applications in a new and more advanced way.\n    The way in which we now review that visa, and I can't go \ninto it in the open session, would have detected a connection \nwith Mr. Abdulmutallab, which would have stamped an automatic \nwarning to State Department, DHS, FBI and other intelligence \ncommunity components. So first of all, he might not have even \ngotten the visa in the first place.\n    Second, anyone who has a visa that goes on the watch list, \nthe default is if that visa is revoked, they also become a no-\nfly to ensure that if someone shows up with the visa, if there \nis some confusion there, they are also a no-fly. That is the \nsecond step.\n    Third, we have dedicated teams that don't have any \nresponsibility for producing intelligence, but simply for \nfollowing up on these small leads. I believe those teams would \nincrease the likelihood we would tap.\n    Fourth, we have, as an interagency way, reviewed already \nthe standards for placement on No-Fly. Although those standards \nhave not yet been formally adjusted, they are being interpreted \nin a manner which allows us to more broadly apply those \npractically.\n    Chairman Thompson. Thank you.\n    I yield to the Ranking Member for questions.\n    Mr. King. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    I guess this would go to Mr. Leiter and Deputy Secretary \nLute. The President first spoke to the Nation on this on \nMonday, December 28, I believe. It was 3 days after the event. \nDuring that time I assume most of this information was \navailable to the intelligence community, whoever was briefing \nthe President. Yet when he spoke that day, 3 days after, he \nreferred to Abdulmutallab as an isolated extremist.\n    Do you know who was responsible for clearing that \nstatement, when obviously he was not an isolated extremist? He \nwas part of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. We had this \nseries of information on him. Now, the President seemed to \ncorrect that the next day. Why did the President go forward and \nuse that term? Who is responsible for briefing him? Who is \nresponsible for clearing that statement?\n    Mr. Leiter. Congressman, I frankly can't speak to the White \nHouse interactions and who prepared that for the President and \nwho briefed him on that. I simply don't know. I would say that \non the night, on Christmas night, we advised the White House. I \nthink the White House, we said that we believe this was an \nattempted terrorist attack.\n    I will also add that during this entire look back, an on-\ngoing investigation, as you know, different pieces of \ninformation have come forward, which have made it more and more \nclear, I think, each day of his connections to al-Qaeda in the \nArabian Peninsula.\n    Mr. King. Secretary Lute.\n    Ms. Lute. Congressman, I would echo what Director Leiter \nhas said. I was equally not involved in the deliberations \nwithin the White House to inform the President.\n    I can also say, as Director Leiter has said, that from the \nmoment we became aware of this incident, there was an extremely \nintensive effort to identify as many facts about this \nindividual as we possibly could, including reaching out to \ninternational partners who held some elements of information. \nThat work was intensive over those several----\n    Mr. King. Because this interrupts my time, I want to \ninterrupt. Again, I am just concerned why 3 days later, with \nall this information available, the President said ``isolated \nextremist.'' Was it John Brennan who briefed him? Was it Leon \nPanetta?\n    I mean it would seem to me that in a situation like this, \nthere should be one point person, who goes in and tells the \nPresident, who coordinates everything. Who is that coordinator? \nDo you know? Who would have allowed him to say ``isolated \nextremist'' when he was not isolated?\n    Mr. Leiter. Congressman, I know that the National \nCounterterrorism Center and others were providing intelligence \nto the White House on an on-going basis. I simply don't know \nhow those statements were produced.\n    Mr. King. Okay.\n    Secretary Lute and Mr. Leiter, would, you know, either \nyourselves or anyone in the intelligence community who would \nnow say that Abdulmutallab should be un-Mirandized at this \nstage? Because, obviously, Director Blair seems to believe it \nwas a mistake to have him put into the criminal justice system. \nAt this stage, is anyone willing to recommend he be taken out \nof the criminal justice system and put into the military \ntribunal system?\n    Ms. Lute. Congressman, what I can say from the Department \nof Homeland Security's perspective and in hindsight--there is a \nlot of hindsight going on--we are focused on those aspects of \nthis for which the Department had key responsibility. The \ndecisions regarding the Mirandizing of Abdulmutallab are \nappropriately directed to the Justice Department.\n    Mr. King. Okay. My understanding was the Secretary of \nHomeland Security is a member of the President's task force on \ninterrogation, and that supported the creation of the HIG. I am \nwondering does the Department have a position of whether or not \nat this stage, not doing Monday morning quarterbacking, right \nnow as of Wednesday, January 27, do you believe that you should \nbe taken out of the criminal justice system and put into the \nmilitary tribunal system?\n    Ms. Lute. Congressman, I am not party of all of the \nconversations that have gone in this individual. I am not \nprepared----\n    Mr. King. Director Leiter.\n    Mr. Leiter. Congressman, I think it is critically important \nthat we try to get in as much information from him as we can. I \nthink now, several weeks after the arrest and Mirandizing, it \nis not at all clear to me, and I am not close enough to know \nwhether or not it would be productive or counterproductive, \ngiven the current FBI investigation, to do that.\n    Mr. King. Secretary Lute, it has been reported in the press \nthat CBP was waiting in Detroit to question the terrorist when \nhe came off the plane. If that is true, wouldn't that have been \nsufficient information to contact the Netherlands and at least \nask them to do a secondary inspection?\n    Ms. Lute. Congressman, what CBP had was consistent with our \nlong-standing practice of examining issues related to \nadmissibility, and----\n    Mr. King. Okay, but looking at it now--we are going toward \nthe future again--I am not trying to Monday morning \nquarterback, but looking toward the future, having that \ninformation, if there is enough information to question a \nperson coming off, is it that difficult to ask another \ngovernment to give him a secondary inspection?\n    Ms. Lute. We in fact have changed our practice.\n    Mr. King. We have. Okay.\n    Ms. Lute. That kind of information will be pushed forward.\n    Mr. King. Let me ask Director Leiter and Secretary Lute: \nPeople have said the system failed, but what really was the \nsystem failure? Wasn't it judgments that failed? Obviously, we \nalways have to adapt the system. But it seems to me the system \nprovided enough information that, if it were properly \ninterpreted, this would not have happened. Did the system \nactually fail, or are we talking about judgment mistakes?\n    Again, I am not trying to Monday morning quarterback. But I \nthink rather than just say the system failed, one person \naccepts the responsibility, shouldn't we be--as the Chairman \nseemed to be indicating, and I agree--looking for individuals \nwho did make judgment mistakes?\n    Mr. Leiter. Congressman, I think there are potentially some \ninstances where there was a protocol to be followed, and \nsomeone didn't follow the protocol. That is one category of \nfailure.\n    The second category of failing is did you connect these two \npieces of data? I frankly think that that second category is a \nlot harder to identify and clearly say you made a mistake. We \nwant analysts to do that. But whether or not they actually \ncould, and piece that all together, given the resources, the \nworkload they are facing, I think it is much more difficult to \nsay that that was a clear failure.\n    I believe the phrase ``systemic failure'' was meant to \nsuggest that there are a series of failings in different pieces \nof the system, not that the entire system itself is broken.\n    Mr. King. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Chairman Thompson. Thank you very much.\n    The Chair now recognizes the gentlelady from California for \n5 minutes. Ms. Harman.\n    Ms. Harman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    I would like to welcome our witnesses, but comment on the \nabsence of Secretary Napolitano. This is the committee with \nprimary jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security. \nShe is the Secretary of Homeland Security. She is in \nWashington, DC.\n    She was invited to testify at this very important hearing, \nand she should have been here, Deputy Secretary Lute. I \nunderstand that you were prepared and you had accepted our \ninvitation, but I am very personally disappointed that she \nisn't here.\n    I also want to note for the record that I was briefed \nfollowing the Christmas bomb plot within a few days. I was \nfirst in my district, and then I was on a family vacation, but \nSecretary Napolitano did call me after she spoke to the \nChairman. I am quite aware that she had first spoken to him. I \nalso exchanged e-mails and had numerous calls with Mr. Leiter, \nwho was first in Washington, DC, during the event and then \nsubsequently on a short family vacation himself. I know he was \nhard at work.\n    Mr. King. Would you just yield for 2 seconds? Just to say \nnobody on this side received those briefings, which I think is \nwrong. It has always been bipartisan.\n    Ms. Harman. I agree with you, Mr. King, that there should \nbe bipartisan briefings. You know that I agree with that.\n    I also want to note that in recent years there have been \nmany intelligence community successes. The Zazi plot, the \nHeadley plot and others are examples of success, and there had \nbeen many intelligence community sacrifices, particularly the \nloss recently of seven CIA personnel at the Forward Operating \nBase Chapman in Afghanistan. Obviously, all of us know this and \nwant to salute again today the hard-working women and men of \nthe intelligence community.\n    But despite all those successes and the risks that they \ntake, the Christmas day problem does represent a failure. Two \nof you, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Leiter, have stepped up and taken \nresponsibility, as has Mr. Brennan, and I applaud you for doing \nthat. I applaud the fact that you have all pledged that you \nwould do better.\n    Doing better is not optional. A hundred percent security \ncan never be achieved, but surely we can do better. At least to \nme, listening to all of this and based on my long experience \nwith the Intelligence Reform Act and other efforts to try to \nbetter, I think that doing better is not about laundry lists. \nIt is about leadership.\n    Only through leadership will our system of layered security \nbecome more agile and responsive. Let us understand that the \nenemy that is seeking to harm us is agile and responsive. \nWhatever it is that we now decide to do, they will try to \nfigure out a way to get around it. So our system of collection, \nanalysis, visa approval, watchlisting and other things should \nget better. But only through strong leadership will that better \nsystem stay agile and responsive.\n    Let me just add one thing as the tag end. This I commend \nthe Department of Homeland Security for doing very well, and \nthat is preparing, not scaring the public. There is a new tone. \nI applaud that. Let us remember that the successful layer of \nsecurity on Christmas day was a prepared public on that \nairplane.\n    So, finally, let me make one other point. There is \ntestimony submitted for the record of this hearing by the ACLU, \nand I have read that testimony, and I think it is extremely \nthoughtful. It reminds me that one piece of unfinished business \nsince the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 is the formation of a \nprivacy and civil liberties commission that was supposed to \noversee new practices to keep our country safer.\n    I wrote a letter to the President in October with Senator \nSusan Collins of Maine, and the White House has never responded \nto our letter. Insofar as I know, nothing has been done. I \nthink that this is unfortunate and will prevent us from \nassuring the public that we are enacting better practices \nconsistent with our Constitution.\n    But my one question, because time is running out, is to \neach of you. What are you personally going to do to assert \nleadership in the near- and medium-term to make certain that \nthe people under your supervision remain agile and responsive \nagainst an evolving threat by a learning organization?\n    Ms. Lute. Congresswoman, perhaps I will begin. You and I \nknow each other well. I take very seriously the \nresponsibilities of leadership, and I underscore \nresponsibility. I personally traveled to 12 countries in 12 \ndays with colleagues from the Department of Homeland Security \nto bring a message of leadership from the United States to our \ninternational partners with whom we have to work very closely \nto raise the standard of aviation security.\n    I personally spoke with the IAB officer on the ground in \nAmsterdam to understand from his perspective what more can we \ndo to change the system and to improve our ability to prevent a \nfuture event as occurred on Christmas day.\n    The Secretary equally has personally made aviation security \na cornerstone event of our efforts going forward in this, along \nwith other parts of the Department, who take very seriously its \nleadership role to help create a homeland where the American \nway of life can thrive. This is something we take extremely \nseriously.\n    Mr. Kennedy. Ma'am, the Secretary of State is incredibly \ninvolved in this, and she has charged me, and I think that I \nwould offer in the brief time I have two points, but there are \nothers.\n    The first, we need to continually increase our software \ncapability to take disjointed pieces of material and bring them \nto get together. The second thing we need to do is and I have \nto make sure that is happening, and I think that we also have \nto make sure that we remain and improve our lash-up with the \nNational security and the law enforcement community, because we \nare on the frontline.\n    But while we are on the frontlines, if we don't have the \nbackstopping that is the best that we can lash up, then we \nwould fail again. That is my pledge to make sure those happen.\n    Mr. Leiter. Congresswoman, I have spent a tremendous amount \nof time since December 25 with my workforce, my analysts, my \nwatch listers, my watch standards, and made clear to them many \nthings. One, I have to enable them to be able to do the job. If \nthey need something, they have to come to me, so I am making \nsure that lines of communication are more open than ever.\n    So one of the things I first said to them is I want to know \nfrom every one of them how do we do our job better. I did an \nopen e-mail to my entire organization. I probably got 200 \nresponses of what they think needs to be done.\n    The second thing I said to them in a way relates back to \nwhat the Chairman asked. I told all of them you have to ask \nyourself whether or not you can keep doing it, because this is \nhigh pressure. It is high stakes. You are going to get beat up \nin the public realm. You have to make sure that you can commit \nyourself 100 percent to this every single day. There is no \nembarrassment if they can't. We have to make sure that we have \na well-honed team that really stays on this.\n    Finally, the last thing I would say I am doing--I am not \ngenerally noted to be an especially patient person, but \nwhatever patience I have shown in the past in terms of trying \nto negotiate or massage interagency agreement to obtain data or \nto provide cooperation, frankly, I am done with it. I am going \nto ask once politely, and after that I am bringing to the White \nHouse and Director Blair and saying this has to be done. If it \ncan't be done, I can't guarantee you the security that I think \nyou and the American people deserve.\n    Could I add one thing, Mr. Chairman? I just want to note on \nthe record I endorse wholeheartedly the information that this \ncommittee needs to make a decision. You have my commitment from \nNCTC--I hope we have illustrated that in the past--to provide \nyou that completely and on a nonpartisan basis the information \nyou need to do your oversight correctly.\n    Chairman Thompson. Thank you.\n    The gentleman from Indiana for 5 minutes, Mr. Souder.\n    Mr. Souder. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    First, Mr. Kennedy, I would appreciate for the record if \nyou would--you said since 2001 you revoked 51,000 visas and \n1,700 for suspected links to terrorism--could you give us a by-\nyear number of visas revoked and number for suspected \nterrorism?\n    But, secondly, I know my friend from New York kept making a \npoint about Monday morning quarterbacking. As a Hoosier, when \nyou have Peyton Manning as your quarterback, you don't have to \ndo Monday morning quarterbacking. That is important here, \nbecause it is the person in charge, and the people in charge. \nWhen they fail is when we do Monday morning quarterbacking.\n    It is not the agent who didn't have the information who \nmessed up here, that as you see these people at the airports as \nyou go around the world, there were signals from the top to \nback off of profiling, don't focus as much, agents not focusing \nas much on capturing people as moving them through, not putting \nthings together.\n    I have some basic questions that we learned before, and I \nwas very disturbed at some of the briefing. My understanding is \nin public record that we didn't know he paid cash, because we \ndon't collect the information on cash, because 20 percent or \nsome percentage of people who do foreign travel pay by cash and \nthat that wasn't in his--we didn't know he paid cash. That is \npublic record. Is that true?\n    Mr. Leiter. I think it is true that we did not know he paid \ncash. One note, I would say, Mr. Souder. I think you are right. \nRoughly 20 percent of global passengers pay cash. That \nproportion, from the region he came from in Africa, is vastly \nhigher, so frankly, a cash payment for a ticket from where he \nbought his ticket really would not raise any suspicion.\n    Mr. Souder. We also didn't know that the British had him on \na no-fly list. Is that correct? That is publicly reported.\n    Mr. Leiter. The British did not have him on a \ncounterterrorism no-fly list. The British had----\n    Mr. Souder. But they had him on a no-fly list.\n    Mr. Leiter. He did not have a visa----\n    Mr. Souder. He didn't have a visa, so he couldn't fly.\n    Mr. Souder. So the question is, and this is what I would \nask you, in any type of basic tracking or intelligence, in \nnarcotics and that type of thing, you build a system. When a \nbusiness is trying to figure out risk of something, they build \na system.\n    The cash would not be relevant in normal, but the cash \nbecomes relevant if the father said this, and you knew you were \nwatching something from there, and you are tracking a ticket. \nThen all of a sudden the cash is relevant. The fact that he \ndidn't have a visa was not relevant, because it wasn't relevant \nto terrorism. But the fact that he was a liar on his visa form \nsuddenly becomes relevant, once you know that the father \ncalled, and he bought cash in that.\n    In other words there is a point system. My understanding is \nyou don't have a point system. Is that true?\n    Mr. Leiter. Congressman----\n    Mr. Souder. In other words there is no way to pyramid the \ninformation.\n    Mr. Leiter. Congressman, I don't think that is quite true, \nbut I don't want to quibble with your point, because I think \nyou are exactly right. Those individually----\n    Mr. Souder. Irrelevant things, yes.\na larger picture. I will say that over the past several years, \nas we have tried to ``accumulate data'' so all of that data can \nbe shared and analyzed together, one of the consistent \nchallenges we have faced at the National Counterterrorism \nCenter is these bits of data that aren't terrorism information, \nbut could add to that picture.\n    That has been one of the most significant obstacles we have \nfaced in making sure all that information can be effectively \nanalyzed.\n    Mr. Souder. But would you not agree that there are things \nwhere you are building a broad picture, and there are things \nthat are specifically relevant to getting on an airplane? In \nother words I know early on until they somewhat improved the \nsystem, that one time going through the Washington airport, six \nof the seven people in secondary where members of Congress. \nWhy? We got out early. We bought e-tickets. We paid cash.\n    That those are logical things you watch for in an airplane, \nand they build that, but you might not need them in your full \nterrorism bank. Do you have any ability to separate when you \nare getting on an airplane, when you are getting at something \nelse from kind of this general pool? Otherwise, you will have \nso much information that will be indecipherable.\n    Mr. Leiter. On that, Congressman, I would really defer to \nDeputy Secretary Lute on their screening----\n    Mr. Souder. Then let me tie a question with that, that we \nworked hard in the very original bill to make sure that \nHomeland Security was going to be at as many posts where they \nwere doing visas and as many posts at airports. You had 50 \ndeployments. Are you asking for more?\n    In other words the whole point of port security in airports \nis not to kind of arrest them after they have blown everything \nup. It is to get it before it gets here. Are you asking and \nrequesting more overseas deployments? Are you going to get this \nkind of information where they can say, okay, this is airplane \nspecific, this is harbor specific, as opposed to just general?\n    There may be something--for example, somebody's shipping \norders. That may be relevant in a port, but not relevant to the \ntotal counterterrorism center.\n    Ms. Lute. Congressman, on each of these lines we are doing \nmore. As you know, the Department of Homeland Security has no \nauthority abroad. But we do have programs where we have people \ndeployed for precisely this purpose. These are limited \nprograms. We have expanded them as Congress has given us the \nresources to do so. We will expand them again. We have expanded \nthem in the wake of this episode.\n    Mr. Chairman, if I could just make one thing very clear \nabout the Secretary's leadership and your presence today, as \nyou know, she had planned--there was international travel that \nconflicted with this hearing today. I was offered in part \nbecause I went abroad immediately at her direction with my \ncolleagues to raise some of the issues that you are raising \nabout the kind of information that we are collecting, about the \nkind of technology that we can deploy, about the weaknesses \nthat exist in the system and how we can work collectively to \nraise that bar.\n    Mr. Chairman, with your staff it was coordinated and agreed \nthat that I would appear for that reason.\n    Mr. Souder. With all due respect, it isn't true that you \nhave no authority abroad. You have the right to reject their \nentry into the United States.\n    Ms. Lute. Absolutely right, Congressman. There is no \nquestion. We do--we can----\n    Mr. Souder. A container doesn't have to come in. A person \ndoesn't have to come in. We have that authority.\n    Ms. Lute. That is correct. But to your point about \nadditional information, we have made that change in Homeland \nSecurity, taking information that previously under our pre-\nexisting protocols was related to admissibility and not putting \nit in the service of making flying determinations.\n    Chairman Thompson. Thank you.\n    Time has expired.\n    The Chair now recognizes Mr. DiFazio for 5 minutes.\n    Mr. DeFazio. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Ms. Lute, you know, we wouldn't have any imaging technology \ncapability today if it hadn't been for Kip Hawley. You know, I \nhave been a fan of this since I was first exposed to it about 8 \nyears ago. I kept bumping up against that ``Oh, my God, we are \ngoing to see people's skin or bodies or images'' or whatever.\n    Kip Hawley, you know, after a number of failed \nadministrators, really focused on this. He pushed it through. I \nkept saying, ``Isn't it just the way you get software? It \ndoesn't have to be your body. It can--'' and Kip finally got \nthat done.\n    So the point I am making here is we need a TSA \nadministrator. I am going to ask this question, which I asked \nMs. Napolitano last spring. Can't you just get it out of the \nway and allow the people in the TSA to unionize? It will not \nimpinge, unlike some wacko Republicans think, on National \nsecurity. Just get that out of the way so that won't be the \nthing that stalls the new TSA administrator.\n    She said she wanted to wait for an administrator to get it \ndone. You can't wait. She needs to make the decision, get it \ndone, give them those rights and get that off the table, and \nthen the next administrator can just deal with security issues \nand their history and background, and not this specious issue. \nThat is just a message I wish you would deliver to her, because \nshe said here, you know, to me quite some time ago she was \nwanting to move this forward, but she wanted to wait for the \nadministrator. Can't wait. Get it done.\n    Point No. 2, you know, the imaging technology is good. It \nmay or may not have worked in this case, but it has to be mated \nwith something that does vapor detection. Are we full out there \nworking on vapor detection or trace detection? You know, I mean \ndogs are great, but, you know, we need, you know, maybe, you \nknow, either we need a heck of a lot of dogs or, you know, we \nneed some technology that is more dependable than those puffer \nmachines.\n    Ms. Lute. You are absolutely right, Congressman. This \ntechnology does represent an improvement in our overall \ncapabilities, but it is only one part of a layered system. \nOther technology has to be brought to bear as well, as well as \nimproved processes, improved information gathering across the \nboard.\n    We are working very closely and have established a high-\nlevel working group with the Department of Energy and the \nNational labs to look precisely not only at are we using \nexisting technology to best effect, but what are the promising \nnew technologies that we can then add to these multiple layers \nto ensure the best safety and defense possible?\n    Mr. DeFazio. Okay.\n    To anybody, are all--I hate these stupid names; I don't \nknow, the Terrorist Identities Datamart entire and, you know, \nwhatever, TIDE? Are all the people on the TIDE list now \nselectees? I don't see why they wouldn't be. It is an \ninsignificant number of daily passengers compared to the number \nof people who fly daily. It would not be in an imposition. Are \nthey now also selectees?\n    Mr. Leiter. Congressman, they are not, although I must say \nI very much appreciate your sentiment. Frankly, from my \nperspective as the director of NCTC, it is no skin off of my \nback if they all were.\n    Mr. DeFazio. There are 500,000 of them. They are worldwide. \nThere are 3 million-something people fly a day. You know, I \nmean it would add significantly to the burden. Does Homeland \nSecurity object to this?\n    Ms. Lute. Homeland Security has no objection to that, to \nany measures that enhance the security of the traveling public.\n    Mr. DeFazio. Do you think that would enhance security, that \nanybody who is on the TIDE list is a selectee?\n    Ms. Lute. Rather than going----\n    Mr. DeFazio. Yes or no. I am running out of time.\n    Ms. Lute. If any--it takes----\n    Mr. DeFazio. You don't know.\n    Mr. DeFazio. Okay. All right. So you are sort of no.\n    Mr. DeFazio. Yes, yes.\n    Mr. Leiter. Again, I respect your views, and I am happy to \ndo it, but the pressure on NCTC, on DHS over the past 8 years \nhas never been in that direction.\n    Mr. DeFazio. All right.\n    Mr. Leiter. It has always been in the exact opposite \ndirection. So I just want to recognize this is a very changed--\n--\n    Mr. DeFazio. I understand, but, you know, Congress acted, \nand we pushed, and we have in place now an appeal system. So if \nsomebody is on that list, like John Lewis from Georgia, our \ncolleague, or, you know, former Senator Kennedy, others who get \non the list, you know, there is an appeals process. You can get \noff the list.\n    But why not err on the side of caution? Anybody on that \nlist becomes a selectee. They at least get that slightly higher \nlevel of screening. They have some interaction with a, you \nknow, with an officer, you know. I just think that to me, and \nagain, it would be a very, very, very infinitesimal percentage \naddition to the daily workload.\n    Mr. Leiter. Congressman, I agree in many ways----\n    Mr. DeFazio. Okay.\n40 or 50 times increase in the number of selectees we have \ntoday.\n    Mr. DeFazio. Yes, but I don't think so on a daily basis. It \nis 500,000 people on the list. How many of them fly on a daily \nbasis, you know, when there are 3 million people a day flying? \nI mean I just don't think it would be.\n    Mr. Leiter. But we currently have 14,000 on the Selectee \nthat would increase them 40 to 50----\n    Mr. DeFazio. Yes, but I know it would increase the list \nthat much, but in terms of daily workload, it would be nowhere \nnear that.\n    One other quick question to State. You talked about you \nhave the authority to immediately revoke a visa. You know, but \nyou want to communicate. Then you said, but if it was urgent, \nyou would act.\n    Have you ever had a recommendation the other way to you, \nthat you revoke a visa that you didn't revoke?\n    Okay. Thank you.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Chairman Thompson. Thank you.\n    Thank you very much. We have been told that some votes will \nhappen, and I have been fairly lenient with time. But in the \ninterest of giving every Member an opportunity to ask \nquestions, we will strictly adhere to the time.\n    The gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Rogers, for 5 minutes.\n    Mr. Rogers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    As everybody on this committee knows, for many years I have \nbeen a vigorous advocate of canines' use and remain that way, \nand I want to talk mostly about that.\n    Before I do, I want to visit the subject that my colleague \nfrom Oregon brought up about the administrator who was \nproposed. The administration didn't propose him until \nSeptember. I mean they had been in office 8 months, so if this \nwas such a priority with the administration, he should have \nbeen proposed earlier.\n    Secondly, you did raise the issue that I care about. That \nis canine use. Right after this Christmas day bombing, \nSecretary Napolitano in her remarks--White House press \nconference--listed three or four items that the Department was \ngoing to turn to to enhance our security layer system, and one \nof them was enhanced canine use.\n    I sent her a letter since then, expressing again, as I have \nin this hearing and in other venues, my concern that we aren't \nutilizing that asset enough. I know for a fact that TSA only \nuses 750 canines. These are very inexpensive, very effective \nmeans of technology.\n    You have stated in your statement, the written statement, \nin two different places that you have increased your use of \ncanine detection dogs, explosive dogs, in our transportation \nhubs. Can you tell me where and how many and what your plan is \non that asset?\n    Ms. Lute. In this open setting, Congressman, I am not going \nto detail any of the specific security measures that we have \ntaken, but we believe that canines are an important part of the \nmulti-layered defenses that we have been talking about. We look \nto use them to the greatest extent possible. We know their \nvalue. We are convinced of it, and we are going to expand our \nuse.\n    Mr. Rogers. Okay. But you haven't significantly expanded \nthem since the Christmas day bombing.\n    Ms. Lute. But we have in fact expanded them. But the \ndetails of that in this setting I am not prepared to explain.\n    Mr. Rogers. That is fine. I do want to get back with you in \na more private setting, but I want to address a new technology.\n    Currently, the Amtrak, the Capitol Police and the Federal \nProtective Service all use a new type of canine explosive \ndetection dog called a vapor wake dog. What it is is when \nsomebody walks by, the dog detects the vapors in their wake. We \nall leave a wake when we walk by. Explosives in particular \nleave the smell, the odor, there for 15 minutes in that wake. \nSo when it comes to transportation hubs like airports, bus \nstations, subways, whatever, the dog doesn't have to smell the \nperson directly. It can just step by when the person walks by.\n    All these entities use it, but TSA does not use it. The \nCapitol Police, as I said, uses it. The Secret Service is now \nlooking at it. They are going to probably start using it. Why \nhas TSA been so reluctant to use that technology?\n    Ms. Lute. Congressman, we focus on layered defense, as we \nhave been discussing here this morning, and we are examining \nall aspects of layers, including the increased use of canines. \nAs I mentioned, the Secretary has made very clear her \ndetermination that we look at promising new technologies, \ntechniques, canines, leave no stone unturned to increase the \nsecurity of the traveling public.\n    Mr. Rogers. Well, they are used extensively in Europe. One \nof the things I was hoping that Secretary Napolitano would do \nduring her trip to Europe--and I thought about it when she \nannounced it--was I am hoping that as a part of the agreements \nthat we worked out with our allies around the world, that for \nplanes that are destined to the United States, that we can at a \nminimum deploy dogs, canines to those airports to be at the \ngate of any plane that is leaving for the United States to make \nsure that at least those passengers are screened with that \nlayer of security that we have some control over.\n    If they want to let people get on the planes going \nelsewhere, that is their business, but if it is coming to this \ncountry, I want to make sure they are screened with every tool \nthat we have got in our toolbox. A frustration that I have got \nis we are spending billions a year on bells and whistles, and \nwe have a very simple technology that works, and we aren't \nusing it anywhere close to the level that we should be using \nit. So I would ask you if you are going to make this a priority \nis to go forward and in the near future.\n    Ms. Lute. Yes, sir. As the Secretary did make clear to her \nEuropean colleagues when they met together on this issue at her \nrequest, there are number of measures that need to be taken. \nThis is not a business-as-usual environment that we are in, and \nit takes the collaboration of all of us to be able to assure \nthe traveling public that we are doing ever we can to keep them \nsafe, including measures such as you have outlined.\n    Mr. Rogers. Great. Thank you very much.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Chairman Thompson. Thank you very much.\n    The Chairman now recognizes Representative Cleaver for 5 \nminutes.\n    Mr. Cleaver. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Ms. Lute, you addressed this already to some degree, and I \nam not sure how much you can discuss this issue here publicly, \nbut you had mentioned that you and the Secretary had traveled \nabroad in hopes of working out some cooperative agreements with \nour allies in this fight against terror.\n    One of the questions that maybe you can answer here, and I \nwould be interested in hearing, you know, some of the more \ndetailed information in the right setting, proper setting, but \nis there any willingness abroad to support what we are trying \nto do in terms of aviation safety for other countries to \ncontribute financially to enhance technological measures, I \nmean? Or are we the only Western nation that is engaged in \nspending a lot of money in trying to increase the technology or \ncreate more sophisticated technology?\n    Ms. Lute. Congressman, this was an extremely intensive \ntrip. My many years in the Army prepared me well for the \nconditions under which we were traveling.\n    The dialogue with our international partners could not have \nbeen more supportive. They recognize almost universally that \nthis is not a U.S. problem. This is not a Dutch problem. This \nis not a Nigerian problem. This is an international problem \nthat the responsible governments of the world must come \ntogether to address. Again, they all agree that in the area of \ninformation gathering and sharing, we need to do better, and we \ncan.\n    In the area of technology, we are not deploying existing \ntechnologies to best effect, and there are new and promising \ntechnologies. We are not the only ones with an investment in \ntechnology and reliance. It is one of the multiple layers of \ndefense that we have in place.\n    Equally, there is a recognition that this global system, as \nwe saw on Christmas day, with an access to any part of this \nsystem, you potentially have access to the entire system, so we \nall need to come together, and they recognize those \nresponsibilities. The Secretary is leading a series of regional \ndialogues leading to a major conference on this issue so that \nconcrete actions can be taken in the information sharing, \ntechnology, and system strengthening.\n    Mr. Cleaver. I have no other questions, Mr. Chairman. Thank \nyou.\n    Chairman Thompson. Thank you very much.\n    The Chairman now recognizes Mr. McCaul for 5 minutes.\n    Mr. McCaul. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    This was clearly a failure in intelligence. I think all the \nwitnesses have agreed to that. The President of the United \nStates has as well. It is more than a failure to connect the \ndots, as we talk about so much. It is a failure to identify \ndots or specific threat information coming in and acting upon \nit appropriately.\n    We had the Christmas bomber's father going to the embassy, \nwarning us about his son. The State Department issued a cable \nthat basically stated that and sent it to law enforcement, and \nI assume to the NCTC, stating that information had posted just \nthat Farouk may be involved in Yemeni-based extremists.\n    I think Members of Congress and the American people don't \nunderstand why with that type of information and Director \nLeiter with specific intelligence coming in through the IC, the \nintelligence community, why that wasn't linked together, No. 1, \nand why it wasn't acted upon to ensure that this man never got \non this airplane in the first place.\n    I think we agree that this visa should have been revoked \nimmediately, given the information. I can't get into the \nclassified information that you are privy to, but it was \nspecific. What happened here?\n    Mr. Leiter. Congressman, some action was taken, but as you \nhave identified, as I have talked, we would say it was \nobviously not sufficient, which was his name was entered into \nthe Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, but that didn't \nhave automatic repercussions in terms of screening, visa \nrevocation, or stopping him from boarding the plane.\n    The other intelligence simply wasn't identified and \nassociated with this individual. I can tell you that there was \nconcern on the intelligence community's part about potential \nattack by al-Qaeda in Yemen, and we were concerned even about \nthe timing of that. What we didn't connect was the individual's \nname or where that attack would occur. That was our failure.\n    Mr. McCaul. Was that because it was misspelled--the name \nwas misspelled? I mean to me, you know, if you type my name \ninto Google, for instance, M-C-C-A-U-L, they will say, did you \nmean M-C-C-A-L-L. and so do you not have a similar type of \ncapability?\n    Mr. Leiter. Actually, the misspelling did not affect NCTC \nin any way. It did affect, as I understand it, and I will defer \nto Under Secretary Kennedy on this, from our perspective when \nhis name was sent in, we actually put the spelling in both \nways. The technology we use, it wouldn't have made a \ndifference.\n    Mr. McCaul. Did you not have the cable that the State \nDepartment sent?\n    Mr. Leiter. We did, and we inserted the spelling based on a \nnumber of things.\n    Mr. McCaul. Yet you made the decision not to revoke the \nvisa, given that information?\n    Mr. Leiter. I don't have the authority to revoke a visa. \nThat is an authority----\n    Mr. McCaul. Right. Can't you call Secretary Kennedy and \nsay, ``You know, I think we have got a problem here. We ought \nto think about revoking this visa.''\n    Mr. Leiter. The intelligence community can, frankly. That \nnormally doesn't occur, if the nomination itself comes from the \nState Department, because----\n    Mr. McCaul. Well, I think there needs to be a lot better \ncoordination going on here between these two entities.\n    Mr. Kennedy, why, given the information that you had, why \nwasn't the visa revoked?\n    Mr. Kennedy. Sir, as I mentioned earlier, when we get any \ninformation, when anyone appears at an American embassy and say \nthat they have doubts about someone, we immediately generate \nwhat is called a Visas Viper message. We send that to the \nentire law enforcement and intelligence----\n    Mr. McCaul. My time is running out. I understand the \nprocess, but you had this information, and you didn't revoke \nthe visa.\n    Mr. Kennedy. Because----\n    Mr. McCaul. I mean the cable I just read----\n    Mr. Kennedy. Right.\nman is associated with extremists in Yemen. You didn't revoke \nhis visa.\n    Mr. Kennedy. What it was, sir, his father said he was \nassociated with this, and so we then asked the intelligence and \nlaw enforcement community if they had any other information. I \ndon't want to take much of your time. I would be glad to visit \nwith you afterwards.\n    Mr. McCaul. Well, I think the father is a very credible \nsource. This isn't some anonymous person coming in saying this.\n    Mr. Kennedy. We have people coming in, sir, to American \nembassies every day, attacking their relatives.\n    Mr. McCaul. Well, let me just--my time--this was a failure \nextraordinaire, and I sure hope it never happens again.\n    Deputy Secretary Lute, the last of my remaining time, they \nhave identified a vulnerability in our system. I am very \nconcerned about future flights now. The system didn't work. The \nscreening--you know, they are always a simple genius, you know. \nThey use chemical explosives, which would be detected through \nX-ray, but not through the magnetometer.\n    I know we are focusing on the 16 countries of interest in \nterms of pat-downs and more enhanced screening, but I am \nconcerned about still the majority of the airports out there \nwhere we are still vulnerable. They could still use this \ntechnique and get chemical explosives through the magnetometer. \nWhat is the Department of Homeland Security doing about that?\n    Ms. Lute. Congressman, we are not just focused on those 16 \nplaces that you have identified. We are focused on aviation \nsecurity globally and the traveling public, to ensure their \nsafety.\n    People have talked about silver bullets. We don't look for \nsilver bullets in Homeland Security. We know it takes a layer, \nmultiple measures of layers, not just by us, but by our \ninternational partners, and it takes constant vigilance.\n    We have made some adjustments internally now to take the \ninformation that we get, push it forward where we have teams on \nthe ground or to authorities in airlines where we don't have \nspecific teams. We are looking to expand our teams as well. \nThis is not a business-as-usual response. No one will be \nsatisfied----\n    Mr. McCaul. But my point is there are still many airports \nvulnerable to the same technique deployed by this terrorist.\n    Chairman Thompson. The gentleman's time has expired.\n    The gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Carney, for 5 minutes.\n    Mr. Carney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    I have to echo the sentiments of a number of our colleagues \ntoday, who I am very dismayed that the Secretary herself is in \nhere. I mean it is probably fair to ask where the hell is \nSecretary Napolitano for this hearing, to be quite honest.\n    I understand, Deputy Secretary Lute, that you are prepared \nand that is great, but she was invited. She needs to be here to \naddress something of this magnitude. My first question is why \nwas her first response to the public that the system worked?\n    Ms. Lute. Congressman, if I could, and I clarified before, \nthe Secretary had international travel that was originally \nconflicted. We coordinated with the Chairman's office. She has \nbeen in regular talks with the Chairman, other Members of this \ncommittee. She dispatched me with my colleagues around the \nworld to work aggressively with international partners, part of \nthe reason my appearance here was coordinated and agreed.\n    What the Secretary has made clear in her initial response, \nshe was responding to in the environment of what are we doing \nto address this concern now? How are responding to the \ninformation that we would have to ensure that there are no \nother flights that are subjected to any danger or that pose any \nthreat to the American public?\n    Mr. Carney. I want to shift gears slightly here. You and I, \nlast time we spoke, I believe, was New Year's Eve. That is \nright. How is the QHSR coming? Are we further down the road? \nAre we going to see it soon? Frankly, does the QHSR lay out a \nsort of chain of command that would obviate some of the issues \nwe are talking about today?\n    Ms. Lute. We did speak late New Year's Eve, in fact. The \nQHSR from our perspective is concluded. It is with the White \nHouse right now, ensuring final interagency coordination prior \nto release. As I mentioned to you, we are on schedule that I \ndiscussed with you.\n    We look for the QHSR, together with the bottom-up review of \nthe Department and a number of other measures that we are \ntaking internally to clarify roles and responsibilities in what \nis a significant enterprise for this country--that is, homeland \nsecurity.\n    We believe that the QHSR lays this out in a clear fashion, \nthe roles and responsibilities of other Members, other parts of \nthe Federal Government, State, local, law enforcement. It is an \nenterprise to ensure that this homeland is a place where the \nAmerican values, aspirations, and way of life can thrive.\n    Mr. Carney. Okay. Thanks. Just one more question, and you \ndidn't answer my second question, my first comment. Do you know \nwhy the Secretary said the system worked in her first reaction?\n    Ms. Lute. Congressman, as she has made clear, she was \nresponding to a series of questions that were also related to \nwhat are you doing in response to this information? What are we \ndoing now to ensure that the traveling public is safe--planes \nin the air, airlines? What information are we pushing out?\n    Mr. Carney. Thank you.\n    Mr. Leiter, I just have a couple of moments left. By the \nway, sir, I respect you enormously and what you bring to the \ntable, and I really want to know from your perspective, was \nthere a single point of failure, a double point of failure, \nmultiple points of failure in the Christmas day attack?\n    Mr. Leiter. Multiple.\n    Mr. Carney. Multiple.\n    Mr. Leiter. Yes.\n    I am trying to save you time, Congressman.\n    Mr. Carney. We will have a chance at some more questions, \nMr. Chairman?\n    Chairman Thompson. Well, we can, or we can submit them for \nthe record and get a response.\n    Mr. Carney. Okay.\n    Chairman Thompson. Multiple probably could go a long time.\n    Mr. Leiter. Congressman, if you would like me to expand, I \nalways can, but I was----\n    Mr. Carney. Well, no, no, as the Chairman of the Oversight \nInvestigation Subcommittee, I think maybe we will have you come \nin and chat with us a little bit. I will appreciate that.\n    No more questions, Mr. Chairman.\n    Chairman Thompson. Thank you very much.\n    I don't want the committee to be misled. I have talked with \nthe Secretary 2 days ago. We did not talk about her non-\nattendance or attendance at this hearing. Staff did communicate \nbased on a directive we received that the Secretary would not \nbe here, and we worked on Deputy Secretary Lute's presence.\n    That changed. At a minimum, based on that change, somebody \ncould have communicated back to the committee one way or the \nother that we told you we weren't going to be here, we are here \nnow, but we still can't come because of some other things. That \nis the courtesy I think the committee still deserves, and it \ndoes not require comment.\n    The gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Dent.\n    Mr. Dent. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Mr. Leiter, based on your testimony, your written testimony \nand also your testimony that you gave last week before the \nSenate, it appears you believe that the Federal Government did \nin fact collect the dots, but did not recognize the linkages \nbetween those pieces of information. Is that a fair assessment \nof your statement, your position?\n    Mr. Leiter. Yes, definitely.\n    Mr. Dent. Isn't it true that the NCTC is designed to be a \nmajor, if not the premier intelligence fusion and analysis \ncenter?\n    Mr. Leiter. We have the statutory responsibility to be the \nprimary analytic center for counterterrorism, and we along with \nthe CIA have primary responsibility on it.\n    Mr. Dent. Thank you.\n    I also understand that the Intel Authorization Act of 2010 \nthat passed the House Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence, but was not considered on the House floor, \nincluded sharp decreases in staffing levels for the Office of \nDirector of National Intelligence. Isn't it true that your \nstaffing at the National Counterterrorism Center is included in \nthose DNI staffing levels and could have been very negatively \nimpacted?\n    Mr. Leiter. Congressman, that is correct. As Director Blair \nnoted, I believe, last week, my discussions with him in \nDecember were about how I was going to absorb cuts of up to 20 \npercent of my personnel areas to include analytic and \nwatchlisting personnel.\n    Mr. Dent. So then do you have enough analysts to connect \nthese dots?\n    Mr. Leiter. Well, believe me, it is a very, very small \nsilver lining and not a silver lining I really wanted, but \nthose initial cuts have now been canceled for us. We have been \nworking with the DNI and the----\n    Mr. Dent. So you do have enough analysts?\n    Mr. Leiter. No. I have already discussed with the DNI, and \nhe has discussed with the Office of Management and Budget the \nneed for additional analysts and individuals to work on \nwatchlisting. So we enhanced those watchlisting records, so the \nright people are on the No-Fly list, the Selectee list. Right \nnow I don't have enough people to do that.\n    Mr. Dent. So you are saying, then, additional analysts, and \nnot fewer analysts, as HPSI proposed, that would help you \naccomplish your intelligence fusion mission?\n    Mr. Leiter. Yes, but I do want to make clear I don't look \nat this as this great opportunity to grow.\n    Mr. Dent. I understand.\n    Mr. Leiter. I look at it as the realization that we can't \ndo the mission as expected, and we weren't doing as well as we \ndid because of the assets we didn't have and the assets we were \npotentially losing.\n    Mr. Dent. Thank you, sir.\n    To Deputy Secretary Lute, I understand that while at the \nSchiphol Airport in Amsterdam, they have these full body \nimagers, as you know. They were not used at the checkpoints for \nthe flights bound for the United States on Christmas day. In \nfact, within the United States we have only 40 of these \nmachines at about 19 airports.\n    While I know that you can not guarantee protection, \nparticularly when you are relying on human interpretation of an \nimage, do you believe that the whole body imager would have had \na better chance of detecting or identifying Abdulmutallab's \nexplosive device than the current technologies employed at \nairports?\n    Ms. Lute. Congressman, we believe it represents an \nimprovement over our current capabilities, but again, it is \nonly part of a layered system.\n    Mr. Dent. Understood. In order to address privacy concerns, \nsome of the local vendors have developed these so-called auto \ndetection software for their whole body imaging equipment with \nthe goal of getting the TSA image observer out of the process. \nThis auto detection technology, I am told, is currently being \ntested over in Schiphol and in Amsterdam.\n    Is the TSA, the Transportation Security Lab, or the S&T \ndirector examining this auto detection technology? If so, when \ncan we expect to see some preliminary results?\n    Ms. Lute. We are examining all aspects of advanced imaging \ntechnology, whole body imaging. We are aware of some of the \ntechnologies that exist out there, and we are also engaging in \ndialogue with our international partners like the Dutch to see \nwhat they have, what they are using. We believe this is an \nenhancement.\n    We take the privacy concerns very seriously. There are a \nnumber of measures in place with respect to whole body imaging \nnow, the dislocation of the observer, the non-retention of \nimage. But we believe that this is an area where we don't want \nto settle for just existing technology, but also want to \nexplore most promising new.\n    But we also don't want this to take forever. We want to put \ntools in the hands of screeners now to enhance security.\n    Mr. Dent. Good. Then I hope you will certainly communicate \nwith our friends in the Senate that stripped the amendment that \nwas placed in the TSA authorization by the House that would \nrestrict the use of these whole body imagers.\n    Finally, there appears to be a debate on which advanced \ntechnology system is better--backscatter radiation or the \nmillimeter wave technology. Have you done an analysis on the \nhealth and safety of both of those types of systems? Did you \nidentify any risks in multiple daily exposures?\n    Ms. Lute. So, Congressman, I am aware that there are \ndifferences. I am not a scientist. Our science and technology \nfolks, together with the Department of Energy and the National \nlabs, are working with TSA on this and other technologies as \npart of a layered defense.\n    Mr. Dent. Could somebody report back to us? Could somebody \nsend a report back to us, which is the better technology?\n    Ms. Lute. Yes.\n    Mr. Dent. Thank you.\n    I yield back.\n    Chairman Thompson. Thank you.\n    We will get the gentleman's question answered by the \nDepartment. Be happy to.\n    The gentlelady from Ohio for 5 minutes, Ms. Kilroy.\n    Turn your microphone on.\nwithin their respective organization. I think coming before \nthis committee is part of that acknowledgment of responsibility \nand the oversight that it ruled as given to this body and to \nthe United States Congress.\n    I think it is critically important that once we acknowledge \nthe errors, that we also provide a plan or hear from you your \nplan to fix, to correct the problem, to make sure that people \naren't becoming complacent in the years since 9/11 and protect \nthe flying public. I thank those of you who made very clear \nstatements in your testimony, as you did, Director Leiter, \nabout that level of responsibility.\n    The more I hear about the Christmas bomber, the more I am \namazed at how he got on the plane. That continues today to \nreally stun me, that given the level of information, granted in \ndifferent parts of the system, that there was sufficient \ninformation that, at least to me, it seems that he should not \nhave been allowed onto that plane.\n    I keep learning things through hearings, through briefings, \nand through public news reports, that news reporters managed to \nget some information that had not been shared with the \ncommittee in prior briefings. But there was sufficient \ninformation, apparently, for him to be tagged for questioning \nwhen he got off the plane. I don't understand, I guess, why the \nCustoms and Border Protection was the agency that was charged \nwith questioning him when he got off the plane.\n    Ms. Lute. Congresswoman, that is we have standing protocols \nthat have been in place in this case since 2006 related to \nadmissibility issue questions. The Customs and Border \nProtection persons were prepared on the basis of that \ninformation to question him when he arrived.\n    We have changed that process. We now take that kind of \ninformation and push it forward to a pre-boarding opportunity \nthat individuals be questioned before they get on planes, \nprecisely because we recognize now that there is important \ninformation that can help us understand whether or not an \nindividual poses a threat to aviation security, and so we have \nchanged that process.\n    Ms. Kilroy. Well, I appreciate that things have moved \nforward and people will be getting questioned ahead of the \nprocess.\n    But when you have this incident that has occurred--and \nthank God that actions were taken that all passengers and crew \nwere able to get off that plane safely--but once you have this \nperson, who has attempted this atrocious act, when and who, \nwhat agency should be involved in taking custody of that \nperson? Who is trained to interrogate a terrorist? Who has \nultimate authority in the chain of command in this type of \nsituation?\n    Ms. Lute. I can only speak to the part about the \ninformation that we had regarding admissibility. No one is \nsatisfied that this individual got on this plane with this \nmaterial. It should never have happened, and we have to do \neverything we can so it doesn't happen again.\n    We are taking the information we have about admissibility. \nHe was at no time identified as a No-Fly or Selectee, which \nwould have triggered certain actions prior to his boarding.\n    Ms. Kilroy. I understand that, but he took actions on the \nplane. Everybody on the plane was aware of that. People on the \nground were aware of that. So are Customs and Border Patrol \nagents trained in the science of interrogating a terrorist that \nhas been taken into custody?\n    Ms. Lute. He was handed over to the Department of Justice \nand the FBI.\n    Ms. Kilroy. So the reports that I read that Customs and \nBorder Protection interrogated him for an hour before he was \nturned over to the FBI--you are saying that would be incorrect, \nthen?\n    Ms. Lute. No. Customs and Border Protection had him upon \npresentation for entry, and he was handed over to law \nenforcement officials.\n    Mr. Leiter. Congresswoman, if I--I got it.\n    Ms. Kilroy. Yes.\n    Mr. Leiter. He was initially arrested by the Customs and \nBorder Protection officers, who were there at the airport. \nImmediately upon being removed from the aircraft, he was \nimmediately turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n    Ms. Kilroy. I also want to endorse the line of questioning \nthat Congressman Rogers led with respect to the use of canines, \nbecause I think that they have amazing abilities to detect, and \nthey are very observant of body language as well as their use \nof different senses.\n    With respect to the changes in the visa process, have there \nbeen any changes in the length of visas that are going to be \noffered, allowed to people so they could come to this country?\n    Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Chairman, should I answer the question?\n    Chairman Thompson. The gentleman will answer the question.\n    Mr. Kennedy. I will be glad to see the Congresswoman and \ncome visit with her and discuss that or submit an answer for \nthe record, whichever you prefer, sir. I am prepared now.\n    Chairman Thompson. You can answer the question now.\n    Mr. Kennedy. Ma'am, it really doesn't matter whether a visa \nhas a validity of 1 day or 1 year. If information comes to us \non the day after a visa issue or 30 days after or 90 days \nafter, if the intelligence or law enforcement community comes \nto us and said, ``You cleared this person, because there was no \nrecord when you cleared them. We now have something new on this \nperson. That is, he or she is a danger to National security,'' \nwe revoke the visa that day.\n    Ms. Kilroy. Thank you.\n    Chairman Thompson. Thank you.\n    The gentleman from Georgia for 5 minutes, Mr. Broun.\n    Mr. Broun. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, during \nyour opening statement you seemed to blame the Bush \nadministration on this instance on Christmas day. To me there \nis a whole lot more going on here than just blaming President \nBush and his administration, because I think this \nadministration has a lot to blame, too.\n    Deputy Secretary Lute, I assume that you are just a good \nsoldier and carrying out the orders that you were given by your \nchain of command. You mentioned attempted attack, and they have \nactually--before your testimony, you just talked about that \nduring your discussion about the Secretary not being here.\n    I am incensed, frankly, that she is not here. Even the \nforeign visit was to brief people in Europe, and she ought to \nbe here briefing these people in this committee who have \nresponsibility to ensure the safety of the American public.\n    Also, the Secretary said that the system worked, which is \nhogwash. The Chairman asked if there was any disciplinary \naction being taken, and all of you all said no. Frankly, I am \nincensed by that, and I think the President of the United \nStates should ask for the resignation of Secretary Napolitano \nand get somebody there who is not in la-la land. Frankly, I \nthink she is in la-la land.\n    I don't know who else in your Department is, but whoever he \nis, they need to go, because the safety of the American people \nabsolutely is critical on having good leadership at the top. I \ndon't think we have that here in this country.\n    So I am incensed. I think other Members of this committee \nare incensed that the Secretary won't take her time to come \nhere and face this committee. I hope the President will take \ndisciplinary action and get rid of her and get rid of anybody \nelse in your-all's Department who are in denial, frankly, about \nthe seriousness of this.\n    In the United States Marine Corps, I was taught to know \nyour enemy. I have heard testimony from some other of the \nmembers of this panel. They seem to get it. But I don't think \nthe Department of Homeland Security, and I am not sure the \nPresident and his administration, get it.\n    We are facing not a war on terror. We are facing a war \nagainst a group of fascists in this country who hate this \nNation, hate everything we stand for, including the freedom, \nincluding the freedom we give to women, and they want to \ndestroy this Nation. We must as a Nation start facing the fact \nthat these are Islamic fascist terrorists, who want to use that \ntactic in a war. Terrorism is only a tactic. We are not \nfighting terrorism. We need to stop talking about that.\n    To me the failure here is political correctness gone amok. \nThere are many Members of this committee, principally on the \nother side, who don't want profiling. We just had a hearing \nabout the undocumented attendees to a State dinner. We have got \na lot of undocumented attendees in this Nation that the State \nDepartment allows to come into this country, and some that are \ndocumented.\n    We need to change the whole philosophy of how we are trying \nto protect this Nation. I don't think we are doing a proper \njob. Frankly, I am incensed. I hope the President will start \npaying attention to what is going on here and will stop this \ninane thought of not profiling people that are entities that we \nknow hate our Nation and will do what is necessary to protect \nthe American public and keep this Nation safe.\n    Mr. Pascrell. Will the gentleman yield?\n    Mr. Broun. No, I won't.\n    Mr. Pascrell. You won't yield?\n    Mr. Broun. No, I won't.\n    Mr. Pascrell. Okay.\n    Mr. Broun. Because I have got just a minute left, and so I \nwant----\n    Mr. Pascrell. I will just say it later, so it doesn't \nmatter.\n    Mr. Broun. But it is absolutely critical that this \nadministration take serious our enemy. America needs to know \nits enemy. It is radical--it is a bunch of radical folks all \nover the world, who want to destroy it. They are going to \ncontinue to attack us.\n    Whole body imaging is not going to prevent, and even the \ncanines are not going to prevent, bombings. There is no way \nunless we search every body cavity on every person who wants to \ncome into this Nation.\n    But we know one of the big, glaring, flashing dots is \nradical Islam. We have got to start focusing upon that. There \nis absolutely no question about that. Our people are going to \ndie. Those who are worshiping at the altar of political \ncorrectness are going to--that worshiping at the altar of \npolitical correctness and not profiling our enemies is going to \nresult in killing American citizens.\n    With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. My time is up.\n    Chairman Thompson. Thank you very much.\n    The gentleman's time has expired.\n    We have two votes scheduled, and we expect to return in \nabout 25 minutes. The committee stands in recess."

"","","leiter","Michael E. Leiter","    Chairman Thompson. We would like to reconvene the recessed \nmeeting.\n    We now will begin questioning with the gentlelady from \nNevada, Ms. Titus.\n    Ms. Titus. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I do have a \ncouple of questions. I would like to start with Mr. Leiter.\n    On several points in your written testimony, maybe not so \nmuch in your oral testimony, you note that the intelligence \ncommunity possessed strategic intelligence regarding al-Qaeda \nin the Arabian Peninsula, and you note that they had--and I put \nthis in quotes--``had the intention of taking action against \nthe U.S. prior to the failed attack on December 25, but we did \nnot direct more resources against them nor insist that the \nwatch list criteria be adjusted prior to the event.''\n    You also note that the NCTC and intelligence community had \nlong warned of the threat posed by this group in the Arabian \nPeninsula. But it appears that despite your intelligence on \nthis and your concern about it expressed here, that the \nnecessary steps weren't taken to prevent this.\n    So I want to ask you who was receiving your reports about \nthis intelligence? Why do you think they didn't respond to it \nin the appropriate way?\n    Mr. Leiter. Congresswoman, I think everything you said is \ncorrect in terms of encapsulating my statement. All of the \nintelligence we write goes to a broad array of consumers \nranging from the President to the members of the Cabinet, \ndeputy secretaries and the like.\n    I wouldn't say, though, that nothing was done. It is that \nthe things that were done turned out not to have been ones that \nstopped this threat. There was forceful action taken on a \nnumber of fronts to try to disrupt various threats from al-\nQaeda in Yemen. What it didn't do is detect this thread or stop \nthis particular individual.\n    Now, steps were taken. Why do I think that we didn't shift \nenough focus onto this individual? I do think that al-Qaeda in \nthe Arabian Peninsula, although we saw a desire and a \npossibility to strike the homeland, I don't think we fully \nrealized the speed with which they had moved and actually put \nthat desire into action.\n    Ms. Titus. Well, I would ask you going forward, which is \nthe important thing, do you think we are putting enough \nresources and enough attention on this growing threat in the \nArabian Peninsula?\n    Mr. Leiter. I think we have begun to move those resources. \nI still don't believe we have all the resources we need. I \nwould also add that I remain particularly concerned, as I have \ntestified before this committee and others previously, I remain \nparticularly concerned not just about Yemen, but also in \nSomalia and the flow of Americans of largely Somali descent to \nSomalia. I think that poses a similar threat. Although Yemen is \nthe subject of today's hearing, we have to remain very, very \nfocused again on Somalia and, of course, on Afghanistan and \nPakistan.\n    Ms. Titus. Do you feel like the people who are higher up, \nall this group that you report to, are taking your warnings \nseriously?\n    Mr. Leiter. I think without a doubt. I believe the \nPresident's immediate direction on shipping resources, Director \nBlair's intervention here to make sure we have the resources, \nand the rest of the intelligence community, I think we have.\n    Ms. Titus. Well, we need to. There is no question about \nthat.\n    Mr. Leiter. I agree with you wholeheartedly.\n    Ms. Titus. Just one other quick question for Ms. Lute. I \nwould ask you--now, we have put so much focus on the \ninternational flights, because this incident was an \ninternational flight, but we can't forget that 9/11 involved \ndomestic flight. We are not ignoring them or letting them go by \nthe wayside as we now suddenly focus on Schiphol, are we?\n    Ms. Lute. Absolutely right, Congresswoman. We are not \nneglecting any part of the aviation security systems, nor are \nwe neglecting our land and sea borders, as we have this \nparticular focus on air. We have a number of measures in place \nacross the board to enhance our vigilance, increase our \ninformation gathering and sharing, as we have been discussing, \nworking with technology in this multi-layer defense \ndomestically as well as internationally.\n    Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.\n    Chairman Thompson. Thank you very much.\n    The gentlelady from Michigan, Mrs. Miller, for 5 minutes.\n    Mrs. Miller. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n    You know, there have been lots of questions from my \ncolleagues about the process and the failures of our protocol, \net cetera. Many people have commented about the absence of \nSecretary Napolitano, and I would associate myself with those \nremarks.\n    However, I will also say that it is stunning to me that \nAttorney General Holder or nobody from the Department of \nJustice is here to talk to this committee and to testify to \nthis committee. I would respectfully request that at some point \nhe does testify before this committee.\n    Our responsibility is to have oversight, and I want to \nfocus, I think, on what has happened since the attempted act of \nwar, because that is what it was. It wasn't a criminal act. It \nwas an act of war by a terrorist, an enemy combatant. I was \nstunned that this terrorist was not turned over to the \nmilitary.\n    Again, I am just incredibly dismayed no one from the DOJ is \nhere. Yet, it was they, under the direction of Attorney General \nHolder, that made this decision to turn this terrorist over to \nthe FBI, and not as an enemy combatant. He made the decision. I \nbelieve that the attorney general is creating a culture at the \nDepartment of Justice that fosters an ideology of approaching \nthis war on terror like a simple police action.\n    I will cite a couple examples of why I say that, because I \ndo believe it is dangerous to our security, and I am very \nconcerned about it. We know, for instance, that before becoming \nthe attorney general, Eric Holder and his law firm represented \naccused terrorists that were in the custody of the military, \nand he urged their release to the civilian justice system. That \nincludes Jose Padilla. They were very proud about giving free \npro bono legal service to 17 Yemeni and one Pakistani, who \ncurrently are at Gitmo.\n    We know that he and President Obama have placed many of \nthese attorneys in high-ranking positions at the Justice \nDepartment--again, attorneys that provided free, top-flight \nlegal assistance to enemy detainees.\n    I mean my husband's an attorney. I know a lot of attorneys. \nYou might have pro bono work for a child abuse case, domestic \nviolence case. This is what they decided they wanted to give \nfree legal advice to: Enemy detainees.\n    We also know that the attorney general has stonewalled \nSenator Grassley, who is attempting to discover who these high-\nranking Justice officials are and what their role is in making \nthese decisions.\n    We know that the attorney general has been a huge advocate \nto close Gitmo and to bring these detainees to the United \nStates. We know that the attorney general has made the decision \nto bring KSM and others implicated in the 9/11 conspiracy to \nNew York City for trial without consulting any security \nofficials in New York or other high-ranking officials in the \nmilitary or intelligence communities.\n    Our Ranking Member mentioned that he had not consulted \nthem--actually, I think it was on the Jim Lehrer Show, where he \nsaid he consulted his wife and his brother before he made that \ndecision. So I have concern with that.\n    We also know that in this instance the attorney general did \nnot share, in the instance of the Christmas day bomber, that he \ndid not share the intelligence gleaned from the Christmas day \nbomber with the military or intelligence officials before \ngiving the Miranda rights to this terrorist.\n    I know the President has said that no one is accountable, \nor that no one will be held accountable, no single person, but \nI believe that President Obama must hold Attorney General Eric \nHolder responsible for the loss of additional intelligence that \nwould have been gained to protect our citizens from future \nattack.\n    He has been rather flippant, I would say, in saying that he \nis not afraid of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed being given a platform \nto spout his anti-American rants in our justice system. He says \nwe have nothing to fear from giving terrorists constitutional \nrights and access to our court. I disagree.\n    I am the only Member of this committee from the Detroit \narea, and this incident may have faded in the front of many \npapers, newspapers, and media across our Nation, but I will \ntell you in Detroit we are looking every single day at this \nterrorist, this enemy combatant, an act of war against America, \nwho was treated at the University of Michigan Burn Center, \nwhich is probably the best burn center in the entire world, and \nnot only given one free court-appointed, taxpayer-funded \nattorney, he has three--three--attorneys.\n    We are looking every day at what is happening at the \nFederal building in the city of Detroit, all of the expense \nthat is being taken on by the Detroit Police Department at a \ntime they can't afford that kind of expense, and other security \nofficials, just to make sure that we have no incident there.\n    The first thing this guy hears when he gets off the \nairplane is, ``You have the right to remain silent.'' Here is \nyour great justice system that we are having here in America. \nIt makes me crazy.\n    In the absence of anyone from the Department of Justice, \nlet me just ask Director Leiter. Do you think that Attorney \nGeneral Eric Holder's decision to Mirandize this guy denied us \nthe opportunity to garner very valuable information? Do you \nthink that if we got a terrorist in Afghanistan or Yemen or in \ntheater and we only interrogated him for 50 minutes, that that \nwould be adequate?\n    Mr. Leiter. Congresswoman, I will try to answer, of course. \nI mean I am not from the Department of Justice. One thing I do \nwant to correct, though. I don't believe it is correct that the \ninformation that was garnered during those initial 50 minutes \nof interrogation was not shared with the intelligence community \nor with the Department of Defense. I say that, because I was on \nthe video teleconference that evening, and----\n    Mrs. Miller. If you could, just a moment. I recognize he \ndid share the information, but he did not share the information \nthat he was going to Mirandize this, and that was my point. \nNobody was asked about that. That was Attorney General Eric \nHolder's decision, apparently.\n    Mr. Leiter. I apologize, Congresswoman. I understood. I \njust did want to make clear that the information that they \ngarnered was immediately shared with the intelligence \ncommunity. It was put to action. I think there was information \nthat was garnered from that initial 50 minutes of interrogation \nthat has been quite valuable.\n    Mrs. Miller. Well, my time has expired, so I would just \nsimply say that, Mr. Chairman, we are facing a new type of \nenemy who doesn't consider the battlefield to be just in Yemen \nor in theater. The battlefield that day was Seat 19A on that \nNorthwest flight, and these are enemy combatants. I think it is \ndangerous for America to treat them as civil criminals. Thank \nyou.\n    Chairman Thompson. Thank you very much.\n    For the record, as you know, the Minority has an \nopportunity to request a witness, and it could have very well \nbeen the Minority's option to request Attorney General Holder \nfor this hearing, and they did not.\n    The Chairman recognizes the gentlelady from New York, Ms. \nClarke, for 5 minutes.\n    Ms. Clarke. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n    Let me just say that as a New Yorker, I know that it is \npossible that we have under previous administrations tried \nindividuals who seek to do us harm--terrorists, if you will--in \ncivilian courts and been very successful there. So, you know, I \nthink that this is an issue we can go back and forth with.\n    But I think that we have to also make sure that in doing so \nwe don't manifest through our conversations just the outcomes \nthat we are seeking to prevent. That is encouraging others, by \nlabeling enemy combatants, to become enemy combatants.\n    I think that we have the power and an expertise in our \nNation to address all of these concerns, and that is why we are \nhere today to encourage one another to use those talents and \nexpertise to do what needs to be done to protect the American \npeople. Certainly, as we review our failures and our mistakes, \nwe learn from them to strengthen ourselves as a Nation, to do \nwhat has to be done to protect the American people.\n    So having said that, my concern has to do with our ability \nto manage these databases. I have felt all along since, really, \nhearing from constituents in my constituency that they have had \na very hard time getting off these lists, that we were building \na quagmire. I say that, because at a certain point the list \nbecomes the proverbial trying to find the needle in a haystack, \nwhen you are not purging it, when you are not moving people \nthrough the cleared list.\n    So I am just concerned that as we build out this data \ninfrastructure to be able to find individuals, to communicate \nin real-time about individuals that we may have on one list, \nbut may not be on another, that the time that it takes to scan, \nto data input, because it is my understanding that particularly \nin the TIDE database, that there are people with similar names \nin addition to the actual name. I am sure once you sort of plug \nin a name, you are going to get a list of names.\n    I want to raise the question with each of you about how we \nrefine our capacity through data maintenance and gathering to \nbe able to do that type of ID in real-time. The GAO has found \nthat agencies involved in screening international visitors to \nthe United States do not screen individuals against all records \nin the watch list.\n    Can we say that the system has become too cumbersome for \naccuracy of screening to become more difficult over time? I \nwould like to get that response from each of you.\n    Ms. Lute. Congresswoman, perhaps I will begin, and then \nDirector Leiter may want to add to it.\n    There is an enormous amount of data being gathered. It is \none of the tools that we use for aviation screening, and we use \nit for other purposes as well. We are constantly refining our \nprocesses to ensure that we have the accurate information of an \nindividual that is in these databases.\n    One of the issues that I raised in my conversations with \ninternational colleagues, and the Secretary certainly \nemphasized as well, is creating a standard for passenger name \nrecords so that we have as much information as we possibly can \nabout individuals. Are they who they say they are, and are they \nfulfilling the intent they declare?\n    We do and have created a sort of one-stop for de-\nconfliction when people find themselves on a database \nerroneously. It is called the Travelers Redress Information \nProgram. It is not yet a perfect system, and we acknowledge \nthat, but we are working very hard to address it.\n    Mr. Leiter. Congresswoman, believe me, I am very \nsympathetic to your concerns, because I have the responsibility \nto get through all of this data and make sure it is clean. We \nwant it as clean a system as we could have. I will note a \ncouple of things.\n    First, I think it is important to note that United States \npersons make up a very small percentage of our high database, \nvery small percentage. In fact, you can only be in our database \nif you are the subject of an active FBI investigation. Within \n24 hours of that investigation being closed, you are purged. I \nthink we have a very good record for meeting that standard. So \nI think that is point No. 1.\n    Point No. 2, are there simply better ways of doing this? \nThere undoubtedly are. Any names-based screening system has \ninherent weaknesses. It requires not just a name, but you also \nwant additional data about that person if you can, whether it \nis a birth date or a passport number.\n    The next step, really, is moving towards greater \nintegration of biometrics. Under Secretary Kennedy has already \nnoted some of those advances that we have made. I think both at \nthe initial screening when someone is getting on an aircraft, \nbut certainly when they are getting a visa, when they arrive at \na port of entry, the integrated use of biometrics, which is \nthere already, is extremely helpful.\n    It has to be expanded. There is a significant resource \ntail, and there is also a significant civil liberties concern \nthat have to be addressed as we do this. But we know that is \nthe right way to go.\n    Chairman Thompson. Thank you very much.\n    The Chairman now recognizes for 5 minutes, Mr. Olson.\n    Mr. Olson. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n    Before I get started on my line of questioning, I would \nlike to identify myself with my colleague from Michigan's \nremark on the decision to use the criminal justice system of \nour country instead of the military justice system to prosecute \nthis individual.\n    Very briefly, what I have understood is when he was brought \noff that aircraft after he had tried to kill all the people \naboard that plane, he was taken into custody, was taken to the \nhospital for medical treatment.\n    Two FBI agents began asking questions. He was giving them \nactionable intelligence for at least 50 minutes, intelligence \nthat saves lives. Those agents that were asking those \nquestions--there is an exception to the Miranda rights that if \nyou believe there is imminent information that is going to save \nlives--there is another bomb on an aircraft or, as we saw \nunfortunately on September 11, there are other aircraft in the \nair with bombers like Mr. Abdulmutallab on it--then they have \ndiscretion to ask questions. Again, for 50 minutes, by reports, \nthey got actionable intelligence information.\n    Five hours later, another group, a ``clean team,'' showed \nup. The first thing they did was read him his Miranda rights. \nNo surprise, he hasn't talked since then. We will never know \nwhat information we have lost and what risks and what damage we \nmay put to our country by not interrogating him fully and \ngetting all the information he had to learn about what al-\nQaeda's doing in Yemen.\n    I would like to change tactics here, change the tone of \nmy--I want to talk a little bit about--you know, one thing that \nI believe is the most information we can have and the quicker \nwe get it, the earlier in the whole process, the better chance \nwe have to thwart it.\n    As we know Mr. Abdulmuttalab, it seems to be that he got, \nat least from the information I have had, that his \nradicalization, his radicalization happened while he was going \nto school in Great Britain in England. The British intelligence \nstates he is--Islamic student organization in their fight \nagainst extremism. Abdullahmatal--I am sorry--Abdulmutallab was \nthe fourth president of an organization like that in Great \nBritain to be charged with a terrorism-related offense.\n    My question is is extremism on college campuses something \nthat the intelligence community is focused on, both abroad and \nhere at home?\n    Mr. Leiter. Congressman, I would be happy to talk about \nthis more in a closed hearing. I will say we have worked very \nclosely with the British as they look at their groups. We have \nconsistently seen connections between terrorists threatening \nthe United States and terrorist activity in the United Kingdom.\n    One of the things we have done as a response to this is \nreinvigorate that information sharing to make sure that we have \nfull visibility into whether or not it is the schools or the \ngarage mosques or simply the splinter groups. I agree with you. \nWe have to make sure this information is shared very quickly.\n    Mr. Olson. Have we seen anything here domestically akin to \nwhat is going on in Great Britain?\n    Mr. Leiter. Congressman, we have never seen within the \nUnited States nearly the scale, scope, depth of radicalization \nthat we have seen in the United Kingdom. We have pockets of it, \nand we are concerned with it. I wouldn't associate it with any \nsingle environment within the United States.\n    Mr. Olson. Thanks for that.\n    One more question. Maybe I appreciate if it is two \nsentences across the line in the classification system. But one \nindividual I am concerned about, and I hope I pronounced this \nright, is Sheikh Anwar al-Awlaki, who had contact, we know, \nwith Mr. Abdulmuttalab, probably in Yemen, probably as part of \nthe, you know, the organization that helped him get trained and \ncertainly can keep him indoctrinated.\n    Also concerned as a Member from Texas. Apparently, there \nwere e-mail contacts between him and Captain Hasan who, as you \nknow, killed 13 soldiers at Fort Hood. I am just concerned. Do \nyou know of any other? He is using 21st century technology--\nvideos, teleconferencing technology, particularly, you know, of \nsending that signal to England and Great Britain again. I know \nI am harping on them, but is there any evidence that he has \nbeen doing that home here in our country?\n    Mr. Leiter. Congressman, I really can. I can't go into \ngreat depth here. I will tell you that the intelligence \ncommunity has been concerned with the activities of Anwar al-\nAwlaki for some time. He was initially investigated in \nassociation with the events of 9/11, when he was an imam in San \nDiego, later in Northern Virginia.\n    I can tell you that even well before Major Hasan, but \ncertainly after the events of Fort Hood, NCTC, the FBI and \nother agencies have been very, very focused on Awlaki, but also \nother individuals like Awlaki, who are savvy to Western ways, \nWestern technology, modern technology, and their ability to \nreach into our border through this technology.\n    Mr. Olson. I see that I have run out of time. Thank you \nvery much. Stay on him. Thanks.\n    Chairman Thompson. Thank you very much.\n    The gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Pascrell.\n    Mr. Pascrell. Chairman, thank you.\n    Mr. Chairman, many of us have stressed one thing as Members \nof this committee. If there is one thing we have stressed, it \nis that the bureaucracy itself is as great a threat to our \nNational security as anything else. You heard the bureaucracy \ntoday, part of it.\n    Let me just point out that Congress is not exempt from this \ncriticism. Indeed, this is at least the fourth of different \nfull committees to hold a hearing on the attempted attack of \nDecember 25. This strikes me as entirely counterproductive to \nwhat we are trying to accomplish.\n    It seems crystal clear to me that the events of December 25 \nwere allowed to occur, because once again we have failed to \nconnect things in the information that we already had, we \nalready knew about. Once again, our intelligence agencies \nfailed to communicate with each other. This is a human error, \nnot an electronic error.\n    We spend a lot of time talking about the state-of-the-art \nof these machines that are in airports and aren't in airports. \nWe have not told the American people the truth. Many binary \nexplosives are not detectable at this point.\n    We established a Director of National Intelligence, the \nDNI, to serve as the head of the intelligence community. It \nconsists of 16 different agencies spread throughout the Federal \nGovernment--16. Each of these intelligence agencies have \ndifferent standards for their personnel--each of them. 9/11 9 \nyears ago--they still have different standards.\n    I would conclude that you are not going to get the proper \nrelationship amongst these agencies until you have basic \nstandards. In fact, the agency within all of the 16 that has \nthe toughest standards is the CIA. I would begin there.\n    But we established that position of Director of National \nIntelligence to finally provide some leadership and guidance \nover the intelligence community so that we could finally close \nthe gaps in this information sharing. Clearly, we are not there \nyet.\n    What troubles me most about this incident was that we \nallowed this individual to receive a visa in the first place to \nenter the United States. I think of all those families who have \ntried to get united and were denied a visa, because they \nthought if they came to the United States, that they wouldn't \ngo back. Many of those cases were adjudicated correctly. Many \nof them were not.\n    We never took steps to revoke his visa before he entered a \nforeign airport to travel. We already had negative information \non this individual. Not only had the State Department spoken to \nhis father, but we knew that he traveled to Yemen. For young \nmen to travel from Nigeria to Yemen with no known legitimate \npurpose--that should raise a number of red flags.\n    Mr. Leiter, Director Leiter of the National \nCounterterrorism Center, is often described as the arm of our \nintelligence community that is responsible for--I hate the \nphrase, and probably you do, too--connecting the dots on \nintelligence gathering. Do you agree that is your primary role \nand responsibility? If so, doesn't that hold you primarily \nresponsible for the failure to connect the dots on the \nintelligence we already had on this individual?\n    Mr. Leiter. Absolutely. I said several times, Congressman, \nNCTC is the primary analytic organization. It was our \nresponsibility to do this. We didn't do that. There was another \norganization that also had responsibility under the DNI's \nstandards. That didn't occur there either.\n    Mr. Pascrell. Do you wonder why some of us have concluded \nthat maybe we have added an extra layer of bureaucracy to the \nintelligence apparatus that is slowing us down to get to the \ngoal line? Do you wonder why we think that at times? Or do you \nthink that the DNI is absolutely necessary to stop those who \nwish to bring harm to our families, to our neighborhoods, and \nto our borders? What are your thoughts? I know you work for \nthem. What are your thoughts?\n    Mr. Leiter. Congressman, I think the DNI is a useful \nconstruct to advance intelligence reform. I do not think that \nthe DNI in this case, this construct or the layers, was the \nproblem. I mean I think many of the weaknesses you have \nidentified are fair weaknesses. I just don't think they were \nthe issue that caused this failure here today.\n    Mr. Pascrell. Do you have the authority you need to work \nwith intelligence across our Federal departments and agencies? \nDo you have the authority to do that?\n    Mr. Leiter. Congressman, it is not easy for an----\n    Mr. Pascrell. I am not saying it is easy. Believe me, I am \nnot, Mr. Leiter. But my question is very specific.\n    Mr. Leiter. I do not, nor do I believe the DNI, as \ncurrently constructed, has all of the authority necessary to \nmove all of the information in a way that will maximize the \nlikelihood of detecting these plots.\n    Mr. Pascrell. Mr. Chairman, I hope that--and I know you \nwere listening, and the Ranking Member, to the last answer. The \ngentleman has been forthright. I thank him for his service to \nhis country. We have created--my conclusion, not their \nconclusion--a monster. We will never get the safety of the \nAmerican citizens as we build these levels of bureaucracy that \ndo not get to the heart of the issue.\n    I would ask you to go back----\n    I would ask you to go back, Ms. Lute----\n    I would ask you to go back, Mr. Kennedy--to look at this \nbureaucracy as being the systemic problem. This is human error, \nbut maybe it is human error precipitated by the fact that we \nhave created a bureaucratic nightmare so that no one is held \naccountable. That is why you create bureaucracies, you know.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Chairman Thompson. Thank you very much.\n    The gentleman's time has expired, but we always recognize \nhis leadership.\n    Mr. Leiter, In light of your question, we are going to ask \nyou to provide us what authority you think you need in order \nfor you to do your job in a manner you deem necessary.\n    Mr. Leiter. Mr. Chairman, I am happy to do that, and I \nwould work with the DNI. I would add that although I say that, \nI don't have any particular authorities right now that would \nquickly ensure that every bit of this data is shared with every \nother component of the intelligence community.\n    Chairman Thompson. I understand, but you just said in \nresponse to the gentleman from New Jersey's question that you \ndon't have it.\n    Mr. Leiter. Mr. Chairman, I am happy to go back, and we \nwill come back with recommendations to you.\n    Chairman Thompson. Thank you very much.\n    The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, for 5 minutes.\n    Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    I thank the witnesses for appearing today.\n    I believe, as has been indicated, this was a failure of \nintelligence, but I would like to make sure that I state that \nit was not a failure of all intelligence personnel. I say this, \nbecause we have many people who risk their lives on a daily \nbasis. Some, by the way, lose their lives, as was evidenced by \nthe recent event that we need not go into.\n    Their families--they see these hearings. I don't want their \nfamilies to assume that I have concluded that all intelligence \nofficers are failures, because I want them to have the morale \nnecessary to do a very difficult job under circumstances that \nare extremely complicated, and sometimes almost impossible, if \nnot impossible.\n    I believe that the structural integrity of a plane at 3,000 \nfeet traveling at 500 miles per hour is of paramount \nimportance. It is as important as anything that we deal with. \nBecause the structural integrity of that plane is so important, \nI want a system that will reveal and allow us to capture the \nOmar Farouk Abdulmutallab.\n    But I also want a system that will capture the \nAbdulmutallab who doesn't pay cash, the Abdulmutallab who \ndoesn't ask for Seat 19A, the Abdulmutallab whose father \ndoesn't turn them in. I want a system that will capture the \nAbdulmutallab whose religion I am not aware of.\n    If we focus only on connecting the dots that could have \nbeen connected to the exclusion of designing a system that will \nallow us to capture the Abdulmutallabs who are not obvious, who \nare not intuitively obvious to the most casual observer, if you \nwill, it would be a mistake.\n    We must have a system that will reveal the Abdulmutallab \nwho is Anglo-Saxon and has blond hair, because this beast that \nwe have to deal with continually metamorphoses. It becomes \nsomething else somewhere else. If we only assume that it will \nbe tomorrow what it is today, we will make today's mistake, and \nit will impact tomorrow.\n    So the system that I am looking for is one that will allow \nus to understand, in my opinion, that the last line of defense \nis the airport. That is the last line of defense. The American \npeople don't ask us to do the impossible. They do demand, \nhowever, that we do all that we can--that we do all that we \ncan.\n    At some point the excuse that we didn't do all that we \ncould is not going to be enough for the American people. So we \nhave got a duty at these airports to do all that we can. We owe \nit to the intelligence officers who risk their lives every day \nto make sure that we do all that we can at the airports, our \nlast line of defense.\n    A quick question, if I may. Did we know the religion of \nRichard Reid prior to December 2001?\n    Mr. Leiter. I don't believe so. I don't think we knew \nanything----\n    Mr. Green. I think that that answer suffices. The reason I \nasked is because if we focus on religion and then some other \nadjectives, we are missing a point here. I want to capture the \nculprit whose religion may not be the religion du jour for our \npurposes. This is serious business, and it goes beyond the \nability to simply identify that which is superficial, the \nsuperficial social analyst who can come in after the fact and \nconnect all of the dots and see how clearly we could have saved \nthe day, had we connected the dots.\n    So I suppose I had more of a statement than questions for \nyou, because I just absolutely believe that we must not allow \nourselves to be trapped by religion and by ethnicity and place \nof origin. It is bigger than that.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n    Chairman Thompson. Thank you very much.\n    The gentleman's time has expired.\n    The gentleman from California for 5 minutes, Mr. Lungren.\n    Mr. Lungren. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I \nappreciate the time. I am sorry I couldn't be here during all \nof this, but I am divided between three different committees, \nand we just voted to impeach a Federal judge. I think it is \nonly eight times in history we have done that, so I had to be \nthere for that vote.\n    Yes, I hope we are not prisoners of wrong impressions \neither. But I also hope we are not prisoners of PC. We are in a \nwar declared on us by radical jihad, radical Islam. That \nhappens to be a fact. We didn't pick the war. They picked the \nwar. I haven't seen too many Irish Catholic nuns blow \nthemselves up.\n    Sometimes we do stupid things like having my 6-month-old \ngranddaughter a couple of years ago taken out for a secondary \nsearch when they searched her diaper. That kind of stupidity \nhurts us, I think, even though we do it to make sure that we \nhave some egalitarian approach to this.\n    Mr. Kennedy, let me ask you something. That is if the State \nDepartment had the information about Abdulmutallab from his \nfather prior to issuing a visa, would we have issued a visa?\n    Mr. Kennedy. Sir, if we had the information the father had \npresented before----\n    Mr. Lungren. Yes, that is my question.\n    Mr. Kennedy. Yes, sir. What we would have done is we would \nhave not issued the visa. We would have sent in to the \nintelligence and law enforcement communities a security and \nadvisory opinion, ask them what additional information they \nhad, and then made the decision on the basis of what additional \ninformation they provided as well.\n    Mr. Lungren. So if that is the case, why wouldn't we move \nto revoke the visa if we have that information?\n    Mr. Kennedy. Because we sent the request in to the Visas \nViper, sir, went into the intelligence and law enforcement \ncommunity and ask them if they had any additional information \non Mr. Mutallab.\n    Mr. Lungren. Does someone have a constitutional right to \ncome to the United States?\n    Mr. Kennedy. No, sir.\n    Mr. Lungren. Does someone have some sort of international \nright to come to the United States?\n    Mr. Kennedy. Absolutely not.\n    Mr. Lungren. A visa is a discretionary action by the United \nStates, right?\n    Mr. Kennedy. Absolutely, sir.\n    Mr. Lungren. The granting of a visa. So why would you even \nhesitate about not granting someone a visa if he had that \ninformation from the father such as was given by Mr. \nAbdulmutallab's father?\n    Mr. Kennedy. Two reasons, sir. First is context. We turn \ndown almost two million--1.9 million visas a year. So we do \nnot----\n    Mr. Lungren. Okay. I don't care about the other. I am \nasking you about this specific case. That is why I am asking.\n    Mr. Kennedy. No, because, sir, there are people who come \ninto embassies every day, every month, family members, \ndisgruntled business partners, and others who say that so-and-\nso might be a terrorist. So we have been very carefully \nanalyzing that. We consult with our partners.\n    Mr. Lungren. Okay. I understand that. Let me ask you this, \nthen. So do we have a lot of fathers who have experience such \nas Mr. Abdulmutallab's father did, who turn their sons in with \nthat kind of information?\n    Mr. Kennedy. There have been family members.\n    Mr. Lungren. So there are a lot of them.\n    Mr. Kennedy. There have been family members who----\n    Mr. Lungren. You know, I appreciate it. I don't like people \ngetting cute with me. This is very serious business.\n    Mr. Kennedy. Absolutely.\n    Mr. Lungren. The American people are asking us. I was just \nhome. People are saying, ``How in God's name can you screw up \nlike this?'' We have spent billions of dollars trying to do it, \nand we say, ``Well, you know, a father comes in like this with \nthis guy's pedigree. He says that about it. Yes, we got a lot \nof them.'' I would argue that you don't get a lot of them, and \nI would argue that you ought to be a little more serious about \nthis then doing that.\n    Mr. Kennedy. Sir, I am----\n    Mr. Lungren. Now, you know, it is easy to be a second, you \nknow, on Monday morning quarterback, but when you tell me that, \nit bothers me a great deal.\n    Mr. Kennedy. If I could just finish my sentence.\n    Mr. Lungren. You can finish your sentence, but we are in a \nserious question here about people who want to kill us, and you \ntalk to me. It sounds like the State Department is doing things \nthe way they used to do it.\n    Mr. Kennedy. No, sir. The second part of my sentence, sir, \nis that we are reviewing all of our procedures. We regard \nourselves as the first line of defense, and we have every \nintention. We are committed to----\n    Mr. Lungren. Well, you weren't the first line of defense \nhere, were you?\n    Mr. Kennedy. I believe we were, sir.\n    Mr. Lungren. This is amazing. I am sorry. It is amazing to \nme. So you don't--it didn't work the way it should, though, did \nit?\n    Mr. Kennedy. Absolutely not.\n    Mr. Lungren. Okay.\n    Mr. Kennedy. I said that in my testimony, sir.\n    Mr. Lungren. So you are reviewing the procedures and \ncriteria. So what would do differently now, if you got this \ninformation? Or would you do anything differently, except make \nsure it went up the line?\n    Mr. Kennedy. If he had been a visa applicant, we would have \ncoded that information. We would have sent the inquiry to \nWashington. We would have asked other people in the \nintelligence community what----\n    Mr. Lungren. Okay. So he wasn't a visa applicant. He \nalready had a visa.\n    Mr. Kennedy. Right.\n    Mr. Lungren. So what change would take place now, if you \nare confronted with the same information, not applying for a \nvisa, but he has a visa. This information is brought to you at \none of the embassies.\n    Mr. Kennedy. I would think, as you suggested, sir, we would \ndo all more in-depth review to make sure that the information \nbeing presented to us was valid. Then if it was valid, we would \nmove to revoke the visa immediately.\n    Mr. Lungren. Okay. I would just like you to bring one \nlittle bit of information back to the State Department. I have \nan adult daughter who was visiting Gambia the week after \nChristmas. She thought it might be important for her to go to \nthe embassy to indicate that she was there--American citizen \nthere.\n    She was told the person that would take that information \nwas sick, and the person who was--or, excuse me, was on \nvacation--and the person who was supposed to take that person's \nplace was sick. Therefore, she could come back in a week to \ntell them that she was there. She was leaving in a week.\n    I just want to tell you she didn't pull anything about \nbeing my daughter or anything else. I just happen to think that \nkind of a response to a simple American citizen going to a \ncountry saying, ``You know, you might want to know I am here in \ncase anything happens''--not that she thought anything was \ngoing to happen in that country, but that was the response she \ngot.\n    Mr. Kennedy. That was totally inappropriate and wrong, and \nI will look into that, sir. We encourage, we request, we have \nweb sites to encourage any American traveler to record their--\n--\n    Mr. Lungren. That is what she did. She was told to come \nback after she had left.\n    Mr. Kennedy. That was an error, and we will look into it. \nWhy? That is not our procedure.\n    Chairman Thompson. The gentleman's time has expired.\n    The gentlelady from Texas for 5 minutes, Ms. Jackson Lee.\n    Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n    To the witnesses, let me thank you.\n    I think all of us echo the fact that we know that there are \nmen and women on the front line, and we appreciate their \nservice. We also appreciate the leadership of the President of \nthe United States as the Commander-in-Chief. He should be able \nto expect the highest level of performance of his staff, of his \nExecutive staff, that he should also expect the Congress is a \ncollaborator with him in team homeland security.\n    Unfortunately, I think that there were enormous challenges \nand missteps that did not equate to the team working together \nand playing on the playing field together. I frankly believe \nthat part of it is, of course, some of the missteps of the \nUnited States Congress, some of the inability of the executive \nto listen to the Congress.\n    My subcommittee, the Subcommittee on Transportation \nSecurity and Infrastructure Protection, looked into the \nquestion of watch lists. We actually made comments about the \nburdensome method of that watch list, of how heavy laden it \nwas, how inaccurate it was, to the extent that we had 8-year-\nolds, so we had an 8-year-old as a witness. Another 8-year-old \nhad been interviewed. It is a simple task to look at that watch \nlist and provide the intelligence and the staffing to make it a \nwatch list that is credible of the name.\n    The other broken part of the system is the responsibility \nstill, as I understand it, on airline personnel as people come \nto counters and their names--they go to the back and check \ntheir names--civilians looking at issues that happen to deal \nwith homeland security issues.\n    We have a problem and a crisis that needs to be fixed. A \npart of it is that we must acknowledge that we will not have \npeople bearing flags running down airports and saying, ``I am a \nterrorist.'' Individual operators and actors, franchising of \nterrorism, seems to be the call of the day, and then taking \ncredit for it one way or the other. We know now that Osama bin \nLaden has taken credit for the December 25 action.\n    Many of us, who are not inside the Department, were aware \nthat there was activity going on around the holiday. We know \nthat that is the modus operandi of terrorists. Go when a \ncountry is focusing on something else. So my questions go to \nthis whole question of interrelatedness.\n    Quickly to Secretary Kennedy, are your consul offices--do \nthey have a direct connection to the watch list effort of \nDeputy Secretary Lute and the counterterrorism efforts of \nDirector Leiter so that the Nigerian consulate person would \nhave had that direct connection?\n    Chairman Thompson. Please use your microphone.\n    Mr. Kennedy. My apologies.\n    We get daily and----\n    Ms. Jackson Lee. Can they call back and contact a human \nbeing?\n    Chairman Thompson. Madam, well, just, I don't think he \nfinished it.\n    Ms. Jackson Lee. I understand, but my question is can \nthey--I hear what he is going to say. The question is----\n    Chairman Thompson. Now, I didn't hear what he was going to \nsay. Just let him answer. You have got plenty of time. I am \ngoing to be very nice.\n    Go ahead, Mr. Kennedy.\n    Mr. Kennedy. The law enforcement and Homeland Security and \nintelligence communities provide us with information every day \non new threats. We load that into our database, and that \ninformation is available to every embassy and consulate \nthroughout the world.\n    Ms. Jackson Lee. Does the consular general have the \nauthority or the ability, or the individual who dealt with the \nfather of the alleged perpetrator in the incident at December \n25, to be able to call back on the telephone, on a cable, on an \ne-mail, or whatever is secure, to ask questions out of the \nDeputy Secretary Lute area or the counterterrorism area?\n    Mr. Kennedy. What they do is they call the visa office at \nthe State Department, which is our central repository and which \nis in daily contact via all the secure means with both as the \nNational Counterterrorism Center, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center. Yes, ma'am. We \nare in contact with daily. That is one of the major \nimprovements since 9/11. We are all lashed up as partners----\n    Ms. Jackson Lee. But if you are in contact, what does that \nmean? Does that mean that the person who engaged with the \nfather of the alleged perpetrator had the ability to get on the \nphone and call and get a quick answer of the person who \nanswered the phone in Washington, DC? I am suspicious. There is \nan individual here talking about activity of an individual that \nhas a visa.\n    Was there a direct link for there to be a response by \nchecking live intelligence by way of a direct call to the \ncounterterrorism or direct call to the watch list? Those are in \ntwo different areas.\n    Mr. Kennedy. Yes, sir. He was not on the watch list. He was \nnot on the Selectee list. The State Department, when the father \ncame in, talked to an embassy officer, who then immediately \nreported to the consular section that this is the information \nthat was received, and that information was immediately sent to \nWashington.\n    Ms. Jackson Lee. Have you made changes to ensure that \ninformation that would describe someone as suspicious can be \nresponded to quickly? Because frankly I believe that all that \nthe father said was enough information for a well-trained \nofficial, whether they are State Department or not, that we are \nliving in a different climate and maybe I should do something \nabout it? Have you had a re-training of your staff around the \ncountry--around the world, rather?\n    Mr. Kennedy. Yes, ma'am. We have sent out revised and \nupdated instructions, and we emphasize that we have added \nadditional information to the immediate report that is sent \nin--it is called Visas Viper--that notifies the Homeland \nSecurity and intelligence and law enforcement communities that \nthe State Department has come into piece of information that \nmay well be important, and here it is.\n    Ms. Jackson Lee. Deputy Secretary Lute, if I might, on the \nwatch list, which has been one of the major complaints and a \nburdensome list that is both, I believe, inaccurate. In many \ninstances it plays into my colleague's comments about profiling \nfor the basis of religion and otherwise, which does nothing to \nfight the war on terror.\n    My question is the distinction between the watch list and \nthe No-Fly list. In this instance this person should have \ndefinitely been on the No-Fly list, and so my question is what \nis the strategy for a comprehensive and coordinated \nwatchlisting and screening approach into a prioritized \nimplementation and investment plan that describes the scope, \ngovernance principles, outcomes, milestones, training \nobjectives, metrics, cost and schedule of necessary activities \nas relates to the watch list to be able to move to the No-Fly \nlist?\n    If I may also raise to Director Leiter so I can have these \nquestions out, which I think is very important. I hope that \nwhen we are on notice that an incident is occurring, all hands \nwill be on deck, similar to making sure that embassy personnel, \nwho we have great respect for, are at their desks at \nappropriate times, because all times of the schedule, if you \nwill, the calendar, people are coming and going. I hope if \nthere is a terrorist act, we have all hands on deck on this \ninformation.\n    Director Leiter, and I would say my question is there has \nbeen a lot of discussion about the failure. This was not a \nfailure to connect the dots, but to analyze what we had. It has \nbeen said that the intelligence community, to build a more \nrobust analytical capability, specifically what steps are being \ntaken to accommodate this goal in training, system design and \ntechnological changes, but more importantly, on the human \nintelligence and behavioral assessment, which, if you had done \nthat on the gentleman's actions, he would have been on the No-\nFly list.\n    Deputy Secretary Lute.\n    Ms. Lute. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. As you know, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security does not own or control the \nwatchlisting. Abdulmutallab was neither No-Fly nor Selectee.\n    But we are working very closely with our colleagues \nthroughout the interagency to identify the kinds of information \nthat is necessary for us to take steps related to ensuring \naviation security.\n    In fact, in the wake of this incident, we will take \ninformation such as Under Secretary Kennedy was talking about \nand put that in the hand of our immigration advisory \nprofessionals that are stationed abroad in nine locations so \nthat they can engage in additional questioning and examination \nof persons who come on that list. That is an important step in \nthe direction of increased security, and we are looking at \nothers as well.\n    You also mentioned the frustration with the ensuring the \naccuracy of the list. We share that frustration. It is \nimportant that we do have lists on which we rely for ensuring \nthe safety of the traveling public, that these be accurate \nlists. We are working very intensively to establish an easy way \nfor people to de-conflict information when it is erroneous and \nto ensure that those lists are the accurate, important tool \nthat we need them to be.\n    But we also know that we are facing a determined adversary, \nwho is looking to use people who are unknown to any system. In \nthis regard we need to evaluate their activities, travel \npatterns, and other activities which can tip us off that this \nperson may be dangerous, certainly is worth additional \nscreening and questioning, and working intensively with our \ninteragency colleagues to get better systems in place for those \ncontingencies.\n    Mr. Leiter. Congresswoman, thank you for the question. I \nthink you are exactly right, that we have to improve the \nability of these analysts to understand the characteristics of \nthis information as they are coming in so they get a true feel \nfor when a father walks in, why is the father walking in? Why \nthis report?\n    We are doing a number of things on this front. Most \nimportantly, we are creating specific teams that are not bound \nto writing daily intelligence. When they get that bit from the \nfather and dive into it and connect that intelligence in a way, \nthat you do have all the information necessary to make that \ndetermination about whether someone should be or should not be \non the No-Fly list.\n    So you also do not get people on the No-Fly list that you \ndon't want on the No-Fly list, because the only way you are \ngoing to get the bad guys off the plane is to also ensure that \nthe good guys can get on the plane. Otherwise, the system just \nbecomes unwieldy.\n    So we have already begun additional training. The Director \nof National Intelligence is studying how we can advance that \ntraining more. We are creating teams to pursue these to ensure \nthat they have the time and they have the resources to track \ndown these free pieces of information and put them together.\n    Mr. Kennedy. Congresswoman, you also asked is the State \nDepartment on duty in addition to the embassy people you \nmentioned. We have somebody responsible that is in our \noperation centers 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, 365 days a \nyear. If a question comes in from an embassy--it may be in a \ndifferent time zone--or comes in from our partners in the \nNational security community, that officer knows who to reach \nout to to get the right information they need immediately.\n    Ms. Jackson Lee. Mr. Chairman, may I just say a point on \nthe record?\n    I thank the witnesses.\n    The one point that I heard Deputy Secretary Lute say is \nthat Homeland Security does not have ownership of the watch \nlist. I think it speaks to, again, the work we have to do and \nhave been doing to get the synergism so that we have some \nmutually interrelatedness on trying to help all of these \npersons and that we can get an understanding everybody has \nownership of the watch list, the No-Fly list.\n    We have got to find a way to weave in our security so that \nthere are no gaps, not putting the fault on these public \nservants, but there has to be a cleaning up of the cracks in \nthe system that will allow this kind of breach to happen. It \nhas to be a combination, Mr. Chairman, of the Executive working \nwith us as team homeland security, and no distinction between \nRepublicans and Democrats, team homeland security.\n    I hope in that spirit that we will have the appointee \nnecessary for the running of the Homeland Security Department \nto move as quickly as possible to be appointed and confirmed on \nthe behalf of the American people. I look forward to working \nwith them.\n    I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding.\n    Chairman Thompson. Thank you very much.\n    I want to thank the witnesses for their valuable testimony \nand the Members for their questions.\n    Mr. Kennedy, if you would provide the committee with the \ninstructions you referenced Chairwoman Jackson Lee that have \nbeen implemented since the December 25 incident with respect to \ntraining and other information. Now, if that is classified, \njust let us know, we will still govern ourselves accordingly.\n    Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Chairman, I will be pleased to get that to \nyou, sir. Thank you.\n    Chairman Thompson. Thank you.\n    Mr. Leiter, you said you want to make sure that good guys \nget on the plane. There is a good guy here who is a Member of \nCongress that has an awful difficult time getting on planes. He \nis Congressman John Lewis in Georgia.\n    Deputy Secretary Lute, can you look into that and figure \nout a way how he can not be flagged for secondary screening and \nother things, because he is in fact John Lewis? Now, there is \nanother John Lewis out there. We still ought to have a system \nto figure out how to handle this.\n    Ms. Lute. Yes, sir, we should. I am on it.\n    Chairman Thompson. Okay. Thank you very much. I am sure he \nwould appreciate it.\n    Mr. Leiter. Mr. Chairman. Can I make one note on that \nfront?\n    Chairman Thompson. Yes.\n    Mr. Leiter. Not knowing the facts of Congressman Lewis' \ncase and certainly not accusing him of being a known or \nsuspected terrorist, I do want to flag for the committee--I \nthink it is important to understand--that a desire to have more \npeople on the watch list will inevitably lead to more false \npositives. We have to accept that, I believe, as a cost.\n    There is nothing we can do technologically or with the \nhuman to eliminate those false positives from occurring--again, \nnot speaking directly to the Congressman's case, but accepting \nthat this will be a byproduct of ensuring that some bad people \ndon't get on the plane.\n    Chairman Thompson. Well, and I understand, but that is \ngoing forward. This has been from day 1. So we are not even to \nthe next generation. But, obviously, we assume the \ninconvenience that adding to the list will bring, but these are \ndifferent times.\n    Mr. Kennedy, last question. Can you provide the committee \nwith either, if you know right now or at a later date, how many \npeople we actually have working in the visa office in your shop \nhere in Washington?\n    Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Chairman, let me get that for the record. \nI can get within a swag, but I will submit that for the record, \nsir.\n    Chairman Thompson. Thank you very much.\n    Mr. King. Thank you for the testimony. Thank you for their \nservice. I yield back.\n    Thank you, Chairman, for the hearing.\n    Chairman Thompson. Thank you.\n    Before concluding, I remind the witnesses that the Members \nof the committee may have additional questions for you, and we \nask that you respond expeditiously in writing to those \nquestions.\n    Hearing no further business, the committee stands \nadjourned."

"","","leiter","Michael E. Leiter","  Questions From Honorable Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas for Jane Holl \n        Lute, Deputy Secretary, Department of Homeland Security\n    Question 1. In response to a recommendation by the 9/11 Commission \nabout improving passenger pre-screening, the Secure Flight program is \nbeing implemented so that TSA will be assuming the duty, which now \nrests with the air carriers, of checking passengers against the No-Fly \nand Selectee databases. I understand TSA is first implementing Secure \nFlight domestically, but with there being a significant threat \nconcerning international in-bound flights, how will the Department \nconduct watch list passenger pre-screening for in-bound flights to the \nUnited States? How will this be incorporated with existing CBP programs \nlike the Advanced Passenger Information System?\n    Answer. DHS is implementing Secure Flight through a phased process. \nThe Transportation Security Administration (TSA) anticipates that \nSecure Flight deployments for domestic aircraft operators will be \ncompleted in spring 2010. TSA has also initiated Secure Flight \ndeployments for foreign aircraft operators and expects to assume watch \nlist matching for all flights, international and domestic, by the end \nof calendar year 2010.\n    All aircraft operators, both foreign and domestic, who have not \ntransitioned to Secure Flight are responsible for conducting watch list \nscreening of their passengers against the No-Fly and Selectee lists.\n    Currently, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) screens \ntravelers arriving into or departing from the United States against the \nTerrorist Screening Database (TSDB, the U.S. Government's Terrorist \nWatch List), including No-Fly and Selectee records. All commercial and \nprivate aircraft operators with flights arriving into or departing from \nthe United States are required to transmit passenger manifest \ninformation through the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS) to \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). APIS is used for terrorist \nwatchlist screening, law enforcement analytical work, passenger \nfacilitation, and departure monitoring. As part of program alignment, \non February 19, 2008, CBP started screening all APIS manifest \nsubmissions against the No-Fly and Selectee watch lists with the \nscreening results being provided to the TSA Office of Intelligence \n(TSA-OI) for resolution. CBP has been working closely with TSA and the \nairline industry to align the APIS program with TSA Secure Flight \nwatchlist screening. When TSA's Secure Flight Program is fully \nimplemented, the No-Fly and Selectee screening will transition from the \nAPIS system to Secure Flight. CBP will continue to process APIS \nmanifest information for its law enforcement and traveler facilitation \nmission.\n    Question 2. Ms. Lute, It is my understanding that ``Puffer \nMachines'' or Explosive Trace Portal Machines worked great when they \nwere tested in the lab testing but during field testing they had a high \nbreakdown rate caused by dust and dirt entering the machines. I have \nbeen told by TSA that there are currently 9 machines currently in the \nfield, but TSA has no intention to field any more because of the \nbreakdown rate. Is any effort being made to revise or improve this \ntechnology?\n    Answer. At this time there are only two deployed Explosive Trace \nPortals (ETP), one at Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport and one at \nPhoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, and both are slotted for \nremoval this year. As we deploy Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) at an \nairport we remove obsolete equipment at the same time. This minimizes \ndisruption of the airport operations and increases resource and cost \nefficiencies.\n    While the ETP devices previously purchased by Transportation \nSecurity Administration (TSA) experienced operational performance \nissues that hindered their effectiveness in the field, TSA and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate \ncontinue to evaluate a variety of trace detection technologies.\n    Question 3. Ms. Lute, it is my understanding that every checkpoint \nin the United States has portable Explosive Trace Technology devices. I \nrealize it is not practical to test every person in every airport with \nthis device because of time limitations, but can TSA increase the \namount of passengers randomly selected for the explosive trace \ntechnology swab test? Has TSA taken any steps to increase their use?\n    Answer. To restate your question more accurately, every checkpoint \nin the United States has tabletop Explosive Trace Technology devices. \nExplosive Trace Detection (ETD) technology is a critical tool in our \nability to stay ahead of evolving threats to aviation security. In \nfact, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has recently \nexpanded the random use of ETD technology at airports Nation-wide as an \nadditional layer of security. Since it will be used on a random basis, \npassengers should not expect to see the same thing at every airport or \neach time they travel. TSA will continue to evaluate the numbers of \npassengers screened and work to maximize the effectiveness of ETD \nscreening as commensurate with resource levels and airport operations.\n    Question 4. Ms. Lute, it is my understanding that a pilot program \nthat was recently completed by TSA called ``e-Logbook'' would allow TSA \nto instantly be able to know if a FAM or LEO flying armed is on-board \nan aircraft. I have been informed this pilot program was a success \nhowever, it is my understanding that no funding has been requested yet \nfor this program to go up Nation-wide. I would like to know what the \ncurrent status is and what plan does TSA have to role out this program \nNation-wide?\n    Answer. The Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) has a dedicated \nsystem in place to continually track, in real time, Federal Air Marshal \n(FAM) presence on domestic and international flights.\n    With regard to the Electronic Logbook (e-Logbook) pilot program, \nthe Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is seeking to \nestablish an automated process for providing situational awareness for \nother armed law enforcement officers (LEOs) on-board any given \naircraft. The e-Logbook pilot program was tested in Washington (Reagan \nNational Airport, Dulles International) and San Francisco and TSA is \ncurrently considering a Nation-wide implementation. In the interim, \nTSA's Transportation Security Operations Center (TSOC) currently tracks \nState and local armed LEOs on commercial aircraft through a National \nLaw Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS) solution implemented \nlast year. Although functional, the NLETS solution relies on manual \nprocesses and is limited to State and local LEOs.\n    Also, on February 1, 2010, TSA began a pilot implementation of an \nenhanced credential verification procedure for Federal Law Enforcement \npersonnel flying while armed.\n    The enhanced identification procedures require each Federal LEO \nflying armed in accordance with 49 C.F.R. \u0006 1544.219 and respective \nagency policy, to be in possession of a Unique Federal Agency Number \n(UFAN). The UFAN is an agency-specific alpha-numeric number TSA issues \nto Federal agencies/entities upon request. The UFAN is known only to \nTSA and the respective agency/entity. Each agency/entity must ensure \nits eligible law enforcement personnel are aware of this number to be \nused in conjunction with the LEOs badge, credential, a secondary form \nof Government-issued identification, and airline-issued LEO flying \narmed paperwork. The UFAN number is an additional form of verification \nand will be requested of the LEO at the LEO checkpoint prior to entry \ninto the boarding area.\n    Question 5. Ms. Lute, it has come to my intention that some flights \nhave both FAMS agents and LEO's flying armed, while other flights have \nneither. Is the Department taking any steps to create a scheduling \nsystem to maximize the use of FAMS with LEO's flying armed?\n    Answer. The Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) provides mission \ncoverage to the Nation's civil aviation system using a concept of \noperations (CONOPs) that is essentially a threat-based matrix \nprioritizing scheduled flight coverage well in advance of the flight \ndate. FAMS, on the other hand, can be made available to cover emergent \nthreats when necessary. In order to perform the FAMS' mission, all \nFederal Air Marshals (FAM) undergo intensive specialized training far \nexceeding requirements for law enforcement officers (LEOs) flying \narmed.\n    With regard to the matter of other armed LEOs, the FAMS has \ndetermined that flight schedules from other agencies (Federal, State, \nand local) are flexible by nature, often booked within days of the \nflight date (allowing virtually no advance FAMS planning) and are not \nsufficiently reliable to ensure daily coverage of flights. \nOverburdening airlines and TSA's Mission Operation Center with \nadditional last moment cancellations/bookings to ensure proper coverage \nof high priority flights presents operational and logistical challenges \nbest overcome by the FAMS making its own schedule independent of other \nLEOs traveling on flights.\n    Question 6. Ms. Lute, does the Department plan to hire more FAMS \nagents? If so, how many?\n    Answer. The President's fiscal year 2011 budget request does seek \nto increase the Federal Air Marshal Service funded staffing level. \nSpecifically, the budget request seeks to hire 499 additional FAMS \npersonnel in fiscal year 2011.\n    Question 7. I have recently become aware of ``event-driven'' as \ncompared to ``person-driven'' software. As I understand it, ``event-\ndriven'' software is very efficient and can instantly capture and \nprocess extremely large volumes of information. I understand that \nelectronic signals generated by events serve as input into specialized \nevent-driven software. I am told that based on its processing rules \nwith predetermined expectations and constraints, it can intelligently \nprocess the information to constantly revaluate individuals' risk \nprofiles, connect the intelligence-revealing dots, and automatically \nand immediately communicate the derived intelligence or alerts to all \nthe appropriate people that need to know, or need to take action.\n    I am told that this event-driven software has been successfully \nused for years in extremely complex manufacturing environments such as \nAerospace and Defense, as well as many other challenging industries. \nThe processing of travel and security ``events'' is apparently no \ndifferent and I understand that the software can be deployed very \nquickly. It appears there is a possibility that with this software the \n``events'' leading up to the Christmas day bomber incident would have \nset off the alarms for everyone, even if the bomber was not on any \nwatch list. How long do you estimate it will take before the American \npeople can be protected by comprehensive ``event-driven'' software?\n    Answer. DHS is aware that event-driven systems have proven useful \nin such large-scale applications as manufacturing, financial and \ninvestment management, aircraft and spaceflight, and project \nmanagement. Common to all these applications is some on-going process, \nworkflow, or lifecycle. For example, a production line; an investment \npolicy based on a series of price or monetary changes; a series of \nengine thrust, altitude, heading, weather, and fuel (and many other) \nmeasurements, which describe the health of an aircraft; or a \ndevelopment cycle for a software design. The ``event'' refers to a \npoint along the process, workflow, or lifecycle, where an automated \ndecision is made by the system to proceed or to take one of several \nalternatives. Using our manufacturing or aircraft and spaceflight \nexamples, this could be deciding to insert a new throttle assembly \nbecause the old one was ineffective or setting a series of thrusters or \nmaking altitude adjustments on the Space Shuttle to ensure a safe re-\nentry trajectory. For event-driven systems to function, at least three \nelements are necessary. These are: (1) A constrained set of rules that \ndetermine how decisions are made, (2) access to all the data or \ndatabases that are necessary to make a decision, and (3) sensors to \ndetect an event or measurements that are continuously made along the \nprocess or lifecycle.\n    In the context of the attempted attack on December 25, 2009, for an \nindividual and an explosive material, a set of rules does exist for \ndeciding what happens if one or the other is detected, therefore the \nfirst element for an event-driven system is present and functioning. \nThe second element, access to all data, was incomplete. In the case of \nthe individual, while he used his real identity (e.g., he did not try \nto use a false passport or another name), DHS screening systems lacked \nany data indicating that he presented an imminent threat. In \nparticular, he was not on the U.S. Government's terrorist watch list.\n    Similarly, while DHS had sufficient information to know that the \nparticular substance could be explosive, our foreign partners did not \nhave systems or processes in place to detect it.\n    In summary, an event-driven system applied to the attempted attack \non December 25 would not have functioned because the individual was not \nwatchlisted and because the screening equipment was not sensitive \nenough to detect the explosive material. Had the individual been \nwatchlisted or had the equipment been sensitive enough to detect the \nexplosive materials, an event-driven system would not have been \nnecessary as the existing information-based and physical screening \nprocesses would have prevented him from boarding the aircraft. DHS is \nworking with our counterparts within the U.S. Government and our \nforeign partners to close these vulnerabilities.\n    Event-driven systems could prove useful for some homeland security \napplications. However, should the Department identify event-driven \nsystems as a practical technology solution for air passenger screening, \nit will take time to integrate into the existing enterprise.\n    Question 8. The findings of the administration's report released \nJan 7, 2010, included: ``The information that was available to \nanalysts, as is usually the case, was fragmented and embedded in a \nlarge volume of other data'', and that ``NCTC and CIA personnel who are \nresponsible for watchlisting did not search all available databases to \nuncover additional derogatory information that could have been \ncorrelated with Mr. Abdulmutallab''.\n    My understanding is that most of the analysis is currently a \nprocess of manual searches of the various databases.\n    Could this goal be achieved with automation, through the use of \nclever technology that can process large volumes of information \nefficiently and if so, are you currently looking at putting such \ntechnology in place?\n    Answer. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is investigating \nways to improve searches across the large number of databases in the \nDepartment. Even before 25 December, in response to terrorist activity, \nthe Department established a DHS Threat Task Force (DTTF) and provided \naccess to 47 databases to a single co-located team in order to conduct \nname traces. While this is a step forward and has yielded actionable \ninsights, the greater need is the ability to search across databases at \nthe same time, combining search results. Rather than search each \ndatabase individually, a federated search would allow us to more \nquickly make analytic connections.\n    A cross-database search capability could enable DHS to conduct \nsearches on individual names, submit lists of names for search, and set \nup alerts which are tripped when new information on individuals of \ninterest arrives. Various statistical and probabilistic algorithms \ncould be used to prioritize the search results based on context and \nfrequency.\n    DHS is exploring options for a federated search capability. While \nfederating searches across multiple databases is technically feasible, \nit is challenging when dealing with numerous datasets of different eras \nand structures, and it must also be done in a manner consistent with \nDHS information use policies including implementation of the Fair \nInformation Practice Principles. In advance of creating this \ncapability, moreover, the Department will also develop applicable \nSystem of Records Notices (SORN) and Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) \nto ensure that we use the databases in a manner consistent with what we \nhave publicly stated about them. The Department will continue to work \nthrough these issues to make available for search the kinds of \nsensitive U.S. persons data that are currently not easily shared with \nthe intelligence community in a manner that protects privacy, civil \nrights and civil liberties, and ensuring DHS can achieve its mission to \ndetect threats to the homeland.\n    Question 9. Does our technology today enable us to assess every \nsingle passenger's risk profile, considering all contributing factors, \nin order to determine his/her specific risk level at any given point in \ntime, and to immediately communicate an elevated risk to the security \nagencies for extra screening or follow up? If not, are you aware of a \ntechnology that could accomplish this?\n    Answer. For international flights, in addition to screening against \nthe No-Fly and Selectee lists that are part of the Terrorist Screening \nDatabase, DHS uses a decisions support tool that compares traveler \ninformation against intelligence and other enforcement data by \nincorporating risk-based targeting scenarios and assessments. The \nprimary purpose is to target, identify, and prevent terrorists and \nterrorists' weapons from entering the country. All individuals entering \nthe country by commercial air and sea carriers are run through this \nsystem. Based on results of the targeting systems, DHS will determine \nappropriate next steps, which include denying boarding, additional \nscreening before departure or upon arrival, denying admission to the \nUnited States, or arrest upon arrival.\n Questions From Chairman Bennie G. Thompson of Mississippi for Michael \n         E. Leiter, Director, National Counterterrorism Center\n    Question 1. What disciplinary or other personnel action has your \nagency taken in response to the events leading up to the failed attack \non Flight 253?\n    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.\n    Question 2. Does NCTC have the authority it needs to fulfill its \nmission to the American people? Specify any additional authorities \nneeded to operate effectively.\n    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.\n    Question 3. Under what circumstances are names removed from the \nTIDE database? Describe relevant procedures and the time intervals \nassociated with these procedures.\n    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.\n   Question From Honorable Christopher P. Carney of Pennsylvania for \n     Michael E. Leiter, Director, National Counterterrorism Center\n    Question. Mr. Leiter, at the hearing when asked about how many \npoints of failure occurred within our intelligence and homeland \nsecurity systems, ``Was there a single point of failure, a double point \nof failure or multiple points of failure?'', you answered ``Multiple''. \nPlease list these failures and rank them in terms of severity and what \nneeds to be done to fix them.\n    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication."
