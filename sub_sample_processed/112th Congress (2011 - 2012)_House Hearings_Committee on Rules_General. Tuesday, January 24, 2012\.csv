"dreier","Mr. Dreier","","","    Very sad.\n    The Chairman. I also want to thank the young chairman of \nthe Rules Committee, David Dreier, who is an energetic \nproponent for biennial budgeting and is a sponsor, the lead \nsponsor of this measure that we are considering today. And I \nthink that as we hear from David and others on this panel, we \nwill see where this is an idea that not only has great merit \nbut one which we should be moving forthrightly through this \nCongress.\n    This hearing before the Subcommittee on Legislative and \nBudget Process will examine H.R. 114, the Biennial Budgeting \nand Appropriations Act of 2011. Biennial budgeting has been a \ntopic of reform since 1977 in the United States, and we will \nsee the interest that surrounds that and the ideas which I \nbelieve today make it very important for us to discuss for not \nonly the success of our budgeting process but the success of \nthe American people. Perhaps John Adams may have exaggerated a \nbit when he said, and I quote, ``But when progress has been \nmade, it has been because policymakers have absorbed lessons \nfrom past experience and applied them in ways that have \nimproved our processes for governance.''\n    Ladies and gentlemen, that is a good quote, and we should \nlearn from not only the past but also good ideas for the \nfuture. The budget process can be an effective tool and in fact \nshould be done more effectively. But, as we see, biennial \nbudgeting alleviates, I think, the burden that this Congress \nfaces every year to beat multiple deadlines in both the budget \nand appropriations processes. That is the question and the \ntest: Can we make both of these processes work to better our \ncircumstances?\n    So the hearing today is going to examine that question. We \nhave several distinguished Members of Congress, and obviously \noutside witnesses, who would choose to make comments and \nprovide us with policy aspects for this important issue. This \nhearing is not intended for the analysis of budget specifics, \nfunding initiatives or priorities, but, rather, to step back \nand to look at the budget process and to look at recent \ninteraction between the houses of Congress with the executive \nbranch and to find out where we can be more effective in this \nprocess.\n    Most of us who are sitting on the dais or testifying this \nmorning have a fairly established belief that biennial \nbudgeting will or could be seen as a useful tool. I don't know \nwhether our fiscal house would be better or worse by its use, \nbut we want to examine that. But I do know that today marks the \n1000th day since the Democratic-controlled Senate has passed a \nbudget, meaning it is a tough process, and meanwhile Congress \nhas failed to pass appropriations bills in a timely manner \nsince fiscal year 1997, which was 15 years ago. Once again, \nthat tells you how difficult the process is.\n    Are we at a point where the consensus of this legislative \nbody is where we no longer should make hard choices to support \nthe fiscal health of this Nation? That is a good question. And, \nobviously, if the process has not worked for 15 years, it is a \nquestion that we should answer. I think we do need to look at \nthe process and make the hard choices to ensure that our \ngovernment works properly.\n    Do we employ further reforms such as biennial budgeting in \nan effort to reverse the course of the last 1000 days? I would \nsay we should build in some process that works well and that \nthe American people can count on, as well as the two bodies as \nwe move forward.\n    I understand all too well the need for ideological \nattentiveness. I do understand that we have and see things from \ndifferent lenses and different angles, but at least the current \nHouse leadership has put forward ideas allowing for a \ndeliberative process.\n    On January 17th of this new year, Majority Leader Harry \nReid's deputy chief of staff and policy director all but \nadmitted that Senate Democrats would again not even begin the \nwork on a budget in the Senate. I think that is a betrayal of \ncongressional process. I believe we need a clear record that \nthe American people can have confidence in and that both bodies \nshould find a way to work together through proper planning.\n    Most importantly, we must become more efficient as a \ngovernment. And I am a cosponsor of H.R. 114 because I believe \nthat utilizing the same long-term planning, just as I did in \nthe private sector for 16 years, allows us to prepare more \neffectively for the future. If we intend for government to be \neffective and efficient, we need to give them not just the \ntools, but the money and the authority to work properly.\n    The Congress cannot direct this country on a day-to-day or \nmonth-to-month existence, focusing not on the best fiscal \npractices, but really just on the short-term needs of the two \nparties. Longer Federal contracts provide the best opportunity \nto save taxpayers' dollars and dedicating more time to \noversight. However, we have effective people in our government \nwho can manage their business. We need to give them the tools \nwhere they can do that and make long-term decisions in the best \ninterests of not just the American people but the taxpayer \nalso.\n    I believe that at a time of skyrocketing debt and \nunparalleled spending, we must look for other solutions. We \nmust look above the deadlock of partisanship that has mired our \nbudgetary process, and we must make progress. Biennial \nbudgeting may be just one of those solutions, and I will commit \nthat this subcommittee will continue to pursue not only this \nidea but other ideas or plans that others, Members of Congress \nor those outside of Congress, have.\n    I am looking forward to listening to our colleagues and \nexperts so that I can hear their testimony. And obviously I \nwant us to know that Chairman David Dreier has pushed this idea \nfor many, many years, and he today has made sure that he would \nmake himself available for any remarks and to help us to \nunderstand his great idea."

"","","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    The Subcommittee will come to order.\n    Good morning and thank you for coming to our first Subcommittee \nhearing of the 112th Congress. I would like to welcome Ranking Member \nHastings and thank him for his continued assistance as this \nSubcommittee moves forward with hearings. I would also like to thank \nChairman Dreier who is an energetic proponent for biennial budgeting, \nand is the sponsor of the measure we will be considering today. I hope \nhe finds this hearing informative.\n    This hearing before the Subcommittee on Legislative and Budget \nProcess will examine H.R. 114, the Biennial Budgeting and \nAppropriations Act of 2011. Biennial budgeting has been a topic of \nreform since 1977 in the United States and as we see from the interest \nin this hearing, it continues today.\n    Perhaps John Adams may have exaggerated a bit when he said, ``But \nwhen progress has been made, it has been because policymakers have \nabsorbed lessons from past experience and applied them in ways that \nhave improved our processes for governance.'' The budget process can be \nan effective tool. But can biennial budgeting alleviate the burden that \nthis Congress faces every year to meet multiple deadlines in both the \nbudget and appropriations processes? That is the question that our \nhearing today will seek to answer through the testimony of several \ndistinguished Members of Congress and our outside witnesses.\n    This hearing is not intended for the analysis of budget specifics, \nfunding initiatives and priorities, but rather to step back and look at \nthe budget process, to look at the recent interactions between the \nHouses of Congress, and with Executive Branch, to see where we can \nprovide for more effectiveness.\n    Most of us who are sitting at the dais or testifying this morning \nhave a fairly established belief that biennial budgeting will or will \nnot be a useful tool. I don't know whether our fiscal house would be \nbetter or worse as a result of its use. But, I do know that today marks \nthe 1,000th day since the Democratic-controlled Senate last passed a \nBudget. And meanwhile, Congress has failed to pass appropriations bills \nin a timely manner since Fiscal Year 1997; 15 years ago.\n    Are we at a point where the consensus of this legislative body is \nthat we no longer should make hard choices to support the fiscal health \nof this Nation? Do we employ further reforms, such as biennial \nbudgeting, in an effort to reverse the course of the last 1,000 days, \nor should we resign the budget process to the scrapheap of historical \nCongressional reforms?\n    I understand all too well the need for ideological attentiveness. \nBut, at least the current House Leadership has put forward ideas and \nallowed for a deliberative process. On January 17th of this New Year, \nMajority Leader Harry Reid's Deputy Chief of Staff and Policy Director \nall but admitted that Senate Democrats would again not even begin work \non a budget. That is a shameful betrayal of a Congressional process \nthat has a clear track record of driving down wasteful spending through \nproper planning.\n    Most importantly, we must become more efficient as a government. I \nam a cosponsor of H.R. 114 because I believe that utilizing the same \nlong-term planning as the private sector allows us to prepare more \neffectively for the future. The Congress cannot direct this country on \na day-to-day or month-to-month existence, focused not on the best \nfiscal practices, but by short-term spending bridges. Longer federal \ncontracts provide the best opportunity to save taxpayer dollars, while \ndedicating more effort to oversight.\n    I believe that at this time of skyrocketing debt and unparalleled \nspending, we must look for solutions. We must rise above the deadlocked \npartisanship that has mired our budgetary planning in hopelessness. \nBiennial budgeting may just be one of the solutions and I will commit \nthat this subcommittee will continue to pursue any and every proposed \nplan that will restore order to our fiscal house.\n    I am looking forward to listening to our colleagues and experts \ntestify so I will yield back my time and recognize Chairman Dreier, a \nstaunch supporter of biennial budgeting during his tenure in Congress, \nfor any opening remarks he may have."

break,break,break,break,break
"polis","Mr. Polis","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I join Chairman \nSessions in welcoming our distinguished witnesses here today. \nThank you for appearing before our subcommittee hearing on H.R. \n114, the Biennial Budgeting and Appropriations Act of 2011, so \nwelcome to our subcommittee. Again, I think this idea certainly \nhas some merits. I, however, don't believe it is a fix-all or \nsomehow remedies all the problems we have with our budgetary \nprocess; and certainly while it has advantages, it also has \ndisadvantages, and I look forward to exploring those here \ntoday. And many Members will benefit from this information \nbecause I think it will be a close call between the advantages \nand the disadvantages that we will explore over the course of \nthis hearing. Ultimately, it doesn't solve the primary issues \nwith the dysfunction around our budgetary process. It doesn't \nmean that it is not or can't be a constructive step in its own \nright. Obviously if this body wanted to, we could agree to a \nbudget in 1 day or 1 week, but the budget process by its very \nnature is intensely political. We bring different values to \nthat discussion, and we have vociferous debates about the \nmerits of our respective budgets.\n    Even under this proposal in the off years, Congress would \nstill be required to make necessary changes, consider \nsupplemental spending, and would continue to argue over \nauthorizations and other revisions within the budget. So, too, \nthe fundamental challenge that this Congress has to balance the \nbudget is not affected one way or the other by this particular \nproposal, and I would hope that Congress and perhaps even the \nsubcommittee can, in fact, take up reforms that would lead to a \nbalanced budget and not just more predictability over time and \nsome of the other factors that this affects.\n    If both parties want to work together to ensure a smooth \nbudget process, they can do so now. They could also do so under \nthis proposal. This does not in any way, in my opinion, lead to \na better outcome with regard to budgeting. But, again from a \npredictability perspective and other factors, we look forward \nto exploring both the benefits and the costs of this particular \napproach.\n    We know that in a Federal budget process, we have a \npolitical debate, and making the Federal budget biennial won't \nstop those debates. It won't necessarily reduce our workload. \nIt will, for better or worse, transfer some power to the \nexecutive branch, which would have additional leeway during the \noff years, and that is a theme to explore here.\n    We have ample evidence from the States which we will look \nforward to discussing during the hearing as well. It is my \nunderstanding that 19 States have a biennial process, some of \nwhich only have a legislature that meets biennially; others \nhave a legislature that meets both years, but the budget \nprocess is only biennial. And we will look forward to receiving \nand being the beneficiaries of some of the learning from those \nStates that have both processes.\n    My home State of Colorado has an annual budgeting process, \nbut we will look forward to hearing about the evidence from the \nStates about whether this leads to less time spent on \nbudgeting, less overhead for budgeting, a better budget, a more \nbalanced budget, et cetera.\n    We really should be discussing the ways to use a Federal \nbudget to create jobs, order our economy, and balance the \nbudget, and I believe some structural changes to our budgetary \nprocess are needed to lead to a better outcome. Again, this \ndiscussion today should be an interesting one. I look forward \nto receiving the testimony about whether our budgetary process \nshould be annual or biennial, and I am hopeful that we can \nsubsequently engage in a discussion of some of the more serious \nissues concerning our lack of success in balancing our Federal \nbudget and in getting the House, the Senate, and the President \non one page. I thank the chairman for his time, and I yield \nback.\n    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman from Colorado not only \nfor his comments, I recognize he has private sector experience \nwhere he has seen the attributes of not only necessary and \nearly budgeting but also perhaps an opportunity to have an open \nmind that he has. Today I am also honored to have the chairman \nof the full committee, a man who is dedicated to making sure \nthat we follow not only regular order, but have ideas that are \nshared among not just our colleagues but really the general \npublic as well, and I would like to recognize the gentleman for \nsuch time as he would wish to----"

"polis","Mr. Polis","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    I am not sure that that characterization is \ncorrect. I think he, too, like myself, has an open mind, but I \nwould not--I have not received word from the ranking member \nthat is a strong supporter of this initiative."
"dreier","Mr. Dreier","polis","Mr. Polis","    Well, I have. I have received that word, if I \ncould reclaim my time, and I have been told that Mr. Hastings \nis an enthusiastic supporter of the notion of biennial \nbudgeting. And obviously if he were here, he could speak for \nhimself, and so anyway--but if I could proceed, I just, in \nthinking about this issue, I am here because of a couple of \nappropriators. One, the former chairman of the committee who is \nsitting before us, and the other a former member and chairman \nof the Subcommittee on Health and Human Services, Mr. Regula.\n    Mr. Young and Mr. Regula approached me probably a decade \nand a half ago when we were talking about the issue of biennial \nbudgeting, and I was surprised because traditionally there has \nbeen opposition from members of the Appropriations Committee on \nthis issue, believing somehow that going to a biennial process \nundermines the sword of Damocles, the power over the purse, as \nMadison put it in Federalist number 48, to do it on an annual \nbasis, and that is the only way to adequately do oversight. \nWhen these two great appropriators, Chairman Young and Chairman \nRegula, indicated to me that they believed not only could it \nsave money but it would enhance the ability for the \nAppropriations Committee to do greater oversight on this \nissue--and if you look at the 1974 Budget Impoundment Act, I \nran for Congress just actually three years after the 1974 \nBudget Impoundment Act was put into place. And if you look at \nwhat has happened since that time, Democrats and Republicans \nalike recognize the budget process itself is broken. Steps need \nto be taken. And we all know the overused Einstein quote: The \ndefinition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over \nand over again, expecting a different result.\n    But the fact of the matter is, how many times since the \nestablishment of the 1974 Budget Impoundment Act have we \nsuccessfully been able to complete the entire budget and \nappropriations process? Very, very rarely has that happened.\n    Now, I will say that I understand that there is a wide \nrange of views. I have read the opposition. I just last night \nread the study from the Center on Budget Policy, I have read \nfrom the Council of State Legislatures, there has been a mixed \nview from that Laboratory of the States on this. Some States \nhave gone from annual to biennial, some have gone from biennial \nback to an annual process, and so I think that it is important \nto have an open mind on this.\n    I think it is also important for us to realize that there \nare a number of people who have been opponents in the past and \nare now enthusiastic backers. Ed Whitfield and Charlie Bass and \nlots of other people, lots of Democrats have joined working \ntogether on this issue in the past. We worked with Pete \nDomenici, the former chairman of the Budget Committee, and you \nremember, Ed, those meetings we had repeatedly with Chairman \nDomenici as we were working to pass this measure--and you do, \ntoo, Bill--in the early part of this decade. Actually it was \nMay 16th of 2000, we got over 200 votes, the highest number of \nvotes we have ever gotten on any budget process reform measure \non the House floor when we offered this as an amendment 12 \nyears ago this coming May. And one of the strong opponents of \nbiennial budgeting has been the current chairman of the Senate \nBudget Committee, Kent Conrad. Kent Conrad has done a 180-\ndegree. He and I have had several discussions in which he said, \nI was a strong opponent of biennial budgeting, but I believe \nthat it is absolutely essential for us to move towards a \nbiennial process if we are going to have a chance to tackle the \nchallenges that Mr. Polis has correctly raised that need to be \ndone.\n    Obviously, job creation and economic growth are very, very \nimportant. Working towards fiscal responsibility is important. \nOur constitutionally mandated responsibility of congressional \noversight is critically important, and so there are so many \nthings that I believe we can do. Biennial budgeting is not a \npanacea to all the ailments of society. I am the first to admit \nthat. But I do believe that these, exploring new ideas--I don't \nknow that we are going to end up with a complete, complete \nprocess that is biennial. Maybe we begin with incremental steps \non this. Maybe that is a first step because States have had a \nmixed view on this. But I do believe that it is time for us to \nreally get off the dime and move ahead because of what we \nrecognize. I mean, Virginia is wearing the 1000 days button, \nPete talked about the fact that we have gone 1000 days without \naction in the Senate.\n    You know what? We all have responsibility for the problems \nthat have taken place. I mean, I happen to think that this past \nyear we have done pretty well. We passed a budget. We have \ntried our doggonedest to get the appropriations process \nthrough, but with our hands tied it has been difficult for all \nof us. So I want to express my appreciation to Bill Young and \nto Ed Whitfield, whom I know are both here, Mr. Chairman, as \nproponents of this. And my very dear friend David Price is not \nas enthusiastic on this issue, I know, as a member of the \nAppropriations Committee, but we very much wanted to hear from \nhim. We are going to hear from Reid Ribble, who is a member of \nthe Budget Committee and has embraced this notion as well, and \nMr. Lilly is here, and I know we are going to have other \nwitnesses.\n    We wanted to have both perspectives, and so you have put \ntogether what I think will be an interesting first subcommittee \nhearing that we have had in this Congress, and I appreciate \nthat and look forward to hearing from our witnesses, Mr. \nChairman. Thank you.\n    The Chairman. Chairman Dreier, thank you very much. I think \nthat there are perhaps--and if we had given you another 10 \nminutes, I am sure you would have alluded to it--I think the \nAmerican public has a say in how we are seen, that we should \nunderstand that the public needs to have confidence in what we \ndo. And secondly, managers of the government, the business of \nall the agencies, they need the assurance that Congress cannot \nonly hear from them, but give them the necessary tools to act \nefficiently.\n    Obviously, the vice chairman of this subcommittee, the \ngentlewoman, Ms. Foxx, has a dynamic and distinguished \nbackground in the free enterprise system as well as government, \nand I want to thank her for not only being here today but \nlending her time and talent to this effort.\n    Without objection, I would like to enter into the record \ntwo statements, one from the gentleman Kent Conrad and a joint \nletter of Patty Murray and Jeb Hensarling. Without objection, \nthat will be entered into the record."

"","","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    I want to thank Chairman Dreier and Ranking Member Slaughter for \ninviting me to submit testimony to the House Rules Committee on the \nsubject of biennial budgeting.\n    Throughout my tenure as Senate Budget Committee Chairman, I have \nbeen focused on ways we could improve and reform the congressional \nbudget process. For years, I opposed reforms that involved moving to a \nbiennial budget, because I felt the federal government, like any large \nbusiness or organization, needed to establish a budget each year. But I \nnow believe the time for biennial budgeting has come.\n    This past fall, I held a hearing focused on biennial budgeting. \nBased on testimony at that hearing and further discussions with Budget \nCommittee Members, both Democrats and Republicans, Ranking Member \nSessions (R-AL) and I sent a letter to the Joint Select Committee on \nDeficit Reduction recommending a switch to biennial budgeting. I am \nsubmitting a copy of that joint letter and request that it be included \nin the Committee record for this hearing.\n    My reason for supporting biennial budgeting is clear. The current \nbudget process is simply not working. It has become increasingly \ndifficult to pass and conference a budget resolution, particularly \nduring election years. Year after year, we face continuing resolutions, \nomnibus bills, supplementals, and, increasingly, threats of shutting \ndown the government. At the same time, we see far too little oversight \nof federal agencies and programs. Biennial budgeting won't solve all of \nthese problems. But it could help.\n    It is important to remember that Congress has effectively moved to \nbiennial budgeting already. In fact, since 1998, budgets have been \npassed in only two election years--in 2000 when Senator Domenici was \nChairman of the Senate Budget Committee and 2008 when I was Chairman.\n    Moving to biennial budgeting would allow Congress to spend more \ntime on oversight. Under the current system, as soon as the budget \nprocess ends for one fiscal year, the next year's process has begun. \nThis leaves little time for Congress to focus on authorizations and \noversight, or to examine mandatory spending and tax policy with the \nrigor that these parts of the budget require. Biennial budgeting would \nappropriately shift Congress's attention to longer-term budgetary \nissues and the oversight that is critically needed in this era of \nconstrained federal resources. It would result in more accountability \nfrom the Executive Branch--ensuring that scarce federal resources are \nbeing used efficiently and effectively.\n    Moving to biennial budgeting could also result in a reduction in \nthe use of continuing resolutions and omnibus bills. And it would allow \nfor better long-term planning by federal agencies and programs.\n    Several variations of biennial budgeting have been proposed. As \nSenator Sessions and I noted in our joint letter, we believe the most \neffective biennial budgeting framework would include the following \nelements: In odd-number years, the President would submit a two-year \nbudget and Congress would pass a two-year budget resolution. Congress \nwould focus on authorizations and oversight when not budgeting. The \nBudget Committees would conduct performance-based reviews of federal \nprograms. These reviews would examine discretionary and mandatory \nspending programs, as well as tax expenditures and other revenue-\nrelated policies. And the Budget Committees would issue a report and \nother materials in the off year detailing the findings and conclusions \nof the Committee, including recommendations regarding underperforming \nfederal programs.\n    The Senate Budget Committee did not have agreement on whether \nappropriation bills should be enacted on one- or two-year cycles, or a \ncombination of one- and two-year cycles. However, many members of the \nCommittee support biennial appropriations as well as biennial budgets.\n    As I noted, biennial budgeting won't solve all of our budget \nproblems. Ultimately, the nation's long-term fiscal imbalance will only \nbe solved with a bipartisan, comprehensive, and balanced deficit and \ndebt reduction agreement. But biennial budgeting could make a positive \ncontribution toward fiscal discipline. And there is growing bipartisan \nsupport in both the House and Senate for changing to a biennial budget \ncycle.\n    Again, I want to thank Chairman Dreier and Ranking Member Slaughter \nfor inviting me to submit testimony on this critical budgeting issue."

At this time I would like to acknowledge and \nwelcome the first panel that we have, obviously three \ndistinguished Members of Congress, as Chairman Dreier had \nalluded to. Perhaps they come with agreement or not, but they \ncome with ideas, and this subcommittee hearing today, and what \nwe are trying to do in this process is to hear from people who \nare deeply engaged in that process.\n    As a former member of the Budget Committee, I have my own \nopinion, but today we are going to look at those who have their \nopinions based upon vast service to this United States \nCongress. And I would like to welcome Congressmen Bill Young, \nEd Whitfield, and David Price as they come to testify today.\n    And by way of introduction, Chairman Young, thank you for \ntaking time to address this important issue. You were the last \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee to oversee a balanced \nannual budget. That is important. And those who have a steady \nhand on that wheel understand how hard that is. He is also \ncosponsor of the biennial budgeting bill that is before us \ntoday.\n    Congressman Ed Whitfield serves on the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee, and obviously he is a long-time advocate for the \nbiennial budgeting and has worked with David Dreier to \nintroduce H.R. 114.\n    And I am delighted to have David Price, our friend who is a \nwell respected member of the Appropriations Committee, \ncurrently serving as the ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nHomeland Security.

"","","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    Mr. Young. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I think that \nit is appropriate that this subject be discussed openly and in \na legislative forum because it certainly has a lot of merit. At \nleast I believe so. And Chairman Dreier and I have worked \ntogether on this issue now for many, many years, and we don't \nsee any political advantage or political disadvantage. This has \nnothing to do with politics. It has to do with getting our work \ndone.\n    Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution makes it very \nclear that appropriations bills are must-pass legislation. Too \noften we end up not passing an appropriations bill, but we pass \na CR or we lump a lot of appropriations bills into an omnibus \nor a mini-omnibus. In my opinion, that is not a good practice, \nwhether it is a governmental agency, whether it is the Defense \nDepartment--and they would be very big on this issue--or \nprivate business or even in your home. You have got to be able \nto plan. You can't just jump from one issue to another when you \nare planning your financial stability in your family, your \nbusiness, or your government agency.\n    If appropriations bills don't pass, it is hard to plan. \nNow, we have passed 2-year appropriations bills. This is not \nsomething that is new. I would give you this example. In \ncalendar year 2010 we didn't pass appropriations bills. We \nended up in 2011 and passed most of the appropriations bills \nfrom the previous year on a CR. One of the few exceptions was \nthe defense appropriations bill. So we actually introduced that \nbill, it became part of H.R. 1. It was conferenced with the \nSenate in the regular process, and we did pass a good bill. I \nwant to give my friend and my colleague Congressman Norman \nDicks a lot of credit. He was chairman after Jack Murtha's \nuntimely death. Norm Dicks was chairman of the subcommittee, \nand as usual we worked together to produce a bill. Whoever is \nchairman or ranking member, we work together to produce the \ndefense bill. The problem was that Chairman Dicks had a good \ndefense bill, but couldn't get it on the floor. Leadership \nwouldn't even let him go to the full committee with it. And so \nthat didn't pass.\n    So the early part of 2011, we did take up H.R. 1, which was \nthe defense bill for fiscal year 2011. Then after we completed \nthat, we began the process for the 2012 defense bill, and we \npassed that. We went through the regular order, we went to the \nSenate and conferenced with our Senate colleagues. We had a \ngood bill. We had a very large bipartisan vote in the House and \nthe Senate, and so we actually did pass in 1 year 2 years of \nappropriations for national defense.\n    With regard to being able to plan ahead, one of the issues \nthat we have in defense budgeting is you start a project, you \nstop a project, you terminate the project. Termination costs \nare very expensive. By being able to budget for at least 2 \nyears, you can plan ahead a little better and try to avoid \nhaving these programs that stop-start-stop-start, which, as I \nsaid, are very, very expensive.\n    Now, there are some who might think the Constitution says, \nwell, you must appropriate every year. It doesn't say that. To \nthe contrary, I looked very closely to make sure that my \nrecollection was accurate, because I read the Constitution on a \nregular basis, especially the part about appropriations.\n    The founders of our great system, our constitutional \nsystem, included in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution \nthis language: ``To raise and support armies, but no \nappropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term \nthan 2 years.'' Now, the founders didn't say you had to do it \nfor 2 years, but they did say you can't do it for longer than 2 \nyears. This says to me that they made it possible for a 2-year \nbudget process and for 2-year appropriations bills. So I think \nwe are on good constitutional grounds to do this, and I think \nthe effectiveness of a 2-year budget should be pretty much \nrecognized.\n    But I would just close on this one point, Mr. Chairman. For \nthose of us, especially who are appropriators, we get \ncriticized in the media considerably; well, why did this \nhappen, why did that happen? This contract really blew out of \nproportion or this contract doesn't work.\n    In order to get the proper oversight, you have got to have \ntime. Getting a bill written, with all of the hearings, with \nall of the process of going to subcommittee, going to the full \ncommittee, going to the floor, and then going to conference \nwith the Senate, it is very time consuming. Now, if we had a 2-\nyear process, we could spend 1 year doing the oversight that we \nget criticism about for not doing enough oversight. Well, there \nare only so many hours in a day. We should do more oversight, \nand I would like to do more oversight on the subcommittee that \nI chair. If we had a 2-year process, I could spend a whole year \ndoing oversight and finding out about those problems, \nhopefully, finding out about those problems that might come \nback to bite us later on. But when your time constraints are a \nproblem, that is not always possible.\n    So you could appropriate one year and do a year's worth of \noversight, which in my opinion would be very, very cost \nproductive for the taxpayer and would make much more efficient \nFederal agencies that could plan ahead a little bit more than \nthey can plan ahead today, especially with the use of so many \nCRs and a lot of uncertainty in where we are going.\n    That is my story today, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for the \nopportunity to relate it.\n    The Chairman. Chairman Young, thank you very much, and I am \nsure you are going to stick to the process that you have \noutlined because there should be a better result that comes \nfrom that. I want to thank you for taking time to be with us \ntoday to lend your not only insight but the advantages of your \nservice to this great Nation, and in particular to the men and \nwomen of our military who protect this great Nation every \nsingle day.\n    The gentleman Mr. Price is recognized."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    Mr. Price. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It was almost a dozen \nyears ago that I testified before this distinguished committee \nabout a proposal very similar to the one before us today. \nCircumstances, however, are very different. There had been \nmultiyear budgeting--budget agreements enacted in 1990, 1993, \nand 1997--and the economy was doing very well. All this had \nproduced several years of balanced budgets, and we were paying \ndown more than $400 billion of this Nation's debt.\n    Now it is not the same. Following a decade of net zero \neconomic growth, trillions of dollars in lost tax revenues, two \nunpaid-for wars, a necessary but expensive government response \nto the great recession, and after a year in which admittedly \nworst of congressional budget politics has been on full \ndisplay, it is understandable that the idea of biennial \nbudgeting would once again hold some appeal for Members in \nsearch of solutions to our current woes.\n    I, in particular, have deep respect for my good friend \nDavid Dreier who has championed this proposal. There is no \nquestion that his concern for the well-being of our institution \nis as great as any Member of this House. But I have to say that \nI believe this is a flawed remedy, a remedy that might actually \nbe worse than the disease.\n    I am, of course, the first to agree that the congressional \nbudget and appropriations processes have eroded significantly. \nThe pressures of divided government, a polarized electorate, \nthe increased use of the Senate filibuster, and the general \nsubjugation, I fear, of Congress' power of the purse to \npartisan political consideration have greatly delayed the \nenactment of our annual spending bills and have increased our \nreliance on bloated omnibus packages. But biennial budgeting \nwould do nothing to address the underlying causes of this \ndysfunction and would likely make matters worse by weakening \ncongressional oversight of the executive, by jacking even more \ndecisions up to the leadership of both parties, and by \nincreasing our reliance on supplemental appropriations bills \nconsidered outside the regular order.\n    Most importantly, biennial budgeting would weaken Congress' \npower to shape national priorities by conducting effective \noversight of the executive branch. Proponents of biennial \nbudgeting claim that it would, quote, ``free up Congress to \nconduct oversight in the off year.''\n    Now, that claim is supremely ironic, for the most careful \nand effective oversight Congress conducts is through the annual \nappropriations process where an agency's performance and needs \nare reviewed program by program, line by line. That is \noversight. It is probably the best oversight we conduct. An \noff-year oversight would be less, not more, effective, because \nit would be, in a word, impotent, further removed from actual \nfunding decisions.\n    Supporters also like to note that four recent Presidents, \nGeorge W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Ronald \nReagan, all supported biennial budgeting. Why are we not \nsurprised? Of course they did. If this suggests that the \nproposal is not a partisan issue, it should warn us it \ndefinitely is an institutional issue. Of course, Presidents \nwould support a free pass every other year from a legislative \nprocess that could make or break their agenda, just as they \ntend to support the line-item veto. They love it. A ban on \ncongressional earmarks, they love that, too, and other \nchallenges to Congress' authority vis-a-vis the executive \nbranch.\n    Now, I am aware of the charge that opponents of biennial \nbudgets are merely defending Appropriations Committee turf. I \nam sensitive to that, because I am a senior appropriator. But \nthe annual work of appropriations serves the entire institution \nand its place in the constitutional balance of power. That is \nthe fundamental truth about appropriations if it works the way \nit should, and in one respect it could make the work of \nappropriations leaders less accountable. Faced with outdated \nand unworkable funding levels for individual programs in the \nsecond year of a biennial appropriation, each Federal \ndepartment will be forced to present the Appropriations \nCommittee with countless requests to reallocate or reprogram \ntheir annual budgets. Typically, those requests are granted or \ndenied solely by the Appropriations subcommittee chairmen and \nranking members without debate, without amendments, without \nvotes, without public scrutiny.\n    Off-year budget problems that could not be handled through \nreprogramming requests would necessitate supplemental \nappropriations bills. We already enact supplemental bills when \nunforeseen emergency needs crop up after an appropriations bill \nhas been enacted.\n    Budgeting 2 years in advance can only lead to a greater \nmismatch between the country's needs and agency budgets. In \nfact, the whole purpose of a biennial budget could be \nundermined by the proliferation of supplementals in off-years. \nPerversely, we would have replaced the deliberative and \ndemocratic process of annual appropriations with supplemental \nbills that are sporadic, rushed, and heavily controlled by \nleadership.\n    In fact, our experience last year should lead us to \nconclude, if anything, that the annual appropriations process \nmight be the best chance we have for the kind of bipartisan \ncooperation that will be required to get a handle on our long-\nterm fiscal situation.\n    Where the supercommittee failed to come to agreement even \non the basic terms of a long-term deficit reduction package, \nthe Appropriations Committee produced two year-end \nappropriations packages that, while far from perfect, produced \nsignificant budget savings. And they were drafted, considered, \nand approved on a bipartisan basis, and both Chairman Rogers \nand Ranking Member Dicks are due a great deal of credit for \nthat.\n    So for reasons practical as well as institutional, biennial \nbudgeting isn't any better an idea today than it was a decade \nago. It would be a mistake to allow recent budget disagreements \nto lure us toward a supposed remedy that actually would make \nthe appropriations process less systematic, less flexible, and \nless potent. It isn't the congressional budget process that is \nin need of repair, it is our collective will to make difficult \nand politically costly decisions.\n    So I urge colleagues to reject the siren song of biennial \nbudgeting, to redouble our efforts to address the underlying \ncauses of our long-term fiscal challenges. Thank you.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Price, thank you very much not only for \nyour ideas but also your voice today. This subcommittee, as \nwell you know, the Rules Committee is the sounding board for \nMembers as part of the process who agree and disagree, and your \ntestimony years ago as well as your testimony today is \nsomething that I believe we have to take into account. With \nthat said, we also believe looking at the issue and the idea to \nmake it better is important. So thank you for taking time to be \nwith us today."

"","","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    A dozen years ago next month, I testified before this distinguished \nCommittee about a proposal very similar to the one you are considering \ntoday. The circumstances could have not been more different: the \nenactment of multi-year budget agreements in 1990, 1993, and 1997, \ncoupled with a growing economy, had produced several years of balanced \nbudgets and allowed us to pay down more than $400 billion of the \nnational debt.

break,break,break,break,break
"","","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    Mr. Whitfield. Chairman Sessions, thank you very much, and \nMr. Polis, Ms. Foxx, and my friend David Dreier. This is one of \nthose issues that people do have very strong views on, and I am \nreally pleased to have the opportunity to testify on the \nBiennial Budget and Appropriation Act of 2011.\n    I would say that in 1974 when Congress passed the \nCongressional Budget and Impoundment Act, which was intended to \ngive the President and Congress a timeline on which to base a \nbudget and appropriations bill, that during the 36 years since \nthat time Congress has met the deadline for completion of a \nbudget resolution only six times. And just last year the House \npassed a fiscal year 2012 budget, the Senate was unable to act; \nand of course the Congress before that, that Congress was \nunable to act. So we have gone for over 1000 days without a \nFederal budget. And I might also say that according to CBO, \nCongress has provided $290 billion in fiscal year 2010 for \nprograms whose authorizations have expired.\n    Now, I don't see this as a panacea to solve our economic \nproblems, our unemployment problems, the partisanship problems \nthat we have in the U.S. Congress. But I do firmly believe in \nthe discussions that I have had with a lot of people in my \ndistrict, recognizing that Kentucky is only one small rural \nState, but Congress gets such bad publicity when they do not \nfinish their appropriation process, when they do not have a \nbudget, and I genuinely believe that part of the reason people \nhave such little respect for this institution is the fact that \nevery time we fail to do this--and we fail to do it \nfrequently--the national news media totally focuses on the \ninability to pass a budget, to finish appropriation bills.\n    And I had asked my staff, evidently the last time that we \nactually finished all appropriation bills in the House and the \nSenate, signed by the President, was 1997. We did it in 1995 \nand 1989. But there is something broken about this system, and \nI have the greatest respect for my chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Mr. Rogers of Kentucky, and Mr. Price \nof North Carolina, and all of them who serve on the \nappropriation process, but I genuinely believe in my view that \nthe appropriators drive the Congress.\n    Now, we all know that leadership can do anything that it \nwants to do, and I can't imagine the leadership of the Congress \nbeing any stronger than it has been in the last 6, 7, 8 years, \nbecause the leadership controls everything. But in my view this \ngives opportunity--one of the things I find so frustrating, I \nhave talked to a lot of appropriators, not Mr. Price on this \nissue, but talk about how when they are unable to finish their \nappropriation bill, they go on an omnibus bill or they go to a \nsupplemental or whatever, a CR or whatever. Inevitably, since \neveryone knows that this bill has to move, all sorts of \nauthorized legislation is put in there without adequate \noversight, without adequate hearings, and I believe that it \ncontributes significantly to bad legislation that we pass, bad \nchanges that we pass without sufficient forethought of the \nconsequences of it. And if you have--as Chairman Young said, \nthe people who wrote our Constitution certainly had in mind \nthat we could go to 2 years if we wanted to, and there is no \nquestion with the complexity of government today, with the \namount of money being involved, I would think the appropriators \nwould love to have an opportunity to one year focus on budget, \nfocus on appropriation, and then next year do their oversight, \nwhich would also give the authorizing committees more time \nbecause every single year the whole Congress, the whole \nadministration, is caught up in the budget process, the \nappropriations process. And as I said a while ago, I genuinely \nbelieve that this is a major reason why the American people \nhave such little respect for the United States Congress as an \ninstitution.\n    And I know it is not a panacea, but Mr. Dreier mentioned \nthat in 2000 we did have the vote, and I remember how pleased \nwe were that Mr. Young, as chairman at that time, voted for the \nlegislation. The vote was 201 to 217, and I do remember certain \nDemocrats who were really quite vocal at that time. Mr. Doggett \nof Texas was one. Mr. DeFazio was one. I remember Bobby Clement \nof Tennessee who is no longer with us. But, I mean, I could \ntalk about this issue for a long time, as I know all of you \ncould. And I am delighted that some of the freshmen members are \ngoing to be here testifying today, too, but I do thank the \nRules Committee for providing us an opportunity, because \nwhether we go to a biennial system or not, I think it is \nimportant for the American people to at least have the debate \nand have the transparency of what is perceived to be the \nproblem by many of us. And with that, Mr. Chairman, thank you \nfor the opportunity to be here.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Whitfield, thank you very much."

"","","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Members of the Committee, \nfor giving me the opportunity to be here to testify before you today.\n    As you know, we currently find ourselves in the midst of uncertain \nand difficult economic times.\n    Our challenged budget process, which led us to the brink of a \ngovernment shutdown earlier this year, hampers our ability to \neffectively solve these economic problems.\n    While the White House says we are on the road to economic recovery, \nfamilies in my District, the First Congressional District of Kentucky, \nare still struggling to hold onto their jobs, their home and their \nhealth care.\n    While the national unemployment rate has fallen to 8.5%, Kentucky's \nunemployment rate remains at an alarming 9.4%.\n    In fact, many counties in my District have an unemployment rate \nthat is even higher then Kentucky's state average.\n    Adding to our economic troubles is the national debt, which has \nskyrocketed over the past few years, reaching almost $15.3 trillion \ntoday.\n    In fact, Doug Elmendorf, the Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, said that ``U.S. fiscal policy is on an unsustainable path to \nan extent that it cannot be solved by minor tinkering.''\n    So, in order to maintain our global competiveness it is essential \nthat we drastically reduce our federal spending.\n    One way to eliminate wasteful government spending is to reform and \nstreamline our budget process.\n    In 1974, Congress passed the Congressional Budget and Impoundment \nAct, which was intended to give the President and Congress a timeline \non which to base a budget and appropriations bills.\n    As we well know, even when followed, the Budget Act has resulted in \nan annual rush which results NOT ONLY in a poor process, but also \nreduces the amount of time available for careful oversight and \nmanagement of existing federal programs.\n    During the 38 year history of the Budget Act, Congress has met the \ndeadline for completion of a budget resolution only six times.\n    Just last year, the House passed a Fiscal Year 2012 budget; however \nthe Senate failed to act and Congress has gone for over 1,000 days \nwithout a federal budget.\n    With these procedural problems in mind, I joined Representative \nDreier in introducing H.R. 114, the Biennial Budgeting and \nAppropriations Act of 2011.\n    I started working on biennial budgeting with my friend and \ncolleague Chairman Dreier back in the 106th Congress, when he offered a \nbiennial budget proposal as an amendment to H.R. 853, the Comprehensive \nBudget Process Reform Act of 1999. The amendment vote was close, 201 to \n217, and I haven't stopped supporting the idea since. I am very pleased \nthat the issue is gaining momentum again.\n    Specifically, H.R. 114 will require the President to submit a two-\nyear budget and Congress would consider a two-year budget resolution \nand a two-year appropriations cycle.\n    I believe that a biennial budget cycle will result in better \nscrutiny of federal spending and the elimination of wasteful and \nduplicative government programs because in one year the House can focus \non making the programs better or eliminating them, and in the next year \nthe House can focus on the spending levels for those programs.\n    Such oversight is badly needed. According to CBO, Congress provided \n$290.8 billion in Fiscal Year 2010 appropriations for 250 statutes \nwhose authorizations had expired.\n    That money should be scrutinized more thoroughly by Congress, \nespecially if the authorizing committees allowed the authorizations to \nexpire.\n    Streamlining the budget process will allow Congress more time to \nconcentrate on other important legislative issues, such as reducing \noverall federal spending and spurring economic growth so that America \nwill remain globally competitive and our economy will get back on \ntrack.\n    Thank you again, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, for \npermitting me to testify before you today.\n    At this time, I would be happy to answer any questions you may \nhave."

I also would \nnote that you have written remarks, and I would ask, without \nobjection, that those be entered into the record, and I want to \nthank you. I would go first to the gentlewoman, the vice \nchairman of the committee, Ms. Foxx."
"foxx","Ms. Foxx","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    I just want to say that I have learned a lot this \nmorning from the presentations that have been made by the panel \nmembers. It has been very enlightening, and I want to thank you \nall for the effort that you have put into working to improve \nthe process that we are working under. I think we have a lot of \nwork to do to educate Members, as well as the public, about our \nprocess and about the challenges that we face, so I just want \nto say thank you to you all for what you are doing.\n    I think, as Chairman Dreier has said, it is important that \nwe hear all the perspectives that are out there, and I think \nthat the hearings that this subcommittee is going to hold and \nthat the Rules Committee will hold also, will help bring to the \nfore some important issues that we need to be dealing with.\n    It is distressing to me that we see the polls that say \nCongress is held in such low esteem. I don't think they are \nwarranted because I think we have great people here on both \nsides of the aisle who want to do good things, who come here \nwith the intention of making the process better and serving the \npeople that they represent. So I hope that we can do some \nthings that will improve our status in the eyes of the American \npeople, because we learn how to do things more effectively. So \nthank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. I thank the gentlewoman. Mr. Polis."
"polis","Mr. Polis","foxx","Ms. Foxx","    Yeah I just have a couple questions for the \npanel.\n    First, I would like to ask Mr. Price, I think one of the \nitems of discussion is how this proposal changes the balance \nbetween the executive and legislative branch. What powers in \npractice do you see as being transferred to the executive \nbranch if this is--if this becomes the way that we do our \nbudgets?\n    Mr. Price. Legally no direct transfer of powers would \noccur. Practically and politically, I believe that relaxing on \nthat second year of scrutiny and oversight and moving to more \nand more appropriations bills that are removed from the \nsubcommittee level and jacked up to leadership would enhance \nthe power of the party leaders in this institution and probably \nalso increases the incoming fire from the partisan warfare \noutside to the appropriations process, neither of which is a \ndesired result. That has already gone farther than it should. \nAnd, to the extent that occurs, it also, of course, brings in \nthe White House, whoever the President is.\n    The trend toward omnibus bills, of course, does some of \nthis, and we need to return to regular order. Again, I give \nChairman Rogers and Ranking Member Dicks a lot of credit for \nthe extent to which we did that this year. Omnibus bills do \nthis, certainly supplementals do, and certainly the kind of \ncorrections that the agencies ask for in terms of reprogramming \nfunds. All involve much more party leadership up here and much \nmore White House involvement from downtown."
"polis","Mr. Polis","polis","Mr. Polis","    Thank you. A question for Mr. Whitfield. You \nmentioned that something is broken about the system. I think, \nyou know, with the statistics you indicated about the relative \nrarity of a budget ever being agreed to, I think we all agree \nthat the system needs to be improved. But it seems to me that, \nyou know, what is being discussed here today is saying, well, \nlet's parade our failure less often in front of the American \npublic. I think you mentioned that perhaps the yearly failure \nkind of feeds into the perception of the American public that \nCongress is dysfunctional. To show our failure off half as \noften, you argued, could potentially help improve the \nreputation of this body to get things done.\n    Isn't it more important, though, to actually enact reforms \nthat lead to a more successful outcome? Whether that is an \nannual or biennial success, isn't that more successful? And do \nyou see this proposal as leading to a more successful outcome \nor just parading our failure less often in front of the \nAmerican public?\n    Mr. Whitfield. I see this proposal as leading us to being \nmore able to complete our work. I don't view it as displaying \nour failures less often. I genuinely believe that this reform \nwould significantly improve the product of the U.S. Congress \nboth substantively as well as on the appropriation budget's \nsize.\n    I have had a lot of discussions with people at CBO as well \nas OMB. And Mr. Price is right; every President in recent \nmemory supported this proposition, because in my discussions \nwith OMB, they are talking about how they are so inundated each \nyear with the appropriation process that they are just swamped, \nand if they could do it over 2 years, recognizing sometimes you \nhave emergencies you have to intervene with, that I just feel \nit would free up the Congress. We wouldn't be clogged up every \nyear with this race to finish the job. So I genuinely believe \nit would improve the product of the Congress."

"","","polis","Mr. Polis","    Chairman Sessions, on January 24, 2012, Rules Chairman David Dreier \nnoted during a Legislative and Budget Process Subcommittee Hearing, \nthat I was ``enthusiastic'' about his bill H.R. 114, the Biennial \nBudgeting and Appropriations Act of 2011.\n    While I am certainly not opposed to Congress debating the merits of \nbiennial budgeting, and do not believe that biennial budgeting is \nnecessarily a bad idea, I do think that its disadvantages outweigh its \nadvantages, and that it ultimately will not work with a budget as \ncomplex and as fraught with partisanship as ours.\n    Furthermore, I would beg to differ with my colleague from \nCalifornia's assessment of my ``so called'' enthusiasm for his \nlegislation--I am not even a co-sponsor of his bill. During the recent \nsubcommittee hearing, he made that assertion and I would like the \nrecord to reflect his enthusiasm for his own bill is not shared by me.\n    Mr. Chairman, I also do not see how we can completely transform the \nfederal budget process in this manner without first trying out a few \ntest cases. If we are really serious about biennial budgeting, we ought \nto identify a few federal programs we can test this out on for a few \nbudget cycles, before imposing it on the entire federal structure.\n    The problem with our annual budget and appropriations debates is \nnot the timeline, but rather the political leadership. Smoothing out a \nfew procedures here and there is not going to magically make our budget \ndebates any easier.\n    I suspect there is a correlation between interest in biennial \nbudgeting and the level of partisanship here in the House.\n    If this body really wanted to, we could agree on a budget in one \nday. Or even in one week. But the budget is an intensely political \nprocess and that's not going to change if we do it every year or every \nother year. And even in the ``off' years, we would still be required to \nmake necessary changes, consider supplemental spending, and argue over \nauthorizations and other revisions.\n    If Republicans were truly committed to working with Democrats and \nthe President to ensure a smooth budget process, they would do so. \nRather than tying our hands in convoluted budgetary procedures.\n    If ensuring a smooth process means that Republicans are not going \nto try to eliminate Medicare, or pass tax cuts for the wealthiest \nAmericans, or threaten to default on our national debt, then by all \nmeans let's pass these reform bills.\n    But we all know the reality of the situation and that is, nothing \nis going to happen. Making the federal budget biennial will not stop \nthe political debates, will not reduce our workload, and will \nultimately result in a huge transfer of power to the Executive Branch, \nwhich by necessity will have greater leeway with the purse strings.\n    We ought to be about the business of finding ways in the federal \nbudget to create jobs, to support struggling Americans, and to ensure \nthat we are not leaving those with the least in these difficult times \nto fend for themselves.\n    In 1940, 44 states practiced biennial budgeting. This number is \ndown to 19. It is clear that so many states have abandoned biennial \nbudgeting over the last decade; you cannot responsibly implement a \nmeaningful budget two to three years in advance.\n    In closing, I believe that this budget process gimmickry isn't \ngoing to make the Republican Party any more willing to work with \nDemocrats and the President on these matters. And therefore, I find \nthis process completely futile."

"","","polis","Mr. Polis","    Mr. Young. Mr. Chairman, I would like to just add one quick \nword. I don't want to parade our failures. That is not what I \nam about. I want to prevent our failures. I want to get the job \ndone. And that is what I think we were all sent here to do. So \nparading failures, unless you just want to run against Congress \nand say, gee, look how bad they are, I don't do that and I \ndon't think it is really good politics to do that, but some \npeople do it. We want to prevent the failures, and to do that \nwe have to work together.\n    This is not a political thing. This is not a partisan \nissue. I don't have any political interest in how we do this. I \nam just thinking of a way to get the job done more efficiently \nfor the Congress, but also for the agencies that we appropriate \nfor and especially, in my case, the Department of Defense. That \nis one place we just don't want a lot of inefficiencies and \nmake a lot of mistakes.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I am going to give my comments \nin just a minute, but I think I read your text, and those were \njust words as opposed to writing them down. But I completely \nagree with you, and that is once again why we are here and \nperhaps why a man with insight who aims at trying to make it a \nbetter process, we are glad you are here.\n    I would like to recognize, if I can at this time, the \ngentleman Mr. Dreier, the chairman of the Rules Committee."
"dreier","Mr. Dreier","polis","Mr. Polis","    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and let me \nfirst say that I look forward to reading Mr. Hastings' \nstatement that he as the ranking member of this subcommittee \nwill submit for the record. And if I exaggerated his level of \nenthusiasm and support, I was under the impression that he was \nsupportive. But I think that Mr. Young makes a very important \npoint. I do know that Peter DeFazio and Lloyd Doggett and lots \nof Democrats are very, very, very enthusiastic supporters of \nthis notion. Again, not believing it is a panacea, and again I \nthink we need to soberly look at this, but I do believe that it \ndoes--it is something that is more than worthy of exploration, \nand that is why I appreciate the leadership of this \nsubcommittee pursuing this with the kind of enthusiasm that you \nhave.\n    I think that one of the things that led me to introduce \nthis beyond the inspiration that I got from Bill Young and \nRalph Regula, Ed Whitfield, and so many others has been the \nfact that there is a potential for us to bring about great \nsavings. And I think it gets to what Mr. Whitfield just raised \non this OMB question. I looked at some numbers here last night \nas I was perusing this. According to CBO in fiscal year 2010, \nCongress appropriated $290.8 billion for 250 expired laws, laws \nthat weren't even on the books. And I think that that just \nunderscores the imperative for this kind of oversight.\n    And it is interesting as I listen to the two appropriators \nat the table, Mr. Price and Mr. Young, who share the same goal, \nbut obviously, I mean, Mr. Price believes that if we don't do \nthis annually that we undermine the ability for oversight; Mr. \nYoung believes that if we could do this on a biennial way, we \nhave more time and opportunity for oversight. And, you know, I, \nlike Mr. Price, am a proud institutionalist, and I do think \nthat there is a valid point to look at this Presidential \nsupport and the struggle between the two branches of \ngovernment. I think that is a very, very fair and important \nquestion to raise.\n    And I used in my opening remarks the sword of Damocles does \nin fact--you know, in Madison's power over the purse, which is \nthe wording that they used, is that undermined? I mean, I have \njust come to the conclusion that the executive branch knows \nthat we do have that power, and the fact that we would expend \nthat year engaging in even greater scrutiny is something that I \nthink in and of itself poses a situation which would create \neven greater concern and necessity for them to respond to the \noversight questions that are raised.\n    Now, Mr. Price said that this was not an issue of process, \nMr. Chairman; it had to do with the will, our will. And one of \nthe things that I found when I first introduced this, again, \nnearly a decade and a half ago, was that virtually everybody \nacknowledged the 1974 Budget Impoundment Act has been a \nfailure. And I would just like to ask Mr. Price if in fact he \nbelieves that there need to be changes to the 1974 Budget and \nImpoundment Act?\n    You know, one could infer from the testimony by saying that \nthis is not about process, but rather our will, one could infer \nthat you believe that we don't need to make changes. And what I \nam trying to do is I am trying to explore and look at ways in \nwhich we can do this.\n    Mr. Whitfield correctly pointed out that only in 3 years \nsince the establishment of it, have we gone through and \ncompleted the process without continuing resolutions to keep \nthe government open. So I guess I would ask the question that \nfrankly most of my colleagues, Democrat and Republican alike, \nhave said to me that the system is broken. What do you think?\n    Mr. Price. I am not a huge fan of the budget process, and I \nthink in many ways it does not serve us well. I believe, \nthough, that the heart of the system--the heart of the power of \nthe purse--remains appropriations. And, I see nothing in the \nbiennial budgeting proposal that would really change the way \nappropriations is working except just to cut the process in \nhalf. In other words, I don't see anything here that would make \nit easier to adhere to the regular order in terms of \nsubcommittee performance, the hearings, the markups, the \nreporting and passage of bills. They would still take place in \nthat same 9-month time frame. There would still be--unless we \naddress the political divisions and dysfunction--I think that \nbiennial budgeting would be a formula for once again having the \nprocess collapse in the fall and having to revert to omnibus \nbills. They would just be 2-year omnibus bills, not 1-year \nomnibus bills. I don't see any way here that the basic \ndifficulties that we have had would be directly addressed."
"dreier","Mr. Dreier","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    What about this notion of--I mean the point \nthat I made, you know, $290.6 billion, over a quarter of a \ntrillion dollars, appropriated for 250 programs that didn't \neven exist. It would seem to me that if you had that year, that \nif the Appropriations Committee as well as the authorizing \ncommittees did realize that to really--as Mr. Young has said so \nwell--to really hone in on these issues and ensure that we \nvery, very, very carefully expend each taxpayer dollar would \nbe--I mean, I remember Ralph Regula telling me about the \npotential savings. I mean if we are talking about fiscal \nresponsibility, the one that Ralph--you remember this, Bill--\nused to regularly point to is energy costs. If we had the \nability to have a 2-year process and could expend and could \nnegotiate contracts over a 2-year period of time versus doing \nit annually, the savings to the taxpayer dollars would be \ntremendous.\n    And so I mean you look at these kinds of things that can go \na long way toward helping us achieve this goal, and I think \nthat process-wise as well as getting to what we all share our \nconcern about, the lack of fiscal responsibility that has \nemanated from this place, would be addressed.\n    Mr. Price. Just a quick three-part response. First of all, \nthe system does have the flexibility to allow multiyear \nbudgeting in certain areas. I think it would be fine to move \ntoward a more multiyear perspective with our budget \nresolutions. And, I think Mr. Young's example is a good one. In \ndefense areas, with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, \nand certain veterans areas, we have done multiyear budgeting. \nAnd, in those targeted instances, I think there is a lot to be \nsaid for that. But tour current system has the flexibility to \npermit that now without a wholesale switch to biennial \nbudgeting.\n    Secondly, your point about authorizations is very, very \nimportant. It is a scandal that hundreds of programs are \nunauthorized. But, I am not sure what conclusion we draw from \nthat. Do we go to a different authorization process? In many \nways, as Mr. Whitfield says, appropriations becomes the only \nvehicle available to fix difficulties with authorizations. And \nbelieve me, when that is done on appropriations bills, it is \nwith the assent of the authorization leaders.\n    You know, appropriations isn't just free-wheeling here and \nadding measures willy-nilly to appropriations bills. This is \noften, and usually done, in cooperation with the authorization \nleaders.\n    If we are talking about what has bogged down around here, \nlet's think about the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nlet's think about the transportation authorization. Often it is \nthe annual appropriations that gives us some vehicle for doing \nthings we need to do on the authorization side.\n    And finally, when you talk about what kind of oversight has \nclout, I can tell you that oversight has more clout when it is \ntied to funding decisions. Many, many times--I will just speak \nabout the Homeland Security bill here--the way we will deal \nwith problems we uncover in the hearings or in our inquiries \ninto agency behavior is to tie appropriations to performance. \nWe will say this money will not be released until we get a \nreport on A, B, and C."
"dreier","Mr. Dreier","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    See, I would argue that you are not actually \ngiving up that power, though, because the notion that somehow \nthe Appropriations Committee is just folding is a preposterous \none, because there still is going to be, even though it doesn't \nexist at that moment, you still have that power over the purse, \nas you correctly say, which is there. You are just saying it \nneeds to be done immediately.\n    And I think what Mr. Young and Mr. Whitfield and I are \narguing is that expending more time on this oversight, while \nthey know full well that they are going to have to contend with \nthe question of their funding process through you down the \nroad, I just--I mean you want it to be closer. We are saying \nthat to have a little more leeway would actually enhance the \nfinal product.\n    Mr. Price. Well, all I know is that we have a very full \nhearing schedule on the year that we are appropriating, which \nis every year."
"dreier","Mr. Dreier","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    Right.\n    Mr. Price. I don't think it would be or could be much \nfuller in the off year. And in answer to your question, of \ncourse it makes a difference. If these agencies know that you \nare writing the bill right that minute, and that there are \ngoing to be some things in that bill that they care about in \nterms of conditions they have to meet, performance they have to \ndisplay, or that money simply isn't going to be there, you bet \nthat is more powerful, much more powerful than the implied \nnotion that you might do something about it a year from now."
"foxx","Ms. Foxx","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    Would the gentleman from California yield?"
"dreier","Mr. Dreier","foxx","Ms. Foxx","    Sure. I am happy to yield."
"foxx","Ms. Foxx","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    I thought about saying this even before \nCongressman Price raised the issue of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, but it certainly makes it even more \nrelevant. I have advocated for a long time that we could do a \nmuch better job of oversight of Federal expenditures. And I am \na huge fan of accountability and having results-oriented \nprojects. We could do that if we studied the Constitution a \nlittle more and do what Mr. Young was saying, go back to the \nConstitution and devolve to the States most of what we do in \nthe Federal Government now. We would have plenty of time to do \noversight if we weren't doing education, health care, and all \nof those things that are not mandated for the Congress to do by \nthe Constitution.\n    So if we want to have lots of time to do oversight and lots \nof time to have accountability, then simply get out of doing \nthe things the Constitution doesn't tell us to do. And the \nConstitution does it. We have got the enumerated powers.\n    And then as an added emphasis, the Founders put in the 10th \nAmendment. And they said if we didn't tell you to do it, don't \ndo it. It is up to the States, it is up to the individuals.\n    So, Mr. Price, I think the example you used is a perfect \none to say to us we have no business doing this. We will never \nbe able to give proper oversight as long as we are trying to \nrun every aspect of everyone's lives in this country. And that \nis not what we should be doing. If we would do what the \nConstitution tells us to do, and not go beyond that, or \nextraordinarily carefully go beyond that by things that compel \nus that can't be done by the States, we would be fine in doing \nour oversight.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am sorry, I have to go away for \nanother meeting, but I will return.\n    The Chairman. I thank the gentlewoman."
"dreier","Mr. Dreier","foxx","Ms. Foxx","    Let me just reclaim my time and thank my friend \nfor her thoughtful contribution. And to say, in conclusion, Mr. \nChairman, for this very important panel, and I look forward to \nhearing our other panelists in just a few minutes, that I am--\nagain, I have read about the opposition and concern that has \nbeen raised. And I think that there are valid concerns. And Mr. \nPolis is absolutely right; this is in no way, and I said this \nrepeatedly myself, a panacea. I mean we need to look at this \nvery soberly.\n    I am willing, I don't know that all the cosponsors of my \nlegislation would go along with this, but I am more than \nwilling to look at the idea of exploring something that again \nopponents of biennial budgeting have said is worth exploring, \nand that is maybe building on what Mr. Young talked about in \nhis testimony, maybe having two or three Cabinet-level agencies \nof the Federal Government proceed with a 2-year process to see \nhow it works. Because I know, again, I read the study from the \nNational Council of State Legislatures, and at the end they go \nthrough a litany of those States that have gone from biennial \nto annual back to biennial, biennial back to annual, and they \nhave gone back and forth, back and forth. And some have liked \nit, some haven't liked it. Some have moved just recently to \nbiennial over the last several years.\n    So I mean again, I think that the idea of experimenting \nwith this idea that has emerged from the laboratory, as the \nframers put it, that being the States, is something that I \nwould be willing to support to ensure that we address some of \nthe valid concerns that Mr. Price and others have raised.\n    So thank you very much for that, Mr. Chairman. Thank you \nagain for having this. This is a very important panel, not that \nothers aren't, but to have the wisdom of these three gray-hairs \nis something that I value and appreciate. Thank you, Mr. \nChairman.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Dreier. I earned all the gray \nhair I have got. I too have an opinion about this, which I will \ngive in 1 minute or less, I hope. And that is I believe that \nthis process has given lots of good ideas. I am for \ntransparency; that the American people would see benefit of \nwhat Congress is there and to get their job done. And I think \nwe have heard the gentleman, Mr. Dreier, talk about there would \nbe seen as no advantage to any party, but rather the advantage \nto the American people. I believe that they should have \nconfidence in our system. This is simply an experiment. That is \nall constitutional government is. And if we dwindle down or \ntake advantage of that trust that the public has put us in, \nthen we in fact give away our advantage of a constitutional \ngovernment, the ability to have people have confidence not just \nin what we do, but the outcome therein.\n    When I was in business I used to have a vision statement \nand a mission statement. I haven't spent a lot of time figuring \nit out on this, but I believe the vision statement should be \nwith respect to this that it be for no one's advantage or \ndisadvantage; however, that the American people would have \nconfidence in our work product that we could deliver on a \ntimely basis. And a mission statement should be something to \nenable the government to spend the necessary and needed \nresources to run the government efficiently and to follow the \nConstitution.\n    And I think that we have to transcend where we are, and \nlook at perhaps in a better, brighter way, how we can fix not \njust ourselves, but also look at ourselves at the same time and \nsay we are not in this for power, we are not in this for power \nagainst the President, we are not in this for power against any \nagency, but rather the benefit of commonsense utilization of us \nworking together in at least three sides. There are Republicans \nand Democrats, and then there is just those that vote ``no'' on \neverything. And I think we have to find a way to let the \nAmerican people know that we have accepted this job.\n    All serious daring begins from within us. And that is why \nyou are here. You still share the belief, I am sure, the same \nreason, Bill, when you were elected, David and Ed, and I know \nDavid Dreier shares this. The same spirit that brought him to \nCongress resides deep within him today to make the American \npeople a little bit better.\n    I want to thank each of you for your time today, and I will \ndismiss this group, this panel at this time.\n    I would like to at this time welcome a second panel made up \nof two freshmen who are not only Members of Congress in the \nspirit of constitutional authority, but come, I believe, with \nthe spirit of what brought them here still very alive and burns \ndeeply within them.\n    I would like to, if I can, to have the gentlemen come to \nthe table. First, Congressman Reid Ribble is a Member of the \nHouse Budget Committee and sponsor of H.R. 3577, the Biennial \nBudget and Enhancement Oversight Act of 2011, who along with \nour great Budget Chairman, Paul Ryan from Wisconsin, will push \nthis idea. His legislation shares many of the goals that I \nbelieve Mr. Dreier's bill has before us today.\n    And also the gentleman, Congressman Steve Stivers, who is a \ndistinguished Member of this body, is a member of the Financial \nServices Committee, a bright young voice about ideas that come \nfrom those back home who elected us. He is focused on debt and \ngovernment spending in his first term, and he is a leading \nadvocate for H.R. 114.\n    Without objection, your prepared remarks will be submitted \nto the record. And I welcome your testimony at this time. I \nwould refer first to the gentleman, Mr. Ribble."

"","","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    Mr. Ribble. Okay. Chairman Sessions, Ranking Member Polis, \nand members of the committee, thank you for providing me the \nopportunity to testify today on my legislation, the Biennial \nBudgeting and Enhanced Oversight Act, number H.R. 3577. I \nintroduced this bipartisan bill in December with Chairman Ryan, \nChairman Jeb Hensarling, and several of my colleagues on the \nBudget Committee, including Representatives Marlin Stutzman, \nTodd Rokita, and Frank Guinta. This bill is part of the Budget \nCommittee's broader process reform effort, and it currently has \n30 cosponsors.\n    Before I discuss my bill, I would like to commend Chairman \nDreier, Representative Whitfield, and Representative Timothy \nJohnson for their work on this matter and for putting forth two \nremarkable biennial budgeting bills. I am a proud cosponsor of \nboth of them. The three of us have taken slightly different \napproaches with our legislation, but we all support what is \nimportant: moving to a biennial budgeting process in order to \nfix our broken budget system. I look forward to working with \nthese two gentlemen and others on the committee to reform how \nthe Federal Government spends hardworking taxpayer dollars.\n    I came to Congress just over a year ago with a cynical view \nof this institution. Having spent a year here, I can report \nthat my view hasn't changed much. If anything, I am even a bit \nmore cynical today. It has now been 17 years since Congress \npassed all 12 of its appropriations bills under regular order. \nWe continue to budget and appropriate Federal dollars through \ncontinuing resolutions and omnibuses, failing to allocate \ntaxpayer money in a deliberate way. With our national debt over \n$15.2 trillion, we in Congress cannot afford to treat \nAmericans' tax dollars with such callous disregard.\n    The budget process is the perfect platform to have an \nhonest discussion with the American people about our spending \npriorities. But that discussion does not happen with a broken \nbudget process. To put us on the right track, the Biennial \nBudgeting and Enhanced Oversight Act will help control spending \nby ending the ad hoc budgeting process, while at the same time \nincreasing oversight of how taxpayer dollars are spent.\n    Under my bill, a biennial budget and all appropriations \nbills covering both years in the biennium would be passed in \nthe odd-numbered years. Congress would conduct oversight and \npass multiyear authorization bills in the even-numbered years. \nAuthorization bills would cover no less than 2 years. The basis \nfor my bill was the Spending Deficit and Control Act of 2009, \nas introduced by Chairmen Ryan and Hensarling. This bill \ncontained a number of budget reforms, including a biennial \nbudget.\n    In my bill, the Biennial Budgeting and Enhanced Oversight \nAct, a timetable for the biennial budget and appropriations \nbills would follow the timetable for the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, with Congress being required to complete a \nconcurrent budget resolution by April 15. This would give \nappropriators, I believe, the necessary time to complete their \nwork.\n    The budget timetable is one of the primary differences \nbetween my bill and Chairman Dreier's, and Representative \nWhitfield's bill, as well as Representative Johnson's bill, \nboth of which will push the date back for Congress to finish \naction on the biennial budget from April 15 to May 15. Last \nyear, the House passed our budget on April 15, meeting the \nrequired deadline. While I am sure we on the Budget Committee \nwouldn't mind having more time to do our work, I believe it is \nequally important to give the appropriators ample time to \ncomplete the 12 appropriations bills. By budgeting and \nappropriating in a calmer, wiser way, we could end the threat \nof government shutdowns, with which we all are too familiar.\n    The Biennial Budgeting and Enhanced Oversight Act would \nhelp agencies and businesses to plan their future as well. A \nbiennial budget will allow agencies to plan for multiyear \nprograms and projects, reducing procurement costs. This \napproach will help businesses that work with the various \nagencies and need the certainty that comes from a stable budget \nenvironment. The Federal Government has become adept at \ncreating uncertainty for businesses over the years, and this \nneeds to stop.\n    Prior to coming to Congress, I owned my own roofing company \nfor over 30 years. While I owned my small business, I crafted \n3-year budgets because I needed to plan for the future. By \ndoing this, I was able to buy goods in an orderly manner and \nreduce costs. I would have had a difficult time succeeding had \nI not taken the time to project what my costs would be in the \ncoming months and years and then plan accordingly. If I had run \nmy business the way the Federal Government spends money, \nstumbling from budget to budget, the uncertainty would have \ndecimated my company. This is why I decided to introduce the \nBiennial Budgeting and Enhanced Oversight Act, to try to bring \ncommonsense budgeting practices to Congress.\n    I thank you once again for inviting me to testify at this \nhearing today. I look forward to working with members on the \ncommittee on this very important issue, and I will be happy to \nanswer any questions you have.\n    The Chairman. I appreciate the gentleman from Green Bay \nbeing here this morning and lending his private sector \nexperience to his job and performance in Congress. I want to \nthank you very much."

This bill contained \na number of budget reforms, including moving to a biennial budget. \nUnder my bill, the Biennial Budgeting and Enhanced Oversight Act, the \ntimetable for the biannual budget and appropriation bills would follow \nthe timetable in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, with Congress \nbeing required to complete a concurrent budget resolution by April 15. \nThis would give appropriators, I believe, the necessary time to \ncomplete all of their work.\n    The budget timetable is one of the primary differences between my \nbill and Chairman Dreier's and Representative's Whitfield's bill and \nRepresentative Johnson's bills, both of which push back the date for \nCongress to finish action on the biennial budget from April 15 to May \n15. Last year, the House passed our budget on April 15, meeting the \nrequired deadline. While I'm sure we on the Budget Committee would not \nmind having more time to work, I believe it is equally important to \ngive the appropriators ample time to complete the 12 appropriations \nbills. By budgeting and appropriating in a calmer, wiser way, we could \nend the threat of government shutdowns, with which we all are all too \nfamiliar.\n    The Biennial Budgeting and Enhanced Oversight Act would help \nagencies and businesses to plan for their future as well. A biennial \nbudget will allow agencies to plan for multi-year programs and \nprojects, reducing procurement costs. This approach will help \nbusinesses that work with various agencies and need the certainty that \ncomes from a stable budget environment. The federal government has \nbecome adept at creating uncertainty for businesses over the years, and \nthis needs to stop.\n    Prior to coming to Congress, I owned my own roofing company for \nover 30 years. While I owned my small business, I crafted three year \nbudgets because I needed to plan for the future. By doing this, I was \nable to buy goods in an orderly manner, reducing my costs. I would have \nhad a difficult time succeeding had I not taken the time to project \nwhat my costs would be in the coming months and years and then planned \naccordingly. If I had run my roofing company the way the federal \ngovernment spends money, stumbling from budget to budget, the \nuncertainty would have decimated my company. This is why I decided to \nintroduce the Biennial Budgeting and Enhanced Oversight Act, to try to \nbring common-sense budgeting practices to Congress.\n    I thank you once again for inviting me to testify at this hearing \ntoday. I look forward to working with Members on this Committee on this \nimportant issue, and I will be happy to answer any questions you may \nhave."

break,break,break,break,break
"","","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    Mr. Stivers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank \nChairman Sessions and Ranking Member Polis for allowing me to \ntestify. I would also like to thank Chairman Dreier and \nRepresentative Whitfield for their work on H.R. 114, and \nRepresentative Ribble for his work on H.R. 3577. I am a \ncosponsor of both bills.\n    Just as a matter of background, before I came to Congress I \nwas a State senator for 6 years in Ohio, where we have a \nbiennial budget. I was vice chair of the Finance Committee in \nOhio, which has the same jurisdiction as the Budget Committee \nand the Appropriations Committee rolled into one in Ohio. So I \nhave some background working with biennial budgets. And I can \ntell you from a perspective as somebody who has done it in a \nState that is fairly large and complex with a $50 billion 2-\nyear biennial budget, it can be done, and there are advantages.\n    And I have looked at some of the background from some of \nthe folks who oppose this as well. And they talk about some of \nthe planning and other problems. I did not experience any of \nthose. I did experience that it worked. Ohio balanced its \nbudget. Ohio made tough choices.\n    You know our current budget process here in Washington is \nbroken. And I think that is evidenced by the fact that we \nhaven't had a budget for a thousand days. We have been \noperating under continuing resolutions for multiple years. And \nthe last time that the budget process worked as it was \nscheduled to was fiscal year 1997. So just as a way of looking \nback, that was 15 years ago, and I was 31 years old at the \ntime. All of us were a lot younger back then. But that is a \nlong time for the process not to work.\n    Even before I came to Congress, I advocated for a biennial \nbudget. And I think that the bill that Chairman Dreier and \nRepresentative Whitfield sponsored would fix the process, \nalthough not be a panacea.\n    As I said, in Ohio we have a biennial budget. Nineteen \nStates have biennial budgets, including Ohio and Texas, that \nare fairly large and complex. You know, in the first year of \nthat biennial budget, Ohio passes the budget. In the second \nyear, the Finance Committee focuses on oversight. There usually \nis a budget corrections bill which we would probably call a \nsupplemental here. But in fact, it does give the Finance \nCommittee in Ohio time to do the oversight of the important \nState agencies. And that would happen here at the Federal \nGovernment as well. And, you know, just like at the Federal \nGovernment, that State budget is broken into two separate \nannual budgets, but we passed the biennial budget and it works. \nI think it has created sound fiscal policy in Ohio, and it has \nworked for decades.\n    It does decrease the opportunity for politics to override \npolicy decisions, in my opinion. And I think H.R. 114 and 3577 \nlay out that fiscally sound path. I don't think it would shift \npower between the administration and the Congress.\n    I would love to address Congressman Polis' question, if he \ngets a chance to ask it again. And I think if we look at the \nrecord of Congress as an institution since the Budget Act of \n1974, Congress has only met its responsibility under the Budget \nAct 17 percent of the time. And so I don't think that we could \nmake it much worse than it is today.\n    You know, I did think it was interesting, Chairman Dreier \ntalked about maybe a hybrid system for a little while to put \nthem next to each other. I think that would be an interesting \nthing. And I think there is nothing wrong with trying some new \nthings. When you are succeeding 17 percent of the time, in any \nother business that would not be good. In the business of \ngovernment, unfortunately, we put up with it far too long. But \nI am glad to hear that there are a lot of people really looking \nat it.\n    I do think that biennial budgeting does lead to business \nsavvy, just as Representative Ribble talked about, because you \ncan lock in longer term contracts. I know that that was \ndiscussed on the previous panel, too. And I think that gets \nbetter deals for taxpayers in the long run. It does require \nlooking ahead a little further. I know the biennial budget \ngroup talked about they were concerned that you would have to \nlook ahead 30 months. Well, I would be concerned about any \nentity that can't look forward 30 months.\n    And will it be perfect? No. In the budget projections that \nwe have in Ohio in our experience are not perfect, but they \nwork, and at the end of the biennium we balance the budget. So \nit does require some work in the second year, but, you know, I \ndon't think the appropriators would have a problem with working \nin the second year. They are doing it now, and I think we can \nmake that work.\n    You know, the other thing that some people bring up is, you \nknow, there might be a loss of ability to respond to natural \ndisasters, national security, or other events. There is nothing \nin a biennial budget that prevents supplemental or budget \ncorrection bills, just like we do today. I don't think they are \nany more prevalent than they would be in an annual \nappropriations process.\n    And of course let's again bring out that the annual \nappropriations process is broken. We end up with continuing \nresolutions more often than not, where we don't actually set \nthe budget priorities, but we just continue on the spending \ndecisions of previous Congresses. And I don't think that is \ngood for the people or our Republic. So while I don't think \nbiennial budgeting is a panacea, I do think it is a step in the \nright direction, and I think it can give us another tool in the \ntoolbox that will work. It has worked in the States, including \nmy home State of Ohio, where I have experience. And I hope we \nwill continue to look at it in some form or another.\n    And I don't claim to come here with all the answers to all \nthe questions, but if we can work together I think we can find \na process that will actually be good for our Republic, good for \nour taxpayers. And I don't think it is about not parading our \nfailures in front of folks, I think it is about moving toward \nsuccess. And that is what we should be about. And when our \nsuccess rate is 17 percent on budgeting, successfully \ncompleting the required tasks in the 1974 Budget Act, that is \nnothing to brag about. And I think there are things we can do \nto fix it, and I think this is one.\n    Again, I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member \nfor allowing me to testify. I look forward to answering any of \nthe questions that any members may have."

"","","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    I would like to thank Chairman Pete Sessions (R-TX) and Ranking \nMember Jared Polis (D-CO) for holding this hearing on biennial \nbudgeting today, and appreciate this discussion on ways we can make the \nFederal government fiscally sound. Additionally, I would like to thank \nChairman David Dreier (R-CA) and Representative Ed Whitfield (R-KY) for \ntheir leadership on H.R. 114, the Biennial Budgeting and Appropriations \nAct of 2011.\n    Since coming to Congress last year, I have been working with \nChairman Dreier and Representative Whitfield to reform our budget \nprocess and explain the merits of biennial budgeting and how this \nreform would improve the current Congressional budget process.\n    The current budget process is completely broken. As you may know, \ntoday marks 1,000 days since the Senate has passed a budget. This \nfailure and Congress' inability to pass appropriations legislation in \nregular order shows that the Congressional budget process needs reform. \nFiscal Year 1997 was the last year Congress passed appropriations in \nregular order.\n    Before coming to Congress, I advocated for a biennial budget. As an \nOhio State Senator and Vice Chair of the Finance Committee, I had time \nto extensively review the state budget given the two-year budget cycle. \nOhio is one of 19 states that operate on a biennial budget, and Texas \nand Ohio are two examples of large states with complex budgets that use \nbiennial budgeting.\n    In Ohio, the biennium begins on July 1 of odd-numbered years and \nends 24 months later on June 30. Within a biennium are two separate \nfiscal years, each beginning on July 1 and ending on June 30. This two-\nyear budget process in Ohio has allowed for long-term planning of state \nprograms and has decreased opportunities for politics to override sound \nfiscal policy decisions.\n    In the current budget process, Congress has only met its \nresponsibility to pass appropriations in a regular order 17 percent of \nthe time--17 percent is simply not good enough. Under H.R. 114, \nCongress would be spending the second session of Congress reviewing \nexpired laws, and conducting aggressive oversight of federal programs \nto ensure taxpayer dollars are spent efficiently and effectively.\n    Biennial budgeting is also business savvy, as it allows the federal \ngovernment to procure contracts with private companies and venders in \ntwo-year increments potentially increasing the federal government's \nability to lock in the best deal for the taxpayer.\n    I also want to point out that when Congress needs to act in \nresponse to a natural disaster, national security threat or war, H.R. \n114 also includes provisions that will allow Congress to act swiftly.\n    Mr. Chairman, I believe the Ohio experience with the two-year \nbudget has been successful, and a biennial budget at the federal level \nwould be a useful tool in our continued efforts to cut wasteful \ngovernment spending. Biennial budgeting is not a panacea, but it is a \nstep in the right direction. Again, I thank the Chairman for this \ndialogue as we work to improve the federal budget process."

"","","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    The Chairman. Your voices, strong as they are today, it is \nmy hope that you will not have to look back 10 or 12 or 15 \nyears, as our previous panel did, and say I gave testimony 15 \nor 17 years ago about this idea. I think your ideas are very \nappropriate for today. And so keep your words today, and let's \nsee if we can move this idea along.\n    Mr. Dreier."
"dreier","Mr. Dreier","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And let me \njust express my appreciation to Messrs. Ribble and Stivers, \nboth of whom as new Members bring a very important perspective. \nThe perspective of the private sector that you bring, Mr. \nRibble, is an important one. And as a senator in that \nlaboratory of ideas, as I mentioned earlier, as the Framers put \nit, of a State that has taken this issue on and done so with a \ngreat deal of success is something that I hope we can learn \nfrom here. I would like to think that the legislation that we \nput together does allow us to do that, and I appreciate your \nsupport for the idea of our doing what opponents to biennial \nbudgeting have said we ought to explore, and that is the notion \nof taking some incremental steps on the road towards laying the \ngroundwork to see if in fact it is successful. And some of the \nquestions that are out there that I recognize are more than \nvalid can be addressed in some ways.\n    So I just again thank you both for being enthusiastic, \nhardworking, diligent champions of the goal that we all in a \nbipartisan way share, and that is to make this institution more \nresponsive and representative to the will of the people to get \nour fiscal House in order, and to do the right thing on behalf \nof the people whom we represent. So thank you very much.\n    Mr. Stivers. And Mr. Price did mention earlier that we do \nthat in some cases now on multiyear budgeting. We need to do a \nbetter job of doing that I think. And I believe it would work \neverywhere. But if we want to look a few places to start and \nthen compare to see the 2-year process versus the 1-year \nprocess, I think that is a great first step."
"dreier","Mr. Dreier","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    Great. Great. Thanks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Good point. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Mr. Polis."
"polis","Mr. Polis","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    Yes, just a brief statement. I know that Mr. \nRibble mentioned that his roofing company had 3-year budgets. \nAnd in my private sector experience in the technology sector \nand startups, 1-year budgeting is more the norm. Those are \nearly stage growth start-up companies. Obviously, when you have \nlarger enterprises that are more predictable, you can move to \nmultiyear budgeting.\n    But there is no--just as we have in the public sector \nbetween the States, some States that have 1-year and some that \nhave 2-year, I think in the private sector as well, you find a \nwide array of different kinds of companies. And it usually \nmakes sense to come up with what best suits that company.\n    So it is really a discussion for what best suits the \nFederal Government. And certainly we all agree it is better to \nsucceed in the process, whether you do it annually or \nbiennially. But it has been very informative to hear some of \nthe merits of doing it biennally. I yield back.\n    The Chairman. Thank you very much. I want to thank both of \nyou for not only sharing your ideas, but taking your time in a \nvery busy day that I know today represents, with the President \nof the United States will be before the United States Congress, \na joint session of Congress and the American people to talk \nabout his priorities for the new year. And perhaps none are \nmore important than the budget which the President and this \nCongress do present to the American people, which lay out the \nresponsibilities of government to produce things for the \nAmerican people.\n    I want to thank both of you for being here today. I think \nyou have been value added, and I appreciate you taking time do \nthis. This panel is now excused.\n    Mr. Stivers. Mr. Chairman, is there any chance I could \nrespond to something that Mr. Price said earlier about Homeland \nSecurity in the context that Mr. Polis talked about?\n    The Chairman. I would welcome the gentleman's comment.\n    Mr. Stivers. He did talk about when they stood up the \nHomeland Security Department, how important it was for some of \nthat give and take early on.\n    Mr. Polis just referred to when he started up--was it Green \nMountain Greetings or whatever, I apologize."
"polis","Mr. Polis","polis","Mr. Polis","    Blue Mountain.\n    Mr. Stivers. Blue Mountain Greetings, I am sorry, wrong \ncolor. But startups obviously do require a little more \nattention. And annual appropriations on things like Homeland \nSecurity that we are just starting up, I don't have a problem \nwith. But the Federal Government is a very complex, large \norganization that has multiyear budget processes in place for \nmost of these departments already. So I think moving to a \nbiennial budget for most of the Federal Government, you know--\nthe Federal Government is not really a start-up. It is hard for \nus to say that after 230 years. But I do think that most of the \nFederal Government would be fairly simple to move to a biennial \nprocess, although I certainly understand that there are \nopponents who think the benefits aren't there.\n    But I would love to at least try to move some agencies, \nincluding the Defense Department, which has a lot of issues \nwith appropriations for technology, and for contracts for \nbuilding systems, moving some of those large, more complex \ndepartments to a multiyear, much more stable appropriations \nprocess, I think there would be some real value to starting \nthere."
"polis","Mr. Polis","polis","Mr. Polis","    Could I have more time for a follow-up question?\n    The Chairman. Sure."
"polis","Mr. Polis","polis","Mr. Polis","    Along those lines, aren't there times in fact \nwhen there are savings that can be recognized from the \npredictability? I mean when you have contracts that may or may \nnot go on, and they are kind of artificially across the year, \nsometimes there are additional premiums built into work that \nothers are doing for the Federal Government as a result of 1-\nyear budgeting? Is that an issue that you see?\n    Mr. Stivers. Yes, sir. And we have seen that in the Defense \nDepartment a lot, and in a lot of the acquisitions processes. \nIf it goes across a Federal appropriations year, then usually \nthere are added costs built in because of the uncertainty. And \nin fact, it is public information, you can see that, where the \ncontractors build in costs because of the uncertainty of the \nappropriations years crossing over. So I think the multiyear \nprocess could save some money. And that is not, again, going to \nhappen in every case, but it could really save some money. So I \nappreciate the question.\n    The Chairman. Perhaps for sure it would stop what the \ntestimony earlier--the starting and stopping, starting and \nstopping, as Congress does its job, and with more \npredictability to the success. Good. Thank you very much. I \nwant to thank both of you, and dismiss this panel at this time.\n    Our third panel that we have today is from a distinguished \ngroup that we have tried to gather together here for this \nhearing. And I want to welcome Maya MacGuineas and Scott Lilly.\n    Maya MacGuineas is president of the Committee for a \nResponsible Federal Budget, and director of the Fiscal Policy \nProgram at the New America Foundation. Her areas of expertise \ninclude the budget, entitlements, and tax policy. Before coming \nto the New America Foundation, Maya worked as a Social Security \nadviser to the McCain Presidential campaign. Prior to that, she \nworked at the Brookings Institute, Concord Coalition, and on \nWall Street.\n    And Scott Lilly--who I welcomed earlier when he walked in \ntoday, Scott, welcome. Chairman Dreier and I and Mr. Polis are \ndelighted that you are here also--is a senior fellow at the \nCenter for American Progress who writes and researches on a \nwide range of areas, including government, Federal budgeting, \nnational security, and the economy. He joined the Center in \nMarch of 2004, after 31 years of service to this body, the \nUnited States Congress. He served as a clerk and staff director \nfor the House Appropriations Committee, minority staff director \nof that committee, executive director of the House Democrat \nStudy Group, executive director of the Joint Economic \nCommittee, and chief of staff to the gentleman who has just \nretired, the gentleman David Obey, who was a regular visitor \nhere.

"","","polis","Mr. Polis","    Ms. MacGuineas. Thank you. Thank you for having me here \ntoday. I am happy to testify on biennial budgeting and \nimproving the budget process overall. I am the president of the \nCommittee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which is a \nbipartisan organization. And our co-chairs are former Members \nFrenzel, Stenholm, Penny, and Nussle. And we have a board of \npeople who have run OMB, and CBO, and the Fed and Treasury.\n    We also work on something called the Peterson-Pew \nCommission on Budget Reform, which came up with a number of \nrecommendations. In the past we supported biennial budgeting, \nalong with a lot of other budget reforms. Recently we have been \nfocusing on how to come up with fiscal targets, filling that in \nwith policy plans and triggers in order to keep the budget \nreforms in place.\n    So I share the belief, as I assume many of you do, that our \nbudget process certainly needs major reform, that an improved \nprocess can both help force and enforce improved actions, and \nthat process reforms are not a silver bullet with regard to \nfixing our looming fiscal crisis. So the only way we are going \nto fix that is if we put in place a large and comprehensive \nfiscal plan which addresses our major fiscal challenges. And \nthe sooner we enact such a plan, the better it would be for the \nfiscal and economic well-being of the U.S.\n    But not only are our policies off track, our process is \ncertainly broken and a mess. Deadlines exist in name only in \nmany instances. Appropriations continuously fall behind \nschedule, leading to unwanted mini- and omnibuses. Gimmicks are \nregularly employed. And these problems only exist for the small \nportion of the budget that lawmakers annually mark up. The vast \nmajority of our spending and tax policies are really on \nautopilot, leading to a system where our national priorities \nare neither fully thought out nor fully funded.\n    So today's hearing is specifically on biennial budgeting, \nwhich we support. Biennial budgeting would give Congress \nadditional time for evaluation and oversight. Fixing our fiscal \nproblems will require going through our spending and tax \npolicies with a fine-tooth comb and determining what works, \nwhat could work better, and what does not work.\n    In addition to giving additional time, Congress would have \nmore of an ability to conduct the type of needed oversights and \nwork them into the budget process. Right now we collect an \nawful lot of information through evaluation and oversight, but \nit isn't really incorporated into the entire budget process. So \nin a time of limited resources, this will all become essential. \nAnd we just cannot afford wasteful spending when we are being \nforced to cut back on priority spending and increase revenues. \nA longer process would also provide more of the stability that \nwe certainly need in our budgetary environments.\n    We should also consider--and this is something we have \nrecommended in our recent reports--multiyear budgeting, in that \nright now the country really does need a fiscal plan that will \nget us to sustainable debt levels. That is going to take \ncertainly a decade, if not more, to bring us back to, say, the \nneighborhood of the mid-sixties debt to GDP, and then over time \nback to our traditional levels of below 40 percent of GDP.\n    Given that so much of the purpose of putting in place a \nmultiyear plan is to reassure markets, and provide economic \nstability, you need to know that any budget reforms that we put \nin place will actually stay on track. And so we want to find as \nmany ways to make these reforms credible and enforceable, and \nprovide the needed stability and security to the markets, to \nbusinesses, to households, and to policymakers.\n    We also know that we are going to want to put a multiyear \nfiscal plan in place immediately, and allow many of the changes \nto phase in more gradually. So you put them in place now, you \nbudget for them, but you give them time to make changes.\n    So we basically, bottom line, have always supported \nbiennial budgeting. We think that in many ways 2 years would \nhelp recognize the shortcomings.\n    I am very encouraged to hear in the discussion today the \nopenness of sort of trying this out in incremental or different \nways and seeing if it works. Because I don't think anybody \nthinks this is going to be the cure-all to any of the budgetary \nproblems, but it certainly has the ability to make \nimprovements, particularly in the oversight area. And giving \nthat a try in some areas makes an awful lot of sense to me.\n    I also find something very appealing about an idea that \ndoes have widespread bipartisan support. And I have had the \nchance to testify in the Senate as well, and seeing how many \nMembers have come on board to this idea. And I think there is \nsomething to be said for moving forward with things that do \nhave bipartisan support in this very tough area of budget and \nfiscal reforms.\n    So I would conclude by reiterating how much of our current \nbudget process is really failing the American people. We have \nnearly a dozen short-term continuing resolutions, we have had \nthem over the past 2 years. This is no way to inspire \nconfidence in Washington's ability to effectively govern at a \ntime where we so desperately do need to have confidence that we \ncan. The instability doesn't even stop there. There is still no \nconsensus on other budgetary matters such as expiring and \nexpired tax extenders, the doc fix, the AMT, the payroll tax \nholiday, the sequester, the tax cuts. We need to find a way to \nput more stability into this process, along with the necessary \nbudget improvements for the fiscal situation.\n    So there is no question that when it comes to the budget \nthere is an awful lot of work to be done. And I applaud the \ncommittee and the sponsors of this legislation for looking into \nbiennial budgeting as one of those possible improvements. Thank \nyou for inviting me today.\n    The Chairman. Maya, thank you very much."

"","","polis","Mr. Polis","    Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee. Thank you \nfor the opportunity to testify today on the important topic of fixing \nthe budget process. It is a privilege to appear before the committee.\n    I am the President of the Committee for a Responsible Federal \nBudget. Our Co-Chairs are Bill Frenzel, Jim Nussle, Tim Penny and \nCharlie Stenholm, and our Board is comprised of many of the past \nDirectors of the Office of Management and Budget, the Congressional \nBudget Office and the Chairs of the Federal Reserve Board and the House \nand Senate Budget Committees. I was also a member of the Peterson-Pew \nCommission on Budget Reform, which spent three years developing a \ncollection of recommendations to reform the budget process, which can \nbe a helpful component in overcoming our fiscal challenges. The \nCommission released a plethora of papers and two reports--Red Ink \nRising and Getting Back in the Black that focused on the need to adopt \nmulti-year budgetary targets, automatic triggers as well as many other \nbudgetary reforms.\n    I share a belief with many of you and other members of Congress \nthat (1) our budget process needs major improvements; (2) an improved \nprocess can both help force and enforce better policies; and (3) \nprocess reform is not a silver bullet with regard to fixing our looming \nfiscal crisis, but it can help. The only way to fix that is to put in \nplace a large, comprehensive fiscal plan addressing our major fiscal \nchallenges, and the sooner we enact such a plan, the better it will be \nfor the fiscal and economic wellbeing of the United States.\n    Our budget process is just not working. Deadlines exist in name \nonly; appropriations continuously fall behind schedule leading to \nunwanted mini and omnibus legislation, and gimmicks are regularly \nemployed. And these problems only exist for the small portion of the \nbudget that lawmakers annually mark up and decide. The vast majority of \nour spending and tax policies are on autopilot, leading to a system \nwhere our national priorities are neither fully thought out nor fully \nfunded.\n    The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and the Peterson-Pew \nCommission have crafted a number of budget reform recommendations, \nwhich we call the 3-Ts of Targets, Triggers and Transparency, which we \nbelieve would enhance the current budget process. Among these are:\n    <bullet>  Setting a medium-term debt target and a glide path of \nannual debt and savings targets to achieve it.\n    <bullet>  Using broad-based budget triggers with no programmatic \nexemptions to ensure that targets are met.\n    <bullet>  Following the enactment of a deficit reduction plan to \nstabilize the debt, using additional triggers and spending and tax \nexpenditure caps to keep any plan on track.\n    <bullet>  Requiring the President to issue annual progress reports \non the effects of all newly issued legislation and progress towards \nlonger-term fiscal goals.\n    <bullet>  Presenting new budget allocations compared to the \nprevious year's levels as well as other baselines Reforming the way for \nwhich emergencies are budgeted.\n    <bullet>  Presenting tax expenditures by area alongside other \nspending in the same categories.\n    <bullet>  Increasing the level of scrutiny and oversight on tax \nexpenditures.\n    Today's hearing is more specifically about the budget reform known \nas biennial budgeting, a reform that the Committee for a Responsible \nFederal Budget supports. I will also spend some time speaking about an \nextension of this policy, multi-year budgeting, something the Committee \nfinds particularly important right now.\n    H.R. 114, the specific bill we are discussing today, would move the \ndiscretionary budget from an annual appropriations cycle to a two-year \nbudget cycle. The most popular argument in support of such a regime \nwould be the additional time Congress would now have freed up to \nconduct other business--from additional program review and evaluation \nto a more careful look at our budget and budget programs currently on \nauto-pilot. Fixing our fiscal problems will require going through our \nspending and tax policies with a fine-toothed comb and determining what \nworks, what could worked better, and what does not work. If given \nadditional time, Congress would have more ability to conduct this type \nof needed oversight. In a time of limited resources, this becomes \nessential--we cannot afford wasteful spending when we are being forced \nto cut back on priority spending and/or raising taxes.\n    Over the years, Congress has mandated that agencies collect a \nsignificant amount of data to develop and track performance metrics. \nHowever, because of the compressed schedule and political realities, \nthe budget is more and more rushed and legislators have less and less \ntime to adequately use the wealth of data they receive to better align \nthe nation's priorities with what programs we choose to fund and to \nremove waste and create efficiencies. Moving to a biennial system would \ngive members an entire year to better conduct program evaluation and \nbetter set spending and tax levels. Members would then have more time \nto find under-performing or duplicative programs and eliminate or \nreform them, or even find over-performing programs and allocate \nadditional funds.\n    At the same time, a two-year cycle would give the executive branch \nand its agencies more time to craft their budgets. Adding an additional \nyear would allow these agencies to operate on a more stable funding \nground, preventing un-needed payments for fear of reductions in the \nfollowing year's budget, and by allowing better longer-term planning. \nMuch like how families and businesses would appreciate the stability \nadded by having more certain taxing and spending policies (instead of \nthe current system of short-term extensions, and the fear of looming \ntax increases and spending cuts created by the lack of a multi-year \nbudget), giving additional time would add stability to executive \nplanning.\n    Biennial budgeting is not without its flaws, though. There are a \nnumber of fears that go along with this reform, not unlike any specific \nreform policy, as this is not a silver bullet. From a legislator's \nperspective, moving to a two-year cycle would mean fewer times agency \nheads would have to justify their appropriations. Thus, agencies might \nbe less accountable to Congress.\n    Additionally, there are real questions as to how biennial budgeting \nwould work in practice-would the old annual appropriations process \ncontinue to exist because of a surge in supplemental appropriations \nbills? This is a real concern and it would require political will to \nprevent this from occurring. While supplemental funding bills are \nsometimes necessary due to the nature of government and the need to \nrespond to emergencies or unforeseen events, creating a new budget \ncycle to see it exist in name only due to appropriators' desire to stay \non a de-facto one year cycle would in fact only create more havoc and \nless stability. This could be avoided through more stringent \ndefinitions of what constitutes emergency spending and what could be \npart of a supplemental, or through other budget reforms.\n    Some of the budgeting work for the next nine years has already been \ndone through the passage of the discretionary caps seen in the Budget \nControl Act. There is, in fact, no need for a top line discretionary \nfunding level to be agreed to legally if the caps are followed--which \nis not to say that this Congress, or future Congresses, cannot change \nthese levels. Nevertheless, adoption of these levels has removed a \nlarge part of the annual budget work and has added another impetus to \nmove away from the annual system.\n    I would now like to highlight what I believe are some of the things \nthat can be done with an additional year of budgeting within a two-year \ncycle.\n    As intimated previously, one possible use of Congress' time in \nlight of a biennial regime would be increased oversight and exploration \nof federal programs, the tax code and possible waste and inefficiencies \nall related to the budget. But beyond that, one possible thing that we \nat the Committee have long supported would be to create a budget \nconcepts commission. Such a commission would look into a number of \nissues, including many of those I mentioned earlier in my remarks, such \nas better accounting, particularly for long-term spending programs, \nfiscal exposures, insurance programs, and programs that are intended to \nbe pre-funded; improving the construction and use of budget baselines; \ncapital budgeting and dynamic scoring issues; tax expenditures; \naccounting for private securities; leasing and public-private \npartnerships; and trust funds. As the nature of budgeting continues to \nevolve, a freestanding budget concepts commission would likely prove \nimmensely beneficial.\n    A second possible or additional matter Congress could address with \nadditional time is a more careful review of national priorities. \nCongress could conduct a more detailed analysis of our taxing and \nspending policies and rank them versus what our national needs. This \nbudget concept is known in other countries as portfolio budgeting and \nwould focus on connecting the entire budget and tax programs with their \nintended objective. Time would be devoted towards ranking the programs, \nand the corresponding national priorities, to reflect what should be \ntaxed and how much as each objective spending program receives. This \nwould allow lawmakers more ability to have a transparent budget process \nover what the priorities are and how best to achieve them.\n    Related to this would be using the off years to engage in broader \nstrategic planning for the nation. As of now, we do not have a national \nfiscal roadmap and no broader strategic path. We could use this time to \nidentify long, medium and short-term strategic goals, take note of \nthreats and new opportunities, political and economic changes etc. This \nwould help guide policymakers as they hopefully engage in a more \nthoughtful budget process and allow them to take a step back on a \nregular basis from the nuts and bolts aspects of crafting a national \nbudget. Not only do we not have a strategic plan, but we seem to be \noperating in the opposite with constant short-term measures, extenders \nand a never-ending political fight.\n    And finally, we could produce topical reports about the fiscal \nhealth of the country. Australia issues its Intergenerational Report \nevery five years, which assess the implications of current policies \nover a longer time horizon and looks at the effects of demographic \nchange on economic growth. Past efforts in the United States to \nintegrate generational accounting have been, while technically \nchallenging, extremely illuminating. A deeper dive into topics such as \nthe interconnectedness between federal, state, and local budgets or \nfiscal exposures due to contingent liabilities and implicit budget \ncommitments would be immensely useful in identifying, and hopefully \navoiding, future budgetary challenges. Rising Medicaid costs, increased \nstate pension liabilities and local government bankruptcies have the \npotential to impact the federal fiscal outlook-preparing for these \nevents would lessen the negative consequences and all the federal \ngovernment to better respond. Overall, there are numerous beneficial \nuses the additional time allowed would provide if the federal \ngovernment moved to a two year cycle.\n    Related to biennial budgeting, but with significantly more upside, \nwould be to develop a multi-year budget--something I'd like to take \nsome time to discuss. Right now the country needs a fiscal plan to get \nus to a sustainable debt level with the debt on a declining path \nrelative to the economy. Such a plan will probably need to span a full \ndecade, which is a reasonable amount of time to make progress on \nreducing the debt to around 65 percent of GDP--though beyond that, we \nneed to continue to make changes to bring it back closer to its \nhistorical level of below 40 percent. Ideally, we would put such a plan \nin place immediately and allow many of the changes to phase-in more \ngradually both to allow people to adjust as needed and to allow the \neconomy to continue to recover. But in order to be credible, there has \nto be a real commitment to sticking to the plan in subsequent years. So \nif such a multi-year plan is adopted as so many fiscal experts have \nrecommended, the policy then should be to assume that ten-year plan \nremains in place for the decade, though with enough flexibility to make \nnecessary changes along the way to account for external changes that \narise without derailing the overall glide path to an improved fiscal \nsituation. One of the purposes of putting a plan in place is to \nreassure credit markets and rating agencies, and provide families and \nbusinesses with the stability they need to plan, invest, and help grow \nthe economy. If this plan is seen as something that can be changed \ndramatically year-to-year, it will not provide that security or \nstability.\n    Therefore, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has been \nfocused on how to put a multi-year budget plan in place, as well as \nincorporate the necessary enforcement mechanism to keep such a plan in \nplace. Besides adding the desperately needed stability, multi-year \nplans have the advantage of becoming the de-facto budget--they stay in \nplace until an entirely new multi-year budget is agreed upon. As a \nresult, our current practice of constantly missing deadlines, endless \nextensions, consistent fears of a government shut-down and the specter \nof a fiscal crisis, would end.\n    Nevertheless, I must emphasize that while I am fully in favor of \nbudget process reforms that move the process in a more positive \ndirection, they are in no way a replacement for the tough budget policy \nchoices that have to be made. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit \nReduction failed in making these tough choices, and we now have a $1.2 \ntrillion spending trigger that is set to go off January 1st of next \nyear--something some are discussing ways to turn off with no \ncorresponding savings. Turning off the trigger completely would send a \nsignal to markets and the American people that Washington is unwilling \nto make any tough choices--it might even risk another downgrade. Even \nwith savings equal to the trigger, though, that will be insufficient to \nprevent debt from continuing to rise as share of the economy this \ndecade, and particularly insufficient to stabilize long-term debt based \non our current trajectory. We need to focus on the largest problems in \nthe budget, particularly entitlement spending on health care and \nretirement and an outdated and inefficient tax code, and come up with \nlarger savings in order to bring the debt down to sustainable levels.\n    While fixing our broken budget process would certainly help achieve \nthese goals and are critical to making them stick, the actual decisions \nmade on policy choices regarding what and how much spending to cut and \nwhat and how much revenue to raise are the only ways to actually fix \nthe real problems with our budget.\n    I would like to conclude by once again reiterating how much our \ncurrent budget process is failing the American people. We have had \nnearly a dozen sort-term continuing resolutions over the past two \nyears--this is no way to inspire confidence in Washington's ability to \neffectively govern or in the fiscal policies that will be in place \ngoing forward. This adds significant instability to the economy at a \ntime when the recovery is still fragile. But the instability doesn't \nstop there. There is still no consensus on other budgetary matters, \nsuch as expiring and expired tax extenders, the `doc fix', the \nalternative minimum tax, the payroll tax holiday, the sequester and the \nlooming 2001/2003/2010 tax cut expiration. If moving to a biennial \nsystem gives the added time needed to focus on important fiscal \npolicies decisions, then we should move to it. Because we need a better \nprocess so we all can better serve the American people and also help \nour economy, we need a multi-year fiscal plan to address our fiscal \nissues.\n    Relying on a more rational timeframe for budgeting is one of the \nprocess changes we believe will have positive results. Accordingly, \nwhile I would urge Congress not to focus on process as a replacement \nfor policy, biennial budgeting or multi-year budgeting would be a \nuseful tool in helping to deal with America's significant budgetary and \nfiscal challenges.\n    Thank you again for the to testify today and to the many members of \nthis Committee for your leadership on these critical issues. I look \nforward to your questions."

"","","polis","Mr. Polis","    Mr. Lilly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, Ranking \nMember. I guess I am going to try to build on what Dave Price \nsaid earlier. I find some aspects of a biennial budget \nattractive, but I find the downsides much more unattractive.\n    I have got three basic points I want to make. The first is \nthat biennial budgeting will not help ease gridlock. There are \ntwo basic things that are driving the gridlock that we have in \nthis institution. I would say that there have been several \nreferences to the last time we passed all the appropriations \nbills on time. In 1996, Bill Livingstone was able to get an \nomnibus approps bill in at the end of September, which \nPresident Clinton signed in October, a couple weeks into the \nfiscal year. The only time in the last 60 years that we have \npassed all 13 bills independently and had them signed into law \nat the beginning of the fiscal year was in 1994. And I was \nclerk of the Appropriations Committee when that happened. So I \nknow what kind of a struggle it is. And I also have a real \nappreciation of how important it is to give agencies the time \nto effectively obligate funds.\n    But having said that, I think what makes it impossible for \nthe people who run the Appropriations Committee today to meet \nthat standard is the very deep ideological divide in this \ninstitution. You have got about half of the House and half of \nthe Senate that want to significantly reduce government, and \nanother half that do not. And that is not something that \nprocess can solve. I think biennial budgeting simply ups the \nstakes and makes compromise more difficult.\n    Very often when we have had trouble moving appropriations \nbills, we agree to a shorter time frame in order to get a \ngreater consensus and more time to argue, more time to resolve \ndifferences. There is no question in my mind that that is what \nwould happen with this. A 2-year appropriation is much higher \nstakes than a 1-year appropriation. Furthermore, there is a lot \nmore time to maneuver. If it is for 2 years and you end up \narguing for the first 12 months of the 2 years, you really \ndon't hit the brick wall. Repeatedly, there has been an attempt \nto move the brick walls that the legislative process faces in \norder to resolve timing differences. That almost never works \nbecause it is the brick wall that causes Congress to ultimately \nact. And I think that is what you face here.\n    The second thing that I think, and I am amazed that this \ndiscussion hasn't gotten into this, the real problem with \nappropriations through the years has not been in the House at \nall. Even when the House had less ideological divisions, it has \nbeen the Senate that has failed to act. Time and time again, \nChairman Young and Chairman Lewis were able to move all of the \nappropriations bills through the House in the month of June, or \nat least by the middle of July, only to have them languish for \nmonths and months in the Senate.\n    Now, the perfect example of why that happens is the 2010 \nenergy and water appropriations bill. The bill passed the House \noverwhelmingly, went to the Senate with broad support, \nattempted to bring it up, there was a hold placed on it. The \nmajority leader tried repeatedly to get the hold lifted. \nFinally, at the end of July, just before the August recess, \nfiled cloture, was able to wait the amount of time and collect \nthe number of votes to move that bill, which then passed 85 to \n7.\n    Now, if you have that repeatedly you just simply can't get \nthe bills through. And that is, with the leadership of both \nparties in the Senate, the problem they face. They cannot move \nlegislation. This has always been possible under the Senate \nrules. But until the last decade, it was never practiced. So \nunless the Senate changes those rules--and I did a proposal \nlast year for different Senate rules--no matter what the House \ndoes, you are going to end up languishing appropriations bills \nand not acting. And it will only be when you have finally hit \nthe final end that the Senate will turn around and say, okay, \nwe didn't bring these bills up, but we will agree to an omnibus \nthat we put together. And I think you just have to face that \nproblem.\n    And I think it is destructive to reaching a solution to \nthat problem to pretend like there is another problem. There \nisn't another problem. It is the failure of the Senate rules to \nallow the Senate to act in an expeditious manner.\n    Now, the second thing I think is important here is we don't \nhave enough information to reliably make intelligent decisions \nabout spending levels this far out. Let me give you an example. \nWe are going to start spring training in about 3 weeks with the \npitchers and catchers reporting. That is about the same time \nthat the budget officers start going to meet with section \nchiefs throughout the Federal Government. They are not going to \nbe working on the budget that will take place or go into effect \nat the time of the World Series. They are going to be working \non the budget that will go into effect a year from then. All \nright. Much of that money will actually not be spent until the \nend of the fiscal year, because that is the way it works. Most \nobligations of contracts or grants tend to take place in the \nlast 3 months of the year. So we are talking about July, August \nand September of 2014. Nobody in this room knows what the \nunemployment rate is going to be, which programs are going to \nshow up with serious management flaws in that time frame. And \nthat is the time frame we are working on now. And we are \ntalking about extending that another 12 months.\n    I don't think that is good management. I don't think that \nthe board of directors of this organization, which is the \nCongress, should give the executive branch that much latitude.\n    Now, I would say the record of the States is much less \nmixed than I have heard described in this room. At the end of \nWorld War II, there were only four States that had annual \nbudgets. In 2000, when the hearing on this legislation was \nheld, I helped work on testimony, and it had risen to 29 \nStates. It is now 31 States that have moved from biennial to \nannual budgeting. So they recognize that they can't see that \nfar in the future, that they are giving some agencies too much \nmoney and other agencies not enough money to provide vital \nservices.\n    Now, the other thing I would say about that is look at what \nhas happened to the Congress in the last 10 years. The last \ntime, 12 years ago, when this hearing was held, Congress was \ndoing a pretty good job holding to an annual budget. In the 10 \nyears that preceded that hearing, we had $100 billion in \nsupplemental appropriations over that period. Now, that is \nprobably too much. Half of that was the Gulf War, which was \nmoney that was paid back into the Treasury. But even if you \ncount the money that was paid back, we only had about $100 \nbillion, which was about 2 percent of all discretionary \nspending.\n    What happened in the decade since then when we were looking \nat biennial budgeting? We went to biannual budgeting. In fact, \nyou might even say we went to bimonthly budgeting. This \ncommittee reported 29 resolutions waiving points of order under \nthe Budget Act for supplemental appropriations that amounted to \n$1 trillion in the last 10 years, about $100 billion a year, 10 \npercent of discretionary spending every year.\n    I don't know why anybody would be worried about when the \nbudget resolution is passed, given the lack of deference that \nis given to that resolution in this body. We have just simply \nwalked right past the budget resolution. We have no plan. We \nsimply appropriate what we think we need, and then if we need \nmore we appropriate more. That is the way we have operated. \nPart of that I think was just an abuse of process. We should \nhave gotten away from that. But part of it is that an awful lot \nof these things can't be seen that far in the future.\n    I worked for a long time when I was here on trying to \nimprove the computer system at the FBI. On 9/11 they couldn't \nsend digital photographs to their field offices. Now, we put \nmillions and millions of dollars into that system, and it took \nyears to get off. And it is still struggling. Those kinds of \nprograms need to be looked at all the time. And they need to be \nfunded on a year-to-year basis, and they need to be cut when \nthey are not ready.\n    Mr. Young talked about the need to give multiyear funding \nto the Defense Department. The best thing that the \nAppropriations Committee did the entire time I served on it was \nwhen Jerry Lewis cut the F-22 significantly. Now, it wasn't \nthat we lost planes, it was we sent a warning shot to the Air \nForce: Straighten this program out or you are going to lose it. \nAnd we have a much better plane today because the Congress did \nthat.\n    Now, the third thing I want to talk about is the balance of \npowers and the role of the Congress. I think that is a much \nbigger issue today than it was 12 years ago. I think the \nCongress is really failing to play its role under the \nConstitution. And I think the deep concern that the Founding \nFathers had that the executive branch could get away from the \nAmerican people, and the reason they created a Congress and \ngave them this power, was very well justified and justified by \nwhat the executive has done over the last decade.\n    And if there is one thing that I would like to leave with \nthe committee it is the fact that the power of the purse is \nrelatively meaningless unless the Congress knows exactly what \nthe money that they are appropriating is being spent for. And \ntoday I do not think that is true. I am amazed at how much the \nview that the executive branch is a benevolent partner in this \nrelationship. That has been my experience, and we have had nine \nPresidents since I was first an intern on Capitol Hill, and \nnone of them was anxious to share information with the \nCongress. It was hard-fought all the time, (every time,) and it \nwas particularly hard-fought on programs that were in trouble, \nprograms where there was a disagreement between the Congress \nand the executive branch. And I think it has gotten worse, not \nbetter.\n    I think the last administration was outrageous in their \nwillingness to just absolutely deny information that the \nCongress deserved. And I wish that I could say there had been \nmore improvement under this administration.\n    I am doing a project with somebody outside for the Center \nfor American Progress on the information available to budget \nmakers both in the executive branch and the legislative branch. \nAnd one person, a senior staffer on the House Appropriations \nCommittee, told us in the interview we did, ``I am struck with \nhow little useful information the committee now gets in making \nfunding decisions. We are getting more and more pages, there \nhas certainly been no decrease in the number of pages, but the \namount of useful information is really very little.'' And in \nreferring to one agency said, ``It is essentially a $10 billion \nblack box.''\n    Now, if we have that problem with year-to-year annual \nappropriations, I think that problem is going to get a lot \nworse. Think about the schedule that you are going to have. A \nMember gets elected in November. He comes here in January to be \nsworn in. In February he gets the President's budget. In March \nand April he has got an opportunity to comment to the \nAppropriations Committee. In June he votes on the budget and he \nis done. Why does anybody in the executive branch need to call \nhim after that?\n    A lot of these people, these agency heads that you are \ntalking about, they are going to be gone by the time you get \nreelected. And you know, my experience is they are not very \ncooperative at all, even when they know that you have a chance \nto go after them. The fact that we haven't been going after \nthem often enough means--is the reason that it has gotten \nworse, in my judgment.\n    So I think that there are many areas of reform that we need \nto look at. The system clearly is not working the way any of us \nwould want to, but I don't think the biennial budget is the \nroad to go down. Thank you.\n    The Chairman. Thank you very much."

"","","polis","Mr. Polis","    There are some of us on both sides of the biennial budgeting issue \nwho feel that this is exactly what Yogi Berra meant when he said, \n``Deja vu all over again.'' It seems that this committee has been \nhaving hearings on this issue since I was a young Hill staffer and \nAbraham Lincoln was president. Twelve years ago I worked on testimony \nfor my former boss, David Obey, for a hearing on a very similar bill \nintroduced by the gentleman from California who chaired this committee \nthen as he does today.\n    Obey argued that state governments were turning away from biennial \nbudgets because the long time horizon required in a biennial budget led \nto faulty decisions about funding levels leading to excessive \nappropriations in some instances and loss of needed services in others. \nHe pointed out that only four states used annual budgets at the end of \nWorld War II but that number had grown to 29 by 2000. Today it has \ngrown to 31.\nThe move to biannual budgeting\n    The biggest change that has taken place in the time frame for \nbudgeting has been at the federal level. In the decade prior to the \n2000 hearing, Congress had been fairly successful in sticking with \nannual budgets. During that entire decade less than $100 billion was \nprovided in spending outside the regular appropriation bills. More than \nhalf of that was funding for the First Gulf War, and that money was \nrepaid to the Treasury through contributions from other countries. But \neven counting the money that was repaid as supplemental spending, \naverage annual discretionary spending outside of regular appropriation \nmeasures was less than $10 billion per year, or about 2 percent of \ntotal discretionary.\n    Since the 2000 hearings on biennial budgeting, we have shifted \ndramatically away from annual budgets--but toward biannual or one might \neven argue bimonthly budgeting. In the decade following those hearings, \nthis committee reported 29 resolutions waiving budget act points of \norder on supplemental appropriations totaling more than $1 trillion. On \naverage, supplementals have accounted for about $100 billion a year in \nspending above the amount permitted by budget resolutions of that \nperiod or a little more than 10 percent of discretionary.\n    That has had a profound effect on our government. We in effect have \nnot had a budget process. We agree to not spend above a certain level \nuntil we decide to spend more.\nAnticipating resource needs too far into the future\n    The experience of the past decade also makes it clear that it is \ndifficult to anticipate needs even within the current annual time \nhorizon for budgeting.\n    In about three weeks pitchers and catchers will start reporting for \nspring training to get ready for the 2012 Major League Baseball season. \nAt about the same time, federal budget officers across the government \nwill start putting together the president's annual budget request--not \nfor the fiscal year that begins at the end of this baseball season but \na full year after that. Since much of the grant and contract money will \nbe obligated at the end of that fiscal year--which will be August and \nSeptember of 2014--there will be a 33-month time lag between the \nbeginning of the current budget process and the much of the spending \nthat it will facilitate. Biennial budgeting will add 12 months to that \ntimeframe and simply speaking, nobody's crystal ball is that good.\n    Nobody in this room really knows what employment in this country \nwill be like in the summer of 2015 or what types of security threats we \nwill face, or how much the management of troubled programs will be \nimproved or diminished, or how much revenue the Treasury is likely to \ncollect.\n    It denies the Congress, and indeed the American people, the \nopportunity to move resources to emerging priorities, and, equally \nimportant, it denies the opportunity to cut funding in a timely way for \nprograms that are underperforming or are no longer relevant to the \nproblems we face as a nation.\nProtecting checks and balances\n    Another point that was made in the 2000 Obey testimony was \nimportant then but it is much more important today: the impact that \nbiennial budgeting has on the ability of Congress to play its role as a \ncoequal branch of government.\n    The founding fathers would be incredulous at what now stands on the \nbanks of the Potomac, the seat of a government of more than 300 million \npeople--nearly 80 times the population represented by the delegates of \nthe Constitutional Convention. The real per-capita GDP of those 300 \nmillion is about 40 times that of the 4 million Americans who lived in \nthe colonies at the signing of the Constitution. The government of this \ncountry now both facilitates and regulates commercial activity that is \nmore than 3,000 times greater than it was in the beginning.\n    Those who gathered in Philadelphia had two central concerns. First, \nthat we create an executive vested with the power that would make it \ncapable of governing a country as large as the 13 colonies and, of \nequal importance, that such a government would not become so powerful \nthat the American people would lose control over it. That is why you \npeople (members of Congress) occupy this building. You were created to \nbe a check on the misuse and abuse of power by the executive. And to \nthe extent that was an issue in 1789, it is an issue that is about \n3,000 times bigger today.\n    The founding fathers gave Congress certain tools that they hoped \nwould counterbalance the authorities granted to the executive or, if \nyou will, would make Congress an even match for the president. The most \nfundamental of those tools was the power of the purse.\n    What we are discussing today is a very fundamental change in the \nway Congress is able to use that power. It deserves thorough and \nserious deliberation.\n    If I could leave you with only one point to consider today, it \nwould be that the power of the purse is meaningless if Congress does \nnot understand how the money the executive branch is requesting is \nlikely to be spent, and getting that information is never easy. Today \nit is harder than ever. We have had nine presidents since I first \nworked as an intern in the House of Representatives, and not one of \nthem was anxious to share his plans or explain his programs. But based \non research I have been doing over the past two years, I am convinced \nthe quality of information Congress gets has deteriorated \nsignificantly. Some presidents have gone to extraordinary links to keep \nCongress in the dark, and I would single out the previous \nadministration in that regard. At the same time it is often more \ndifficult to get good information because the agencies themselves don't \nhave the facts necessary for good management or decisions about \nresource allocation.\n    Among the dozens of budget professionals in both the legislative \nand executive branch that my colleague and I spoke with on this matter \nin recent years, a House Appropriations staffer made the point \nsuccinctly:"

"","","polis","Mr. Polis","          I am struck by how little useful information the committee \n        now gets in making funding decisions. We are getting more and \n        more pages. There has certainly been no decrease in the number \n        of pages. But the amount of useful information is really very \n        little."
break,break,break,break,break
"","","polis","Mr. Polis","    Referring to one agency he had responsibility over he said, ``It is \nessentially a $10 billion black box.''\n    Among those we interviewed we found a clear consensus that the \nquality of information now being used in decisions about resource \nallocation has deteriorated, and in certain agencies even that is not \navailable to Congress.\n    But the founding fathers expected presidents to overreach. That is \nwhy they gave Congress the extraordinary powers that are guaranteed in \nthe Constitution. But only Congress can assert those powers. It is the \nfault of Congress that so much of the federal budget flows into \naccounts that are poorly understood and go to programs that lack clear \ngoals and clear records of performance. It is the fault of Congress \nthat far less relevant information is contained in the annual budget \njustifications submitted by executive agencies today than was true in \nthe past.\n    If Congress has allowed its authority to demand the truth to slip \naway under a system of annual budgeting, I ask you to speculate on what \nwould happen if agency heads walked away in October of odd-numbered \nyears with all the money they need for the next 24 months, as is \nproposed by the legislation before this committee? Let's think about \nthat schedule for a minute. A member is elected to represent his \ndistrict in November; sworn in as a member of the House in January; \ngets the president's budget requests in February; has a chance to \ntestify or make recommendations to the appropriations committee in \nMarch and April; and in June votes on all 12 appropriation bills. That \nis it. He or she is done for the Congress. Why would an agency head \nreturn a phone call? There will be 20 months before the next budget is \nsubmitted, and a member of Congress will have to get re-elected before \nthe White House or any agency will likely need anything a member of \nCongress--or a committee of Congress, for that matter--can offer.\n    While Congress may be free to hold hearings during that period, \nwhat is the stick going to be for agencies that don't cooperate? As \nformer Congressional Budget Office Director June O'Neill testified \nbefore this committee some years ago, ``Congressional oversight that is \ndivorced from the purse strings may be less effective than oversight \nconducted through annual appropriations hearings linked to agency \nfunding requests.'' I would go further. The most troublesome agencies \nin the federal government--those proceeding with policies and \napproaches that the Congress disagrees with--will be far less likely to \ncooperate once their biennial budget is in place with any hearing or \noversight activity.\n    Theoretically Congress could extract all of the commitments they \nneed from agencies before the June deadline for voting on appropriation \nmatters has past. But that time period passes in a flash. It takes the \nbetter part of a year to put a good oversight investigation in place \nand by that time the opportunity to insure cooperation and extract the \npenalty for noncooperation will have expired.\nNeed for reform\n    I do not criticize this proposal because I am an old-time \nappropriator who is happy with the way things are or the way things \nused to be. There is plenty wrong with the way the system works and \nserious changes that need to be made. Appropriators need to be critics \nof the programs they oversee and not cheerleaders for those programs. \nThe congressional schedule should accommodate the opportunity to have \nthorough hearings on each agency's budget request. The committee should \nhave sufficient staff to fully monitor the justifications of each \nagency under its jurisdiction, and staff resources should not be \nsquandered on earmark management. Oversight committees should discover \nthe world of oversight--they might like it. The Senate must take steps \nnecessary to ensure that expired authorizations can be brought to the \nSenate floor. CBO has just reported that of the $640 billion in \nnondefense discretionary spending in the 2012 appropriations just \nenacted, $241 billion, or 40 percent, is not authorized. My belief is \nthat committees no longer charged with enacting legislation for \nprograms within their jurisdiction are also no longer engaged in any \nreal oversight.\n    There is a lot of work to do but unfortunately, biennial budgeting \nwill add to our problems, not reduce them.\nBiennial budgeting will exacerbate, not relieve, gridlock\n    I also want to address an argument that seems to be gaining more \ncurrency, an argument that I find somewhat remarkable: that two-year \nbudgets will help Congress perform its work in a more expeditious and \ntimely manner. Congress has two serious problems with respect to the \ntimeliness of its actions on budget and appropriation measures. First, \nclose to half the members of both houses of Congress favor dramatically \nsmaller government and about half do not. There are not many people in \nbetween and in the Senate a 60 percent majority is required to break \nthe deadlock. That issue will not get easier if Congress is voting on a \ntwo-year budget rather than a one-year budget--in fact it is likely to \nget harder and the timeframe allowed for its resolution is likely to \ngrow.\n    The second problem involves Senate Rules. Even when there is broad \nconsensus in the Senate, it is often impossible to move appropriation \nbills. A good example was the FY 2010 Energy and Water Appropriation on \nwhich a ``hold'' was exercised for much of the summer of 2009. After \nthe majority leader finally introduced a cloture motion, waiting the \nrequisite number of days and collecting the requisite number of votes, \nthe bill passed 85 to 9.\n    This kind of obstruction has always been possible in the Senate but \nfor most of our history it never happened. In 1994 the Senate passed a \nfew appropriation bills in June and most of the rest in July. By \nSeptember 30 we finished every conference report and delivered every \nbill as separate legislation to the president. But the old rules do not \nwork with the current Senate membership. It is no longer possible for \nthe Senate to consider all 12 appropriation bills--and in particular \nconsider them before the beginning of the new fiscal year. They are now \nimmaculately conceived in conference some months after the fiscal year \nhas begun and without ever having been debated by the full Senate. \nLengthen the fiscal year and you simply give the Senate more time to \ncogitate about when they will abandon their broken system. It would be \nfar better to address the real problem.\n    In 1974 the Senate agreed to an important exception to the rule of \nunlimited debate--an exception that we now refer to as reconciliation. \nIt is time for the Senate to adopt a second exception to ensure the \ndeliberate and timely consideration of all appropriation measures. All \ndebate on each measure could be limited to no more than 16 hours--\nexcept that each senator who chose to offer an amendment could do so \neven if the 16-hour time limit had been exceeded. Debate on a single \namendment could be limited to one hour.\n    If this kind of reform were enacted, then most senators would have \nmore say in appropriation matters than they do presently. The Senate \nwould be able to pass funding bills and get their bills to conference \ncommittee with the House in time to send final legislation to the \npresident before the beginning of the fiscal year. And a more orderly \nand structured approach to appropriations would free the Senate to \nspend more time on other important legislation.\nConclusion\n    We must be realistic about what we are capable of doing. We cannot \nsee far enough over the horizon to effectively allocate resources three \nyears in advance. We can and must restore a system of annual budgeting \nthat will pose much less risk to the country than experimenting with a \nsystem that will almost certainly weaken a branch of this government \nthat is too weak already."

"","","polis","Mr. Polis","    The Chairman. You know, you made an analogy to baseball. \nLots of championship playoffs are no longer with stalemate. \nThey have rules now to where there are no ties, so you can't \ntie the game. There are provisions for what you do when you get \ninto trouble or are unable to make a decision. And I think this \nwould be one of those where we would give the power back to the \npeople that need it. And if the process would work well, we \nwould understand what it is and do it every other year, once \nagain for the success. Thank you very much, both of you, for \nyour testimony.\n    Mr. Dreier."
"dreier","Mr. Dreier","polis","Mr. Polis","    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to \nboth of you for being here. And thanks, Ms. MacGuineas, for \nyour support of our effort here.\n    And I would like to just engage Mr. Lilly, if I might, for \na moment. First, I mean I disagree with a number of the \narguments you made. First of all, no one on this panel, \nDemocrat or Republican, has claimed that the States have been \nthe perfect example. I don't know how you came to the \nconclusion that something is coming from this panel. I went \nthrough the fact there has been an exchange, a give-and-take on \nthat. And some States have moved from annual to biennial, back \nto annual. Some have moved from biennial to annual, back to \nbiennial.\n    Mr. Lilly. My only point was that a lot more have moved \nfrom biennial to annual."
"dreier","Mr. Dreier","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    I understand that. I understand that. But the \nfact is, there has been this fluidity. And we did have an \nexample of--if you look at large States like Texas and Ohio, I \nmean there are a number of large States, and I know there is \nthis notion that it is only small States that have been \ninvolved in this, and that is not accurate.\n    The other thing that I would say is I think that you are \nwrong in claiming that half of the House and Senate would like \nto reduce the size of government and half wouldn't. I find many \nDemocrats join in the effort to try and bring about--Mr. Polis \nbeing an example--the size and scope and reach of government, \nand they want a greater degree of fiscal responsibility.\n    While I acknowledge we have gridlock here, I mean I think \nthat there are a number of things that have been done to \naddress that. Much more needs to be done. As I look at the \nstudies that have been done by the National Council of State \nLegislatures and then the study from the Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities, and I go to their conclusion, the National \nCouncil of State Legislatures actually points to the fact that \nthere may be enhanced oversight. And there is not a conclusion \non this. And similarly, the other group here, the Center, talks \nabout the idea of a pilot program.\n    What reaction do you have to what I threw out here of maybe \njust taking and building on what Mr. Young had talked about? \nBecause I mean, I think I have made it pretty clear I don't see \nthis as a panacea. I don't believe that all of the budget \nchallenges that we have, I don't believe that the problems that \nexist out there are all of a sudden going to be solved if we do \nmove to a biennial process. But I do think, again, back to what \nI started with, the Einstein quote, we have been doing this \nsince 1974. You have to acknowledge that the 1974 Budget \nImpoundment Act has not worked. And you know, you can point to \nthe Senate. Listen, Kent Conrad is one who again was a virulent \nopponent, I mean to this notion, and he believes that this \nwould go a long way towards doing it.\n    I understand the power of the hold and the changes to the \nrules in the Senate that need to be addressed. But I do think \nthat for us to explore this by taking some incremental steps, \nwhich is what I have thrown out on the table as an alternative \nto this, is something that would be worthy. What thoughts do \nyou have of our trying to look at that?\n    Mr. Lilly. Well, first of all, I think that the multiyear \nfunding is actually more prevalent than even Mr. Young--I mean, \nI can't think of any time that we have funded an aircraft \ncarrier that we didn't put the whole amount down. And that \nmoney is spent out over 5 years. If you go to the Public \nBuildings Office at the General Services Administration, one of \nthe problems we have right now is this Congress cut back the \nleasing funds, and they have multiyear leases, so they are \ngoing to have to pay cancellations simply because of the \nchanges. I don't think that is a good thing. I think that the \nAppropriations Committee ought to recognize that they are going \nto face those problems when they do that. It is not going to \nlessen when you have a multiyear or a single year.\n    But an awful lot of procurement is multiyear, an awful lot \nof the contracting the government does is multiyear. It is \npretty sensible most of the time, although I think you can find \nareas where it is not. One area that I think that this \naddresses that could be very important, is when we extend, when \nwe fail to pass appropriations bills on time and we let it go \ninto January, February, as we did then, when the money is \nfinally apportioned by OMB, agencies have about 6 months to \nobligate that money. That is not enough time to go through the \nregular contracting process. It results in short-circuiting \nthat. So no-bid contracts become more prevalent. It doesn't \nallow as good a review of grant applications as you should \nhave. And so I think we should try to address that.\n    My feeling is that the best way to address that is to put \nmore pressure on the Congress to finish appropriations in time. \nThe problem with going multiyear on the things that we don't \nalready, is you tend to start getting into controversial issues \nwhen you do that."
"dreier","Mr. Dreier","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    Would there be particular areas that you think \nwe might be able to explore it that are better than others?\n    Mr. Lilly. Let me give you an example of an information \nproblem we have and a problem with implementation. You take the \nBureau of Prisons. Now, that ought to be something, we kind of \nknow how many cases are in court, we know that the prison \npopulation is likely to grow. We have repeatedly appropriated \nless money than we needed there. Now, the reason is the Justice \nDepartment doesn't allow that information to be transmitted \nbecause they don't want to allocate that much money to the \nprisons. They want to keep it for initiatives that the Attorney \nGeneral has. So we end up with undercutting.\n    This has been verified both in GAO studies and the \nappropriations staff studies, that in fact Bureau of Prisons \nknew exactly what they wanted. Sure, we ought to just put them \non pretty much automatic pilot and say this is something that \nwe could go through down the years. But there is an awful lot \nof manipulation of the numbers there. And I think that \nmanipulation is likely to continue, whether you have biennial \nbudgets or annual budgets. We fail to anticipate their needs in \nan annual budget."
"dreier","Mr. Dreier","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    I just wondered if you might think about for \nus, as we look at possibly taking an incremental approach to \nthis, if you might think about areas where we could address \nsome of your valid concerns. I share your concern about \neconomic prognostication and the economic conditions for the \nfuture.\n    I mean, I do think that though some people say we will have \nmore continuing resolutions if we proceed with the biennial \nprocess, but you know what, we have continuing resolutions now. \nIf conditions, economic conditions do change and we need to \nhave the ability to address it, the fact that we have done this \nin a biennial way does not undermine the ability to address \nthose changing economic conditions in the future. So I think \nthat, you know, I mean it makes it challenging, I will \nacknowledge, but I think that there are also tremendous \nbenefits.\n    Anyway, I would love to have, you know, any thoughts or \nrecommendations that you might have, if you could take some \ntime, and even, you know, with your think tank if you could \nexplore steps because, again, it has been the opponents who \nhave talked about the idea of maybe exploring this with an \nincremental approach, and if you could do that, I would very \nmuch appreciate it.\n    Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for allowing me to ask \nthese distinguished panelists questions, and thanks again for \nholding this hearing. I think it has been very helpful, and \nagain I agree with your argument that we hope very much that we \ndon't have to, you know, a dozen years from now be dealing with \nthe same thing, and be able to take some kind of action on \nthis. Thanks to Mr. Polis, too, for his very thoughtful \nexploration of this issue.\n    The Chairman. Chairman Dreier, thank you for not only your \nleadership in this idea for the years that you have been in \nCongress, but also the time to apply the proper way to get it \ndone now so that we can gain the--so the American people can \nhave confidence in that which we do. Mr. Polis."
"polis","Mr. Polis","dreier","Mr. Dreier","    I want to thank our panelists for being here.\n    Just one quick question. We all have our kind of pet causes \nwith regard to the budget, and one that I have long been \ninterested in is why we have no capital budget at the Federal \nlevel, and that is a separate issue.\n    Other than that, I am wondering if moving to biennial \nbudgeting would, in fact, be a first step towards a capital \nbudget insofar as it would allow capital projects to be \nexpensed over 2 years under this proposal, rather than all in \nthe year that they are made. If either of you know the answer. \nIf not, we can find it elsewhere.\n    Ms. MacGuineas. I guess I will respond more broadly to the \ncapital budget, which has always been something that we have \nbeen drawn to, because obviously, I mean, one of the biggest \nchallenges we have is how do we repurpose our budget so that we \nfocus more on investment and away from consumption? And part of \nthe budget process, if it were to reward those changes, it \nwould make it much easier to do that, because right now you \ndon't get credit for investing in things that have returns over \ntime and promote growth. I think the risk has always been, of \ncourse, the political risk, which is that you start counting \neverything as investments, which just happens to be your \nfavorite program. And we have seen this in so many ways, that \nsomething that is pro-growth in times when the economy is good \nsuddenly becomes stimulus in times when the economy is bad. So \nI think that is the trade-off.\n    I am not sure that the expensing would be altered in terms \nof biennial budgeting because that would have to do with the \ntax laws. But do you know? I think that is a tax law issue more \nthan it is the budgeting window.\n    Mr. Lilly. Yeah, I agree. I mean, I certainly think there \nhas been a very destructive bias against investment in the \nFederal budget, and as entitlements grow and so forth, the \nappropriations process is squeezed down. That is one reason I \nthink you hear so many complaints about the uncertainty of \nFederal budgeting, is that the small part of the budget which \nis discretionary spending, particularly domestic discretionary \nspending, absorbs all of the desires for cuts, and that really \ncuts into investments.\n    The question with the capital budgeting is, which \ninvestments are you going to call investment? I mean, is \nhighway construction more of an investment than NIH research? \nAnd, you know, I would like to see something that is fairly \nbroad and deals with intellectual capital as well as physical \ncapital. But I also think Maya is right, that it is very hard \nto define."
"polis","Mr. Polis","polis","Mr. Polis","    I would submit that there are ways that this is \ndone in the private sector, and no matter where we draw the \nlines and how we do it, it is likely to lead to a better \naccounting of investment than how we do it now, which \neffectively denies the possibility of investment and treats \ninvestments and capital expenses as expenses, and obviously \nthere is a debate about, as you said, where to draw the line. \nBut, again, most methods of accounting that the private sector \nuses in this regard would--are better than the current version \ncurrently used by the Federal Government.\n    I will yield back to the gentleman, yield back the balance \nof my time.\n    The Chairman. Thank you very much. I want to thank not only \nthe gentleman, Mr. Polis, for stepping in very ably today to \nrepresent Mr. Hastings, him bringing to the table his thoughts \nand ideas, his time that he has given us today to make sure \nthat this hearing before the Rules Committee is done in a way \nthat would bring stature to the idea, the opportunity for us to \npush it forward.\n    Obviously our panel today brought not only the expertise, \nbut I think, brought some ideas about what we need to do to go \nmature the idea, what the intended impact would be. Don't \nanswer the question, but the question came up in my mind: Does \nthe Federal Government even follow tax law? If we had to live \nby--if the government had to live by the laws that everybody \nelse did, I don't know the answer; whether the government \nfollows accounting standards and practices that would be \nexpected by those that they perhaps have within their--our \nowners. I brought up that question. So Maya, perhaps some day \nwhat I will do is I will ask you to come up here and we will \nexplore that idea also.\n    Ms. MacGuineas. Sure.\n    The Chairman. I want to thank this entire panel for being \nhere. Ms. MacGuineas, Mr. Lilly, your statements, we would like \nto take them, without objection, we will include those, not \njust your words, but whatever you brought, your statements.\n    Mr. Lilly. I would ask to revise and extend. I found some \ntypos that need to be stricken.\n    The Chairman. I would allow the gentleman to do that. As \nhas been noted earlier, we are going to hold the record open \nfor 5 days, allowing other members to have that opportunity.\n    I would also like to, without objection, bring in a \nstatement from the Bipartisan Policy Center and also Citizens \nAgainst Government Waste, who have asked that their ideas be \npresented as part of the record today."
