"ayotte","Senator Ayotte","","","    I wanted to thank Madam Chairman for having \nthis hearing, appreciate it.\n    And I also wanted to welcome our District Director, Greta \nJohansson, here. You know one thing we share is that we are \nboth relatively new to our position. So appreciate what you are \ndoing in our State.\n    And Senator Shaheen and I actually were privileged to co-\nhost a recent event called a Matchmaker Event in the State of \nNew Hampshire that I think I got very good feedback from our \nsmall businesses on, to connect small businesses to Federal \ncontractors, to build those relationships, and I think that was \nvery helpful.\n    You know, one of the things that I cannot help but thinking \nwhen I heard what you had to say, Mr. Goldberg, in this \ndiscussion about the HUBZones, one of the things that I would \nlike to hear your insight on is do we need to give you also \ngreater authority and greater tools in terms of if someone is \ncaught in a situation like you have identified, Mr. Goldberg, \nthat you would have the opportunity to put them on a list where \nyou are off--no more contracting, no more receipt of the funds.\n    I think I get concerned often that even the bureaucracy you \nhave to follow in trying to eliminate those who commit \nfraudulent behavior may be overly burdensome. And can we help \nyou by giving you some tools here or more authority on your end \nto deal with this fraud and to cut people off sooner and in a \nmore expedited fashion? I would love your insight on that."

"","","","","    [Laughter.]\n    Chair Landrieu. That is a great question. It has prompted a \nlot of room to talk."
"ayotte","Senator Ayotte","ayotte","Senator Ayotte","    Because you know that is something that we \ncould address in this Committee and make sure you have those \ntools and you have the authority to do what needs to be done \ntoo.\n    Chair Landrieu. All right. Let's respond to that.\n    Go ahead, Mr. Dickson.\n    Mr. Dickson. You are sort of darned if you do and darned if \nyou do not. All right?\n    Part of our job is to help recruit those businesses to do \nbusiness with the Federal Government and train them and also \nregulate them.\n    I like the idea, personally, about having that authority to \nbe able to say if you are running a fraudulent business on a \nHUBZone or a women-owned business or a service-disabled \nveteran-owned business, or even a small business that is \nsupposedly small and you find out it is not by the NAICS codes, \nthat we could do something a lot more expeditiously than we do. \nAll right.\n    That is in fact one of the problems. It just takes too long \nto act on it, and the bureaucracy in order to act on it takes a \nlong time. And then by the time you get to the end of the road, \na lot of these companies, nothing happens to them anyway. So \nthere is not a--as Gil said, there is not a fear of God in them \nbecause they are going to get----\n    Chair Landrieu. Well, we need to hone down on that and why, \nwhen you say the bureaucracy is not working fast enough. It \ngets back maybe to that the prosecutors themselves do not have \nthe staff necessary to prosecute. That may be one thing. Or, it \ncould be something else. I do not know.\n    And Ms. Johansson, if you would comment, I am going to slip \nout and have my Brian Van Hook step up, but we are in very able \nhands to finish this roundtable in the next 35 or 40 minutes.\n    It has been excellent. Your comments have been terrific, \nyour suggestions. We really appreciate getting a better feel \nfor what our district offices are actually up against, what \nyour challenges are and what you need as we prepare for these \nbudget discussions, but as we prepare to run the best agency \nand provide the oversight we can to the SBA, the best we can.\n    So Greta, and then I am going to slip out. Thank you all so \nmuch.\n    Ms. Johansson. Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on the \nis there something that we could do. And I agree; it is sort of \nyes and no. There is an upside and a downside.\n    On the one hand, the last thing we want to do is stall \nsomeone who--if we are mistaken. I mean, how much investigation \ncan you do to know is this a legitimate HUBZone firm? That is a \nchallenge, and that is a challenge with our staffing levels and \nwith the kinds of information you need to have access to.\n    But there, it would be very beneficial, I think, if we had \nsome sort of fast way of throwing up a red flag that could \nlaunch enough of an investigation to figure out what is it we \nwould need to confirm, yea or nay, without disheartening anyone \nwho belongs in the program, without risking a contract that \nshould be awarded, if there was some sort of a fast way that we \nhad the ability to send up an alert. And that is something that \nwe ought to be able to do internally, subject to resources. You \nwould think that we would be able to find a way to have \nknowledgeable enough staff in both the districts and in \nheadquarters to be able to identify a way to make that quicker.\n    Before we implemented that, I would want to feel \ncomfortable that we are not going to either overburden \nourselves or discourage legitimate firms, yet still catch, some \nsort of an early warning way to catch, those ones who are \ncorrupt because it does not really take all that much. It only \ntakes one or two bad contracts to firms that should not have \ngotten them to seriously damage the viability of what is \notherwise a very good program.\n    And it discourages the contracting officers from even \ntrying to do HUBZone. I mean just it is bad all around, to have \ncontracts misappropriated.\n    I am not sure. A lot of it does seem to come down to \nresources. How would we go about doing that in a way that was \nboth effective without being destructive or burdensome?\n    Ms. Nelson. I just had a thought just before she started \ntalking. We have a similar model in that our lender oversight \nfolks send out reviewers, auditors to do reviews periodically, \nand if they find problems within a loan that might jeopardize \nthe guaranty at purchase time, should it be, it is flagged \nwithin our system.\n    I do not know exactly how you relate that to the HUBZone, \nbut if there is a flag, a contractor who is looking for a \nHUBZone, at least we would have some leverage to get their \nattention to come in and prove to us that they are who they \nsaid they were and a legitimate business. We call it a Guaranty \nRepair Flag.\n    Mr. Van Hook. And Pravina.\n    Ms. Raghavan. I was just going to add that I do think it \nwould be great to have a list. And I agree with both \ncolleagues; it is a good thing and a bad thing.\n    And one of the good reasons is in the State of New York as \nwell as the City of New York, the MTA, we have some major \nagencies that do business with us and do business with our \nHUBZones. They actually look at our list to figure out whether \nthey are real bona fide firms. And to be able to put someone on \na list, so that they are not only defrauding the Federal \nGovernment but also the State and the city, would be a \nfantastic thing.\n    And one of the things we have been trying, back to the \noriginal question, is how do we get to make sure we prevent \nfraud. Actually, we have been holding our training sessions in \nHUBZones. So the firms actually have to be physically present \nin their HUBZone when they get trained. So their orientation \nmeeting actually happens in their place of business at the \nHUBZone, but granted, it has to have staff to do that.\n    And we actually sometimes do it with the city and State. We \nbring them in with us because then you can learn about our \nprograms as well as the other two. When you look at the State \nof New York, there is quite a lot, but the city alone has quite \na few programs. So it would be nice to have a great list to sit \nthere and go: You are not going to defraud us on three \ndifferent levels.\n    Mr. Van Hook. Yes, Gil, if you wanted to make a comment, \nand then I would turn it back over to the Senator.\n    Mr. Goldberg. Okay. I think the Senator hit the nail on the \nhead. I think we do need more responsibility and more tools at \nour disposal. Again, as I said, being the old guy in the room, \nnot only do I remember when the HUBZone legislation was rolled \nout and we rolled out the program and I had a big enough staff \nto have HUBZone police, I have seen that happen in other areas \nof the agency as well. But we have to have the staff to go \nalong with the authority and the responsibility because if we \ndo not have the staff then we end up in a situation where it is \non the books that we are doing it, but in reality we are doing \nit by putting a Band-Aid over it. And we really need that staff \nto make it work.\n    Mr. Van Hook. And Senator, did you have a follow-up?"
"ayotte","Senator Ayotte","ayotte","Senator Ayotte","    I do not know if anyone had any additional \ncomments on this issue. I did not want to cut anyone off. It is \nimportant.\n    Mr. Van Hook. Okay, gotcha.\n    Greg.\n    Mr. Lopez. You know, I think it is important for us to \nremember that when the contracts are awarded to the HUBZone \ncompanies they are awarded by the procuring agency, and so SBA \ndoes not have the authority to determine who gets a contract \nand who does not get a contract. And I think that is why it is \nvery important when the SBA is working very closely with the \nprocurement Federal agencies to understand the HUBZone program, \nand it is contract oversight that really falls within the realm \nof the contracting officer. We are an extension of that process \nby ensuring that they are meeting the eligibility, but we \nreally need to work in partnership.\n    And I think that message has yet to really resonate within \nthe procurement arms of some of the other agencies, but they \nare starting to hear. For the last 18 months, 2 years, we have \nbeen going out. So they are starting to pay a little bit more \nattention as to the importance of the HUBZone and how we are \nlooking at them.\n    So I think we are making a lot of progress, but I really \nthink that at the end of the day the stronger we build those \nrelationships with the contracting officers that actually do \nthe oversight of the contract, we will be able to really \nminimize a lot of the fraud, waste and abuse, if we all work \ntogether.\n    Mr. Van Hook. Mr. Umberger.\n    Mr. Umberger. Just a quick comment, that whether it is a \nHUBZone determination based on a site visit that it is a \nfraudulent firm, or what have you, or an 8(a) firm that comes \nup under an annual review that it is determined that at least \nin the district's eyes this is a fraudulent firm, rather than \nwhat we do now is we put them into a termination process, and \nthe termination process is out of our hands. It is at a higher \nauthority, and it takes time.\n    I could never, for the life of me, understand if we had \nmade a recommendation for a termination, why is that firm not \nsuspended from further contracting opportunities. So that would \nbe something; I think a tool that we could really use to sink \nsome teeth into this.\n    Mr. Van Hook. And Mr. Dickson.\n    Mr. Dickson. Just sort of a final comment on procurement, \nyou know, Greg and I think a lot alike. It is really scary, \nGreg.\n    In another life I was a procurement officer in the \ngovernment for the Army, and it astounds me the lack of \nunderstanding that the procurement officers have these days of \nthe small business set-aside programs, to include not only the \nsmall business at 23 percent but also the 55 and the 33--okay, \n5 percent SDB, 5 percent women, 3 percent HUBZone, 3 percent \nservice-disabled veteran.\n    If you look at the Defense Acquisition University, you \nmight be very chagrined and surprised to find, since there is \n23 percent of all the prime contracts are supposed to go to \nsmall businesses in the country, how little the training goes \nto the contracts officers and their staffs.\n    I know, like many of my colleagues around the table here, I \nmean, we do a lot of training in the procurement agencies in \nour districts as to what these programs are and how to use them \nbecause they honestly do not know. I sat in the Union League \nseveral years ago, in Philadelphia, and there was a HCA, Head \nof a Contract Agency. He was wearing two stars on his \nshoulders, and he was talking about his small business goals. \nAnd he said we are doing fine, and he specifically was talking \nabout HUBZone. And it really surprised me because his goal was \n3 percent and they are at 1.3 percent. Because they had done \nbetter than the previous year, which they were at 1.2 percent \nthe year before, he thought they were doing fine.\n    And I felt like standing up and saying, General, you do not \nget it. I mean your goal is 3 percent. You are not doing fine \nuntil you have surpassed your goal.\n    And it was just the mentality: Well, we did better than \nlast year, rather than meeting the goal.\n    These goals, these set-aside programs are good for the \nUnited States. It is good for industry. It is good for the \ngovernment.\n    Until these contract officers not only understand these \nprograms, but also as they are looking at their procurement \nrequirements in the one hand, they need to be looking at their \nactual goal attainment in the other hand and have the authority \nto be able to say, well, I am going to take this one; I am \ngoing to make it a HUBZone. Or, I am going to take this one; I \nam going to make it a women-owned business or just a small \nbusiness.\n    They need to be able to look at that stuff on a daily and \nweekly and monthly basis. And until they do that, we are not \ngoing to get their attention.\n    Mr. Van Hook. And Greta, did you have a comment?\n    Ms. Johansson. Just a quick follow-up, and it is really \nonly specific to HUBZones is most of what I have heard here \ntoday, and my own experience, is the HUBZone firms that were \nnot really HUBZone firms was based primarily on they did not \nreally have a real place of business in a HUBZone. And for much \nof the country that may be hard to assess before a firm is \napproved into the HUBZone program, but there are areas where \ndrive-bys are really not difficult. Maybe I am biased because I \ncome from New England and we can actually drive by just about \nanywhere we need to, and that is not true everywhere.\n    But some of those things, rather than catching the fraud \nafter someone is in a program or receiving contracts, we may be \nable to prevent it up front if the primary problem, is in the \nHUBZone program anyway. The most frequent problem seems to be \nplace of business. That can be checked. And if we cannot do it \nourselves, there are resources all over the country, and we all \nhave partners that we work with.\n    And I am just curious if there is some way that we can do a \nmore effective job before they get in the program. And it is \nalso less public that way, so it is not discouraging for either \nthe contracting officers or legitimate HUBZone firms. I am just \ncurious if that might be an area where we could do better, \nsubject to resources."
"ayotte","Senator Ayotte","ayotte","Senator Ayotte","    I wanted to thank all of you for being here \nand for the important work that you do. I, of course, want to \ngive special thanks to our District Director in New Hampshire. \nWe can get around New Hampshire probably a little bit easier \nthan some of the other States you represent, but very much \nappreciate the work you are doing for small businesses in the \ncountry.\n    My husband is a small business owner. So you know it is \nalways a challenge to start your own business and to grow it, \nenhance it, and we just want to create a positive climate for \nall of them to do that, particularly in these difficult \neconomic times.\n    So I have to run, but I want to thank you all for being \nhere today.\n    Mr. Van Hook. Thank you.\n    And I guess kind of following up on the discussion that you \nguys had, I know that a lot of district offices have road shows \nand kind of get out. But also when we mention the staffing cuts \nthat you guys have had, could you just kind of briefly talk \nabout what, how much time is spent in the office versus how \nmuch time is spent on the road because I know that as the staff \nhas been cut that has kind of limited also the ability to get \nout and travel around?\n    So I guess you are closer to me. I will go with you first.\n    Mr. Cadena. Well, when I got to the office there were four \nof us in the office and two up in Reno, and we have one of the \nlargest areas to cover. So we are now up to a total of eight \npeople.\n    Also, in Nevada, we are kind of like the national office \nbased on one thing. We have so many conferences that come into \nNevada, and we send people there all the time.\n    So there is a lot of times in my office where it is \nliterally I am there. And if I am not, somebody else is, and \nthat is one person. So we do cover.\n    So the reality is it is probably a little over 70 percent \nof the time we have got people out constantly. Up in Reno, \nbecause it is such a large area, I have one guy basically that \nlives on the road, literally lives on the road. He has his \nDurango that we finally got him, and he just drives around and \ngoes from small town to small town. But that is an issue, but \nin our office, more so than anything else is.\n    And it is great because it helps our training because we do \nget some wonderful--the one I am looking forward to is there is \nthe WBENC, the women's businesses. It is going to be 4,000 \nsmall businesses, a women's group that comes in. We are also \ngoing to have the DAC that should have well over a couple \nthousand.\n    But it does take a lot of our people's time. So it kind \nof--yes, we appreciate it because we like doing it and it is \nhigh profile. We get to learn a lot. However, most of that time \nhas nothing to do with my district because most of the people \nthat we are talking to are from out of state.\n    So it does have--we love it because we learn a lot, but we \nare not really supporting, if you will, our district because we \nare doing so much.\n    And it makes sense. It does not make any sense to be \nsending people from all over the country when you have got an \noffice there. The great thing is just give me a little more \nstaff.\n    Mr. Van Hook. Well, we keep track of that in New Orleans \nbecause we are also competing with you guys for conventions. So \nI think it is New Orleans or Vegas is kind of where folks split \ntheir time.\n    Mr. Cadena. And we both have had different kinds of \ndisasters.\n    Mr. Van Hook. Yes, that is true.\n    Lynn.\n    Ms. Douthett. One of the things, we are fortunate in that \nwe actually have three alternative work sites, which means that \nI have three guys on the ground that cover a territory. One is \nlarge; it is 34 counties. And one is small; it is 16 counties.\n    But our office is set up in a model that works with those \nfolks out in the field, utilizing their time. Probably at least \n70 percent of it is on the road because the charge was that we \nwould actually see our loan production increase, our strategic \nalliances create more workshops and training for both small \nbusinesses and citizens, which we have effectively done over \nthe last seven years, using this model.\n    Where we have a challenge is in the district office because \nour procurement portfolio is we have 120 firms and we have 2 \npeople to manage the program, and that compliance issue is \nhuge. So even though we can send them out to do some speaking, \nthey have to remain really to do the annual reviews, which is a \nvery time-consuming process.\n    And as far as myself and our lender relations folks and our \nmarketing people, they are on the road I would say at least 50 \npercent of the time.\n    Mr. Van Hook. And when you say certain staff travel more \nthan other staff, so there is a certain complex relation.\n    Ms. Douthett. I would say that the model was that we would \ntransform ourselves into a marketing organization, and do more \nsales and marketing and training, which we have effectively \ndone. But it is a challenge in terms of the reporting functions \nand compliance to be sure that we have every I dotted and every \nT crossed.\n    Mr. Van Hook. Mr. Dickson.\n    Mr. Dickson. The SBA actually categorizes the district \noffices as very small, small, medium, large and extra large. \nOkay?\n    Pravina, for instance, is an extra large, New York City, of \ncourse. Philadelphia, last time I checked was the largest of \nthe large. All right?\n    Five years ago, we had 11 people, and we got down to 5. Now \nI am at 17, which has been a wonderful thing.\n    We have broken up our staff into teams, geographical teams, \nand we have taken away silos where I have the lending people, \nthe government contracting people and the marketing people all \nunderneath a lead for a specific geographic area. And it works \nvery well for us. All right?\n    All the people, I have hired. Everybody has come from \noutside the government except for my deputy who just got back \nfrom Saddam Hussein's palace. He was the DLA Commander in \nBaghdad for six months. Everybody else came from outside the \ngovernment, and very entrepreneurial, all the way from people \nfrom their early 30s to in their 60s, older than I am. All \nright?\n    Their jobs are not in the office. I make them come to the \noffice one time every two weeks for a staff call just so I can \nsee their face and make sure that they know what is going on, \net cetera. But they spend tons of time out of the office, \ndealing with banks and businesses and economic development \nagencies, and you name it. They are out there networking, \ncounseling businesses, recruiting banks, et cetera. We have \nthree government cars, and we run the wheels off of those \nbabies because I mean it is a big district.\n    I have got two-thirds of the State of Pennsylvania, and our \njob is to go out there and penetrate the market with the gospel \nof the SBA, as to the technical assistance that is out there, \nthat is available, the counseling for government contracting, \nhow do you do that, how do you get capital access, whether it \nis SBA guaranteed loans or commercial loans or USDA loans. You \nknow, how do you get the money that you need to run your \ncompany and to hopefully expand your company? All right?\n    So our people's jobs are on the road, and they do it. Our \nstaff, and I know a lot of my colleagues' staffs, they do an \nabsolutely excellent job. I am very proud of them.\n    Mr. Van Hook. Okay. Thanks.\n    I am going to turn it over to Linda, and then I know we \nhave maybe 15 minutes or so. So I am going to turn it over to \nDiane because she might have some questions. And I have a \ncouple more questions for you guys since the Senator covered \nsome of my good questions, but I still have a couple more for \nyou.\n    So, Linda.\n    Ms. Nelson. Okay. One of the things we have done is try \nto--we are a staff of 11. We are a small office, and we are \npretty much at the max by the previous definition. We have had \nto retrain folks.\n    For instance, if one of my lender relations is going to \nBatesville, Arkansas to do a lender training and there is a \nHUBZone there, she goes by, looks to see if it looks like a \nbona fide business, may check with the post office. We check \nwater records to see if they have water running to the \nbuilding. You know most of them need a restroom. We think, \nanyway, but not in Arkansas maybe.\n    So we kind of share duties instead of just one person is \nresponsible for doing all of this, and I am sure others have \ndone this too.\n    But we have learned to leverage our State agencies, and we \nhave an MOU. This is a national pilot, and we are 1 of the 17 \nStates with the USDA Rural Development. They have more money \nthan we do and sometimes more people because they have field \nagents around their State. And so, we put literature there, and \nsometimes they serve as a referral.\n    But the Arkansas Economic Development Commission has \nrecently reorganized their economic developers into industry-\nspecific. So we are going to be training them, and they are in \nall these different areas of the State more than we can \npossibly be. I mean we are out. We have three cars. We are out \na lot--to alert us when there is something specific.\n    You know, we sometimes go hold a bank's hand. They do not \nwant to do the designated driver approach, and so we go hold \ntheir hands from the application. I have even typed up their \nclosing documents, I am ashamed to say, because it was painful \nto watch this loan officer doing it, and I did. We will do \nwhatever we can as far as leveraging that.\n    So I think the main thing is retraining, sharing and \nleveraging some of the outside resources, including our SBTDC. \nThey will do drive-bys for us in their area because they have \nsix sub-centers.\n    Mr. Van Hook. Thanks.\n    And Diane, did you have a question?\n    Ms. Dietz. Absolutely. I have about 50 questions for you \nall, but I know some of you have planes to catch, so we \ncertainly will not keep you here that long.\n    I would like to echo the Chair's remarks and sincerely \nthank you for coming today. Washington, DC, is for some of you, \na train ride and for many of you, a plane ride away, and we \ncertainly appreciate your taking this afternoon to spend with \nus. We could keep you here all afternoon, asking questions and \nstill have more questions, but of course we will not.\n    On behalf of the Ranking Member, we do sincerely appreciate \nyour time, and I believe that today's panel is truly a jobs \ncreation panel. So we cannot tell you enough how much this \nfeedback is important to us.\n    I did want to hit on one question. It is something we hear \na lot about in the Committee. It is a primary concern for small \nbusiness owners, entrepreneurs, and that is the regulatory \nenvironment.\n    And I would love to hear from each of you. One of the \nfantastic aspects of this panel is that it is so broad. There \nare many of you from the Northeast. We love the Northeast, and \nwe love the South as well, and there are some wonderful people \nhere from the West.\n    I am wondering, maybe specific to your state or industries \nthat you see in your state, particularly maybe to \nmanufacturing, what you see as a hurdle for small business in \ncreating jobs. Is the regulatory environment something that you \nhear a lot about from small business owners?\n    The Office of Advocacy at SBA released a report that said \nsmall businesses with 20 employees or less pay approximately 36 \npercent more in regulatory costs, and we hear consistently that \nthe regulatory environment is a major hurdle to job creation.\n    So I am wondering if you could shed some light on what we \ncan do from the Committee perspective, and Mr. Dickson, I will \nstart with you.\n    Mr. Dickson. Eastern Pennsylvania used to be a \nmanufacturing heyday. It was really big there, and I think that \nis why then Administrator Hector Barreto sent me to \nPhiladelphia, because of my manufacturing background. The \ncomments I have for you are not from the SBA, are from just my \npersonal experience.\n    We go back to basics as to how do you grow a company, how \ndo you expand your sales. Again, there are only three places--\ndomestic, international and government. Okay? And the \ngovernment, of course, goes to Federal, State, local, metro \nairport authorities--you name it--all over the place.\n    Manufacturing, for the most part, or much manufacturing, \nhas gone offshore now. All right? In my background I have seen \nthat, and it is very disturbing to me personally because I am \nan industrial engineer by trade.\n    We have a different cost basis in the United States. It is \nvery difficult for manufacturers to compete on a level playing \nfield when there is not a level playing field with \ninternational customers and international manufacturers.\n    You know, in industry in the United States, when we have a \nbarrel of used oil, we recycle it; we take care of it. In other \ncountries they take it out back, and they throw it away. All \nright?\n    Our plants are filled with safety devices for protecting \nour workers. You know, hard hats and glasses and steel-toed \nshoes and hand guards on CNC mills and lathes and things like \nthat. That costs money, and those are really all good things.\n    Do not get me wrong. I think they are wonderful things, but \nour manufacturers are competing on a worldwide basis now, with \npeople that do not have that kind of cost basis. All right? And \nit puts them in a huge disadvantage.\n    And I talk to people all the time, realizing that 19 out of \nevery 20 customers are overseas when you look at the numbers. I \ntalk to manufacturers all the time and try to get them to look \ninto exporting their products, and they never think about it \nbecause they cannot compete with the prices overseas.\n    Just in the company that I came from, before I came to \nhere, I mean we were offloading all sorts of things to the \nPacific Rim, to South America, to Eastern Europe and things \nlike that.\n    I mean when you look at the wrap rate, which is the labor \nrate and the material and overhead and everything else. When \nyou look at the wrap rate overseas versus the wrap rate in the \nUnited States, it is not competitive.\n    Ms. Dietz. What do we do to level the playing field for \nmanufacturers? In 2008, if the manufacturing sector were a \ncountry, they would have been the 8th largest economy in the \nworld. So what do we do? We need those jobs.\n    Mr. Dickson. This sounds like protectionism, but it is \nreally not. Okay? One thing that the Federal Government could \ndo is put tariffs on those products coming from overseas \ncountries that do not have the same type of environmental or \nworker safety laws. There has got to be a mathematical method \nof looking at the different industries and all of the countries \nthat come to the United States to sell their products and if we \ncould figure out how to mathematically equalize the playing \nfield. Okay.\n    For instance, you get a country that is manufacturing \ntextiles. All right. And if we could figure out how much more \nour textile manufacturers are paying just for the environmental \nand just for the safety side of it, and then put a tariff on \nthose products, that would probably do two things. First of \nall, it would certainly equalize the playing field, but it \nwould also force other countries to increase their awareness of \nsafety and environmental. All right?\n    Ms. Dietz. Yes.\n    Mr. Dickson. To me, it would level this playing field that \nhas become very unlevel.\n    And as a manufacturer, in a manufacturing background, you \nwould not believe. It is 25, 30, 35 percent more expensive to \nmanufacture in the United States. I could get things \nmanufactured and shipped to the United States cheaper than I \ncould manufacture them in the United States. That is a real \ndisadvantage for a small business.\n    Ms. Dietz. Thank you very much.\n    Mr. Lopez, I know you have a plane to catch, and if you \nwould like to answer this and then leave, I certainly \nappreciate your time today.\n    Mr. Lopez. You bet. You know, going back, I want to go back \nto the last question about us going out and how much time we \nspend in the office and how much time we spend outside of the \noffice.\n    I can share with you--and I am sure we are experiencing it \nacross the country--there is more and more demand from the \ngeneral public and organizations for SBA to come out into the \ngeneral public to talk about our programs and services. There \nis a thirst amongst small businesses to learn what SBA can do \nto assist them.\n    And I can tell you in my office the staff does not \nappreciate when I go out and talk to the community because the \nphone starts ringing and I create more work because when people \nstart realizing all the resources and all the depth and all the \npartners that we have at their disposal, at no cost, then they \nstart realizing that what a great opportunity to learn more \nabout the Federal contracting, business development, economic \ndevelopment, all those types of things. So I can just say that \nas we go out there, there is more and more that people realize \nthis agency has to offer to the strength of our country.\n    Now when it comes to the regulatory issues, clearly, there \nis a lot of need for regulatory guidance. However, I can tell \nyou this; small businesses in my area are concerned as to the \nlanguage. It is not written necessarily for the common \nbusinessman. You know, you need to have attorneys. You need to \nhave staff interpretation as to what are these regulatory \nissues that they are supposed to follow. Even when they think \nthey have it right, perhaps there is an attorney that has a \ndifferent interpretation of what it is that the regulation \nshould be doing and how it should be applied.\n    So I would encourage that while we have the need for \nregulatory language, it needs to be simplified so that small \nbusinesses can understand it, so that they can better plan for \nthe future as to how they are going to expand and how they are \ngoing to continue to deliver the services, recognizing that \nthere are additional guidelines.\n    And the other thing I would say is sometimes these \nregulatory policies are so well hidden that the small business \nowners does not even know about it until someone brings it to \ntheir attention, not in an informative manner but more in a \npunitive manner, that they are not following it.\n    Ms. Dietz. Thank you very much.\n    Ms. Raghavan.\n    Ms. Raghavan. Congratulations. You said my name correctly.\n    Ms. Dietz. You know what? Brian gave me a phenomenal \nphonetic spelling. So I must give the credit to Brian.\n    Ms. Raghavan. I mimic, actually, Greg's comment about the \nway the wording of the regulation is. It is very difficult. And \nwe get it a lot in the offices: Can you just explain what this \nmeans to me?\n    And I think we have actually a great example in New York. \nYou may have heard we have the New York Mets as one of our \nteams. They built a new stadium, but what people did not \nrealize is by building a new stadium it has auto body shops. We \nhave the largest bunch of auto body shops in the country, 300 \nof them that employ over 1,000 people, sitting behind the \nstadium.\n    So when Citi Field was built, they obviously asked to get \nrid of these people, and the City of New York gave some money. \nBut one of the things that they did not talk about is how do \nyou position 300 auto body workers into a different area, 300 \nauto body workers.\n    They have been working with us, the SBA, as well as we have \nbeen working with the city to not only get them to move to the \nBronx, where we have a huge amount of manufacturing as its \nbase, but it also has one of the highest rates of unemployment, \nat 19.2 percent, and move 1,000 employees over there.\n    And one of the things we did is worked with the United Auto \nWorkers, which has a Hispanic Chamber of Commerce for auto \nworkers, to actually get them being compliant to the State, as \nwell as the city, regulation for having an auto body work shop, \nby getting the city to help them pay with their settlement fund \nto actually make sure all these auto body shops are in \ncompliance.\n    And when they move over to work, one of the things we found \nout, the biggest thing, was the language barrier. Everyone \nspeaks Spanish. So we had to go through that.\n    Also, we had 300 people trying to get funds for loans who \nhave 300 different sets of tax returns, so trying to put them \ntogether.\n    They actually have been working with SCORE as well as the \nSBA to get them all together, to make it a cooperative. And \nthey are going to buy a cooperative, buy a piece of land under \nour 504 program to actually move everything from Queens to the \nBronx.\n    But right there is a regulation. They did not even know \nthey were violating them because they were just written in \nEnglish but not English that anyone could understand. And \nactually sitting down there and actually translating, taking \nthem through that, and actually saying here are your rights and \nthis is what we can do to help actually helps a lot. So some of \nthat will actually ease that.\n    And I just wanted to comment on manufacturing and \ntechnology. You were asking what we can do. I think one of the \nprograms that we do not exploit very well is actually the \ncommercialization of technology into manufacturing.\n    We have our SBIR program. I think if you look at phase \nthree of that where about 47 percent of those who go from phase \ntwo to phase three is supposed to be for commercialization of \ntechnology.\n    And I think if we were able to link that technology and \nthat program with actually some of the manufacturing space we \nhave in the United States, we would be surpassing because we \nare actually inventing new technology that has not been out \nthere. So there are not other countries that can play in that, \nand we are one of the few countries that can do that. We have \nsome of the greatest labs.\n    I have the pleasure of having Stonybrook SBDC as part of my \nSmall Business Development Network. They have one of the only \nnano-infrared technology type of things, which I still do not \nunderstand what it does, but there are only two of them. And \nthey have four Nobel laureates working there. And you can \nimagine some of the commercialization of some of those projects \nto be out. We could be putting them not only in New York, where \nwe also have manufacturing issues, but in our neighboring \nStates and Philadelphia as well as in North Carolina.\n    So I do think if we were able to use that program, which is \nalready there, and actually link it to something else, we could \nbe winning that battle as well.\n    Ms. Dietz. Thank you. That is fantastic.\n    Lynn.\n    Ms. Douthett. To piggyback on what Pravina just said is \nthat under the SBIR program every year it is always a big \nquestion of whether or not it is going to be refunded, and that \nwas a comment that really resonated in the Startup America \nprogram. North Carolina was the first place where they held \nthat particular conference in understanding reducing barriers \nfor these technology companies, these high growth companies. So \nwe actually invited 130 companies to come, who are located \nthroughout the Research Triangle area as well as the mountains \nand the coast, to participate in giving feedback on how it is \nthat these barriers can be reduced.\n    In the small group forums that I attended, one of the \npatents and trademarks was a huge area in terms of being able \nto get that pushed through more quickly prior to other \ncountries stealing that information. Right? That was one of the \ntop things that came out, also FDA approvals.\n    I mean a lot of these companies are doing R&D here, but \ntheir greater market share is globally. It is really not here. \nSo their manufacturing costs are being recouped; the R&D costs \nare being recouped overseas, but we are really not the market \nfor that product, or creating the manufacturing of that product \nhere.\n    So there is a lot of good output and commentary that are \ngoing to come out from this regulatory barrier dialogue that \nhas happened all over the country. That will put our Federal \nagencies in a position to understand better where their \nprocesses are being clogged up, in order to free up these \ninternal processes, as well as address regulation that is \nprohibiting us from creating jobs and allowing our businesses \nto move forward.\n    Ms. Dietz. Thank you.\n    Mr. Goldberg.\n    Mr. Goldberg. I think you heard a number of DDs talk about \nstaffing issues and the need for their employees to be out in \nthe community, out with the small business, reaching out to the \nsmall businesses and the bankers, and I would like to add a \nlittle historical perspective here.\n    In the late 90s, when the agency started to downsize and \nthen streamline and centralize, we were set up as a wholesaler \nof the product. The banks made the loans, the centers processed \nthem, and we were there to tell the SBA story and to market, \nand basically to do it by getting people out from behind their \ndesk and going out into the community.\n    I think that changed, at least in the Cleveland District, \nin April of 2008. That is when the recession first started to \nhit small business, and our phones were ringing off the hook. \nSo we had to have people in the office, not just out in the \nfield, answering the needs of small business--my bank just cut \nmy line; my bank is demanding payment--and to deal with those \nsituations.\n    It is very labor intensive when you are trying to deal one-\non-one as opposed to a wholesale. We were talking to lots of \npeople all at once. So we had to balance having the staff out \nthere doing community outreach, talking to big groups and \nhaving roundtables, talking to bankers, with having enough \npeople in the office to help these individual businesses that \ncalled in and wanted us to help them find a bank.\n    I told them, we cannot find a bank for you. We cannot \nrecommend a bank, but we could point you in the right \ndirection. Come on in. We will talk to you about what the \nactual issue is, and then we will talk to some banks and work \ntogether with you.\n    That is very labor-intensive, but it also saved a lot of \nbusinesses. With the Recovery Act and the Jobs Act to follow, \nthat gave us the 90 percent guarantee and the tools to save \nthose businesses.\n    But we have to balance the need to be out in the community \nwith the need to have people in the office to help these \nbusinesses when they call, and starting in 2008 those calls \njust came in. I think I was getting five or six calls, seven, \neight, nine calls a day. The staffer were getting even double \nthat. And we had to have people in the office.\n    The last, let's say, 10 months or so those calls have \nsubsided a bit because the banks are lending some again with \nour programs. But we still have become instead of that \nwholesaler we are like a hybrid organization now out in the \nfield, where we are doing retail work as well as wholesale \nwork. And I think we need to balance the act and have the right \nstaff number to provide the service when they do call and they \ndo come in, as well as be out in the field.\n    Ms. Dietz. Thank you very much.\n    Mr. Cadena and then Ms. Nelson.\n    Mr. Cadena. Yes, I wanted to talk about the regulatory. \nThirteen years I was in New Mexico, and I am going to take a \nNew Mexico approach to this.\n    We have the two national labs in New Mexico. In New Mexico, \nfrankly, there is a lot of regulation. So the national labs \nreally provide wonderful nanotechnology, solar technology.\n    All kinds of companies start in New Mexico. Not one Fortune \n500 company is there because too much regulation, too much tax, \ntoo much everything. They go to Texas; it is a little less. Go \nto Nevada; there is nothing. You can do whatever you want. It \nis a wild West. Come on, let's play.\n    So the difference is as you have small businesses, as they \nare trying to do something, watching Texas, New Mexico and \nNevada, just everybody around, every State has different \nregulations. So it is not just Federal regulations.\n    And as Mr. Lopez was talking about, when they bring \nsomething and bring it to me--I am educated; I can read--I have \nno clue what half of those regulations are. So we not only have \nthe Federal problem, but depending on where you are at, you \nhave different State regulations that just add additional \nburden.\n    So we are moving. You know, we are not doing anything from \na national basis. We are just stirring the pot.\n    And when we are looking at trying to get increased jobs in \nAmerica, we have to make that regulatory environment less \nbecause I can assure you--and I am talking as a New Mexican--\nthat that is probably one of the hardest places to go work, yet \nwe have two national labs that are awesome, one that hopefully \nhas not burned down today during the fire.\n    There is a lot of stuff going on. But you know, that is \nwhere the Intels and the Microsofts started. They are not there \nbecause it is just too much regulation.\n    The SBIR also is a big issue; it is. Every year we would \nhave folks coming in saying, well, we will go to step one, step \ntwo, what have you. But they are concerned about well, if we \nget started, are we going to be able to go through the whole \nmix. So that uncertainty really stops people from trying.\n    I mean because there is a lot of good technology. There is \nno question. In America, especially in the State of New Mexico \nwith the two national labs, you are getting a lot of innovation \nand everything that starts.\n    But it is some of this uncertainty. You do not want to get \nin, start and then what happens when you get through step one. \nAre you going to be able to take it all the way through?\n    Then again, with your patents and your copyrights, that \nprocess, because it gets real difficult, those things need to \nbe either streamlined because that really does hurt small \nbusinesses, the innovation part, because that is what keeps \nthis country going. We are innovative.\n    I mean you know the hardest thing with working with the \nscientists, like from Stonybrook, they always--when they come \nin and they want: So how do you take it to market?\n    You know, they come in and tell you this is how. I \nunderstand how to use a cell phone, actually not completely \nbecause they change it all the time, but they want to tell you \nhow it works.\n    We do not care. We want to know how do you take it to \nmarket.\n    And the same thing with the regulatory, the regulations \nthat are out there, you read them, and they do not make any \nsense. And Greg is 100 percent right. I have read through some \nof those things and even had some of my attorneys try to \nexplain some of this stuff to us, to me, and even the legal \nopinion of the regulation does not make any sense.\n    So if that does not make any sense, then you are having a \nsmall business that has a great idea, has an SBIR. So we are \njust adding layers upon layers while our good friends in China \nand everywhere else, they just figure it out and just do it. So \nthat is something.\n    And I agree with you, Mr. Dickson, that we do need to have \nsome kind of a number to make it fair. Otherwise, all we are \ndoing is creating and innovating, and other people are building \nand making money.\n    Ms. Dietz. And that is an excellent point. Thank you.\n    Thank you, Ms. Nelson, for being so patient.\n    Ms. Nelson. Sure. Our Administrator likes to say that now \neverybody wants to dance with us. And I love to dance, but you \ncannot do it 24-7."

"","","","","    [Laughter.]\n    We have kind of the opposite problem. We have less than 3 \nmillion people spread over 51,000 square miles. And they are in \nsmall, little communities, and some of them are very isolated \nfrom broadband. You know, piping sunshine in is a problem \nsometimes.\n    But they have some skills, and what we are seeing is some \ngrassroots leadership. Mayors who have left those communities \nwhen they got old enough to get out of town, to get their \neducation and a career, retire early, come back, and they are \ntaking leadership.\n    And they are joining together in small clusters of these \nvery small communities--I am talking 500 people--and locating a \nbusiness incubator, just a small place to kind of hold and \nnurture some. We have a photographer. We have someone who does \nsome of the best craftwork you would ever see in carving wood, \nbirds. It was one of the White House ornaments.\n    They are not even aware of the services. We are trying to \nhook them up with SCORE counselors, the SBTDC and our office, \ntechnically, with Skype which we are doing through SCORE. We \ncannot possibly go there every time and share every single \nthing, but we can go and establish a relationship, and then we \ncan pipe the sunshine in through the technology.\n    But within our program, we are not able to do this. We are \nhaving to find resources, and the Arkansas Rural Development \nlooks like it is going to step up to the plate. We have worked \nwith EDA to see if they possibly could.\n    But as to the regulatory issue--and by the way, I brought \npackets. If you want boring statistics about Arkansas, you are \nwelcome to them.\n    Mr. Van Hook. That is great.\n    Ms. Nelson. So if you cannot sleep some night.\n    I am also a CPA, and for about 12 years I practiced part-\ntime. I primarily did a lot of tax, and that is the most awful \nset of regulations. I do not understand most of it.\n    I have done tax returns that were 900 pages for a very \nsmall company because of their structure, and they were not \nmaking a whole lot of money. And you can only guess how much \nthat cost them, and there is no value added, other than keeping \nthem out of IRS prison.\n    We have at least four cities that have a problem with IRS \nbecause they have not paid payroll taxes. They cannot possibly \ngo forward. We are working with the ombudsman because the \nombudsman can also help small communities, small \nmunicipalities. They will not even talk to them to come up with \na compromise plan.\n    Yes, we know we need to pay, but we cannot move forward and \nget more revenues and people and grow our communities with this \ncloud and lien on the town. IRS literally owns them.\n    Mr. Lopez. You know, I am going to have to excuse myself to \ncatch my flight.\n    Ms. Dietz. Please do.\n    Mr. Lopez. But before I leave I do want to leave you with \nsome articles about success stories from different companies, \nfrom SBA. I am very proud to say that one of the Colorado firms \nwas recognized in this.\n    But I do want to leave it with you because I think it is \nimportant for everybody to understand how well SBA approaches \nall the small businesses and to see it in writing and to see, \nhear firsthand from the small business owners because we could \nsit here all day and tell you all the success stories that we \ndeal with every single day, but I think it is important for \nthis Committee to understand the impact that we have. So I just \nwant to leave these with you.\n    Ms. Dietz. Absolutely. Thank you very much for bringing \nthem.\n    Mr. Umberger. How would you like those provided?\n    Mr. Van Hook. We can follow up with you.\n    And then I just want to end on a good note. I know that is \nhow the Chair likes us to end. I just want to point out that \nthis roundtable was a little unique because usually when we \nhave roundtable each participant is an expert on one issue. So \nI noticed when we would have a question each of your name tents \nwould go up because you are all experts on a lot of these \nissues and you are all familiar with it.\n    Then also, I just wanted to thank Julie Verratti on our \nstaff. She has been on detail for a couple of months. She \nhelped us with SBIR, trying to get it passed a few months ago, \nand she has been invaluable to our staff. And I think she also \nhelped Diane with the pronunciations.\n    Ms. Dietz. Thanks, Julie.\n    Mr. Van Hook. Yes. So, Julie, it is her last day tomorrow. \nSo she is kind of going out on a high note.\n    So we just want to thank everybody on that.\n    I do not think I had anything else to include. I just want \nto thank everybody for flying up here, taking a train, driving.\n    And then, the record is going to be open for two weeks, to \nJuly 14th. So if you have any materials, any information, any \nArkansas statistics that we can throw in there, on tourism, any \nLas Vegas convention information, we can throw that in there as \nwell.\n    Mr. Cadena. I will send you whatever you want.\n    Mr. Van Hook. Okay. We appreciate it.\n    And this meeting is adjourned."
