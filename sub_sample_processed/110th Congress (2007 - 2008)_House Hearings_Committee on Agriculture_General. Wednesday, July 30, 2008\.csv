"neugebauer","Mr. Neugebauer","","","    I thank you, Chairman Cardoza, and I \nappreciate you calling this hearing. Obviously this is a \nsubject that a lot of people have a lot of interest in. We see \na lot of folks here, and it is an important subject as well, \nand I appreciate the opportunity to review the recent events \nwith the Salmonella outbreak that has been tentatively \nassociated with fresh vegetables.\n    This was a tragic event. It is one that we hope that we can \nwork together both with the industry and this Committee and the \ngovernment to come up with ways in the future to prevent these \nkinds of episodes from happening. One of the things we do know \nis by and large Americans have enjoyed the safest food in the \nworld. We need to continue to work on that and make sure that \nprocess happens. Can we get better? I think we must. I think \nthe real fine line that we are all going to be walking here is, \nare there things that we can do, for example, on traceback to \nensure that when we do identify that there is a problem that we \ncan quickly resolve that with the least amount of disruption to \nthe marketplace and to the consumers. I think it is going to be \na cooperative effort because no one knows more about the supply \nchain than the individual companies and producers themselves. \nWe must integrate the information that they have along with \nwhat the regulatory entities in charge of food safety can \nprovide for us and work together to look at the overall system \nand say where are the weak links in this process so that we can \nindeed make them stronger. And certainly the traceback is one \nof those issues that we have had now, I believe, two different \njalapeno peppers that now have been identified as the potential \nsource for that.\n    But what we do know, as the Chairman alluded to earlier, \nthat tomatoes were originally named as the culprit and so we \ndid a widespread ban and took millions and millions of dollars \nworth, maybe even billions of dollars worth of produce off the \nmarket as a preventative measure. As it turns out at this \nparticular point in time, it was not necessary to do that. And \nso I think that also brings up the other issue as we go down \nthis road of making sure that American people have safe food \nand the processes that we might implement and the policies that \nwe may make. What we also don't want to do is cause unnecessary \nprocesses that drive up the cost of food to the ultimate \nconsumer. We have already seen a fairly substantial increase in \nfood prices for Americans. Their gasoline prices are \nincreasing. Their food prices are increasing. And so what we \nwill make sense of as we listen to the testimony of those that \nhave interest and have knowledge about this, we are going to be \nlooking for common sense solutions of using the technology that \nwe have available to us today. We will be looking at some of \nthe different places in the supply and the food chain where the \ncases of contamination are more likely to happen and see what \nwe can do in order to make that process better.\n    So I appreciate the Chairman holding this hearing. I think \nit is going to be very important. I think the American people \nare anxious to see what we can and are going to do about this. \nWith that, Mr. Chairman, I look forward to hearing from our \npanel today.\n    The Chairman. Very good. I thank the gentleman from Texas. \nHe has been a great partner in working on the issues in this \nCommittee. I would like to also say that I wholeheartedly \nconcur with him. I should have made this point at the outset of \nmy opening statement as well, that I believe that the produce \nand the food that the farmers of this country grow and produce \nfor consumption is the safest in the world. This isn't a \nquestion about indicting all of our farmers. It is a question \nof making sure that when we do have a problem, that we can \nfigure out how to correct that problem and that we continue to \nstrive for the safest possible food that we can produce. And so \nI thank the Ranking Member for making that point.\n    Now, we are going to recognize, if they come in, Mr. \nPeterson and Mr. Goodlatte as the ex officio Members, Mr. \nPeterson being the Chairman and Mr. Goodlatte being the Ranking \nMember of the full Committee, if they show up later throughout \nthe hearing, and of course, they can participate as well. The \nchair would request that other Members submit their opening \nstatements for the record so the witnesses may begin their \ntestimony and we ensure there is ample time for questions."

"","","neugebauer","Mr. Neugebauer","    Ms. DeGette. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Members \nof the Committee. My urban constituents were a little bemused \nwhen they found out that I was testifying in front of the \nAgriculture Committee but I reminded them that they are all \nconsumers too, and certainly we have an important topic today \nwith the recent foodborne disease outbreaks that we have seen.\n    Mr. Chairman, you mentioned in your opening remarks about \ndeja vu all over again with the spinach outbreak and now the \ntomato/jalapeno outbreak, which we feel the same way in the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee where we have had a series of \nfood safety hearings. While it is absolutely true that we have \nthe safest food growing and distribution system in the world, \nwe can still do better and I think that is all of our hope as \nwe fashion legislation going into the fall. This is an \nimportant hearing and it is an important topic and I think that \nwe can well address it.\n    As you may know, I have been working on traceback \nlegislation for almost 6 years now. H.R. 3485, the TRACE Act, \nwould require the USDA and the FDA to set up a food product \ntraceability system that would track foods all along the supply \nchain. Now, obviously our primary focus needs to be on \ncontinuing to build quality into the system and avoid outbreaks \nall together. Being able to fully trace tainted food is not the \nideal situation because by then the tainted food is in the \nstores and in the households and on the plates of Americans. \nBut the fact remains that we also must have procedures in place \nto deal with an emergency to get food off store shelves \nquickly, to avoid the kind of mass panic we saw in the most \nrecent outbreak of Salmonella and most importantly to prevent \nmore people from getting sick. If we did, businesses, Mr. \nNeugebauer so aptly pointed out, would save millions of dollars \nin avoiding overreaching recalls as well.\n    To a certain extent, we have limited traceability right \nnow. Most food companies know their own suppliers and customers \nand the Bioterrorism Act requires companies to have the ability \nto trace one step up and one step back. While this is a good \nstart, it is not enough because it does not fully trace food \nfrom field to fork, as we have seen all too painfully in the \nmost recent outbreak. In that case, the FDA sifted through \nboxes and boxes of paper to determine who the suppliers and \ncustomers were. In the meantime, over 14 weeks went by and over \n1,200 people got sick, not to mention the endless news stories, \ntons and tons of spoiled food and entire industries destroyed \nunnecessarily. This one outbreak has shown us that the system \nis agonizingly slow and simply incapable of keeping up with a \nglobalized food distribution system. And it is not over yet \nbecause despite the discovery of a tainted jalapeno pepper \nrecently and now another one just this week in my home State of \nColorado, the FDA cannot say with any certainty whether or not \ntomatoes were ever to blame and it still does not know where \nthe contamination occurred. Given the new warning that \nconsumers should not eat jalapenos despite their origin, it is \nobvious that we still have no idea where the tainted peppers \ncame from or were distributed.\n    Mr. Chairman, there really is a better way. As I mentioned \nbefore, H.R. 3485 would require the USDA and FDA to set up a \nsystem to trace foods throughout the supply chain. Not only is \nthis legislation technologically feasible, it is absolutely \ncritical. Now, I am not saying that the government should be in \nthe business of mandating certain technology. There are many \nways of electronically tracking foods and tracking is already \nbeing done by some companies and some industries all over the \nworld using labels, barcoding, wireless RFID readers, lasers \nand even GPS. What I do think is that the government's role is \nto standardize and coordinate. What we need is an integrated \nsystem rather than a patchwork of incomplete and incompatible \ntraceability systems. Because of the valuable public health and \neconomic benefits of full traceability, I think that the \nFederal Government must mandate these systems.\n    Now, Mr. Chairman, I will put the rest of my statement in \nthe record but let me say and let me be on record, I don't want \nto create a system that is overly burdensome for business or to \nput a whole new set of costly regulations in place that would \nburden food distributors or small farmers. Quite the contrary. \nIn fact, right now I am being approached by businesses from \naround the country that tell me they want to get going right \nnow because they want to avoid the kinds of losses that we saw \nin the tomato industry just with this latest outbreak. If you \nmeet with the FDA, if you meet with the business groups, you \nknow we do have the technology in place.\n    In the Energy and Commerce Committee, Chairman Dingell has \nput together a Chairman's markup of a food safety bill. This \nbill does not yet include traceability but I would hope as we \nmove forward in that Committee as well as in the other \nCommittees of jurisdiction, we would seriously look at having \nour Federal Government put together traceability systems that \nare interoperable and that can help us trace from field to fork \nwhere this food came from.\n    So, Mr. Chairman, I look forward to answering the questions \nof the Committee, and with that, I suppose I will yield to my \ndistinguished colleague. Thank you."

"","","neugebauer","Mr. Neugebauer","Prepared Statement of Hon. Diana DeGette, a Representative in Congress \n                             From Colorado\n    Thank you, Chairman Cardoza and Members of the Subcommittee. I \nwould like to start by thanking you for giving me the opportunity to \ntestify before this distinguished Subcommittee.\n    I also want to commend you for taking up such an important topic at \nsuch a critical time. The events over the past few months have \ncrystallized the need for a comprehensive food traceability system in \nthis country, particularly with regard to fresh produce.\n    I have been working on traceback legislation for about 6 years. \nH.R. 3485, the ``TRACE Act,'' would require the USDA and FDA to set up \na food product traceability system that would track foods at all points \nalong the supply chain.\n    In my opinion we cannot begin to address updating our nation's food \nsafety laws without looking at the ability to track our food.\n    Obviously our primary focus needs to be on building quality into \nthe system and avoiding outbreaks altogether. Being able to fully trace \ntainted food is not an ideal situation.\n    But the fact remains that we must have procedures in place to deal \nwith an emergency, to get food off store shelves quickly, avoid the \nkind of mass panic we saw in this most recent outbreak of Salmonella, \nand most importantly prevent more people from getting sick.\n    To a certain extent, we have limited product traceability right \nnow. Most food companies know their own suppliers and customers, and in \nfact the Bioterrorism Act requires companies to have the ability to \ntrace one step up and one step back. While this is a good start, it is \nnot enough, and we need to find out whether these requirements are even \nbeing enforced. And I think we can all agree that whatever traceability \nsystem that exists today certainly did not work in the tomato/pepper \nSalmonella outbreak.\n    In this case, the FDA sifted through boxes and boxes of paper \nrecords to determine suppliers and customers. In the meantime, over 14 \nweeks went by and over 1,200 people got sick--not to mention the \nendless news stories, tons and tons of spoiled food, and entire \nindustries damaged unnecessarily.\n    It has become clear that this system is agonizingly slow and simply \nincapable of keeping up with a globalized food distribution system.\n    And it's not over. Despite the discovery of a tainted jalapeno \npepper recently, the FDA cannot say with any certainty whether or not \ntomatoes were ever to blame, and it still does not know where the \ncontamination occurred. And given the new warning that consumers should \nnot eat jalapenos, despite their origin, it's obvious that they have no \nidea where the tainted peppers were distributed.\n    Mr. Chairman, there is a better way.\n    As I mentioned before, H.R. 3485 would require the USDA and FDA to \nset up a system to trace foods throughout the supply chain. Not only is \nthis legislation technologically feasible and cost effective, but it's \nabsolutely critical.\n    I am not saying that we should be in the business of mandating \ncertain technology. There is a whole host of ways to electronically \ntrack foods, and it is already being done by certain companies and \ncertain industries all over the world, using labels, bar coding, \nwireless RFID readers, lasers, even GPS.\n    Where I think the government can be useful is to help coordinate. \nWhat we need is an integrated system, rather than a patchwork of \ndifferent traceability systems. And because of the valuable public \nhealth and economic benefits to full traceability, I feel the FDA and \nUSDA have a responsibility to help.\n    We must ensure systems are interoperable and can talk to each \nother, so food can be continually tracked along the distribution \nsystem, especially when there is a transfer of ownership.\n    What I don't want to do is create a system that is overly \nburdensome for business, or to put a whole new set of costly \nregulations on our nation's food distributors or small farmers. Quite \nthe contrary. In fact, I am being approached by businesses from across \nthe country that want to get going now.\n    Full traceability is going to be good for business. IBM Consulting \nhas written a report that recommends its clients develop full \ntraceability to improve consumer confidence, which has eroded in recent \nyears due to recall after recall.\n    As we have seen in the latest Salmonella outbreak, as well as \nprevious recalls in spinach and other products, when contamination \nhappens at even a single facility, an entire industry can be \ndevastated. Despite the fact that nearly all spinach was harmless in \n2006, and the vast majority of jalapenos are probably safe now, and the \ndistinct possibility that not a single tomato was ever contaminated, \ngrowers and distributors suffered catastrophic losses.\n    Nationwide, blanket recalls and generalized consumer warnings with \nno connection to actual distribution chains create mass panic, causing \ncustomers to avoid certain products and altogether. In an industry \nwhere brand preservation is everything, we can't allow this to \ncontinue.\n    A comprehensive traceback program would allow for targeted recalls; \nif an outbreak occurs we will know exactly what lots were potentially \ncontaminated instead of targeting the entire universe of products like \nwe did with spinach, tomatoes, and peppers.\n    We can find out within seconds where tainted food was sent and \nwhere it originated, and have an orderly process of notifying affected \nconsumers and pulling products from shelves. Therefore the 99.9% of \nbusinesses selling perfectly safe food from perfectly sanitary \nfacilities will be protected against contamination that occurs \nelsewhere.\n    And electronic traceability has benefits to business that go beyond \nbrand preservation and insurance against recalls caused by other parts \nof the market. Traceability brings better inventory control and \nsupplier/customer monitoring practices, and is a good marketing \ntechnique to attract and retain customers.\n    To be sure, the outbreaks of foodborne illnesses in recent years \nhave spurned action in the private sector. Traceability systems are \nbeing implemented by industries as diverse as fresh produce and \nalcohol, from processed food to fast food, just to name a few.\n    But the USDA and FDA need to play a key role. My legislation will \nbuild upon this important work that is already happening by linking all \nof the pieces together without being overly burdensome.\n    Mr. Chairman, we cannot waste any more time postponing food safety \nreform. Why wait for the next outbreak, the next 1,200 illnesses, the \nnext mass panic that devastates our farmers, before we act?\n    There is much to be done. It is time to create a unitary food \nagency, so 12 different agencies aren't sharing the jurisdiction yet \npassing the buck. We need to provide the USDA and FDA with mandatory \nrecall authority. And we have to start rebuilding the FDA and USDA to \nbe able to better operate in a 21st Century, globalized food \ndistribution system.\n    But the latest Salmonella outbreak has shown that food traceability \nmust be a part of the mix. Consumers want to know where there food is \ncoming from, businesses need insurance against risk, and as \npolicymakers our first priority must be public health.\n    Thank you so much for the opportunity of appearing before this \nSubcommittee."

break,break,break,break
"","","neugebauer","Mr. Neugebauer","    Mr. Putnam. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. It is great \nto be back in the Agriculture Committee. I was explaining to my \ncolleague here that when I arrived, I was the next to bottom \nchair here at the kids' table embarking on that farm bill \ndiscussion back in 2001.\n    I appreciate the opportunity to be before this Subcommittee \non which I used to serve, and like you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. \nNeugebauer, Ranking Member, I am very interested in hearing \nwhat the other panels have to say in terms of what went wrong. \nClearly there was a very serious breakdown and we need to \nimprove the system as we move forward, recognizing that \nAmericans are still blessed with the safest, cheapest and most \nabundant food supply.\n    I want to spend just a little bit of time talking about the \nrecent outbreak of Salmonella and then talking about a bill \nthat I have filed with Mr. Costa, who is also a Member of the \nCommittee, from California and the work that we have done based \non the work that each of our states have done, California and \nFlorida, to really produce a seamless food safety net, \nespecially for the produce aspect of agriculture.\n    The outbreak of Salmonella Saintpaul, which is now \nestimated to have impacted over 1,300 people in 43 states, not \nonly called into question the integrity of the system designed \nto protect our food supply and the security and safety of our \nconsumers, but also significant disruptions to the network that \nproduces those agricultural goods. The aftermath, the damage \nthat was caused to the early publicly suspected commodities \nthough lasts far longer than the impact of this illness. There \nis permanent damage done to the markets, which is something \nthat is an important aspect of this discussion, that as a \nresult of early errors in the investigation, there were early \npublic statements that inaccurately identified particular \ncommodities. That is damage that transcends this discussion, \nthat transcends the illness and is permanent to those producers \nand to the market brand or image of those crops. This incident \ndemonstrated that our governing food safety authorities are \noutdated. They must be reformed and enhanced to reflect modern \nscientific standards and industry practices as well as sound \nand strong policies implemented to prevent future food \ncontamination.\n    The bill that Mr. Costa and I have introduced is called the \nSafe Food Enforcement, Assessment, Standards and Targeting Act, \nor the Safe FEAST Act, H.R. 5904, we believe it would help to \nprovide the highest level of food safety protection both for \ngoods produced domestically and those that are imported from \nabroad. As I said earlier, it is based on the success from our \nlaboratories of democracy in the states where this has been \ntried real-time, and implemented, and it is functioning well.\n    The comprehensive measure would modernize our food safety \nnetwork and put into place new food safety standards all along \nthe food chain from farm harvest, processing, packing and \ndistribution, to the retail outlet and finally to the consumer \nto identify and prevent potential sources of foodborne illness. \nThe bill calls for balanced, science-based food safety \nrequirements for farm and food companies, domestic and abroad, \nimplementing the principles of risk assessment and risk \nmanagement, to improve safeguards in our food supply as well as \nmitigate unwarranted market disruptions to agricultural \nsuppliers.\n    To ensure the highest level of food safety for the American \nconsumer, the bill requires all domestic and foreign food \ncompanies selling food in the United States to conduct a food \nsafety risk analysis that identifies potential sources of \ncontamination, outlines appropriate food safety controls and \nrequires verification that those controls that are implemented \nare adequate to address those risks of foodborne contamination.\n    Similarly, to ensure that food products coming into the \nUnited States from international sources are safe, those \nimported goods would also have to adhere to the same safety and \nquality standards as set by the FDA for what is grown in the \nUnited States. It specifically establishes new standards for \nfresh produce, putting into place for the first time mandatory \nfood safety regulations for high-risk produce and voluntary \ngood agricultural practice guidelines for the safe production \nof all fruits and vegetables.\n    For those produce items that are deemed to pose the highest \nrisk by FDA, the bill calls for the issuance of mandatory \nscience-based regulations to prevent the occurrence of \nfoodborne illness at all potential points of hazard from the \nfarm to the table. It calls on FDA to establish standards for \nthe safe production, harvesting and packaging of those types of \nfruits and vegetables for which the Secretary has determined \nare necessary to minimize the risk of serious adverse health \nconsequences.\n    These food safety initiatives have the support of the \nproduce industry. I think that that is an important piece of \nthis. This is not something that is being foisted on an \nindustry that is either technologically incapable of for \nvarious reasons in the supply chain or the production of these \ncommodities are unable to implement these new regulations. It \nhas the support of the industry, which has a stake in ensuring \nthe safety and security of their food products.\n    This issue, the spinach issue, other issues prove the \ngrowers, the farmers have as much at stake as anyone in making \nsure this doesn't happen again. I mean, your public health \nofficials and your farmers are of one mind in being committed \nto prevent this from being a future problem. It is in no one's \ninterest to continue to undermine public confidence in the \nsafety and sanctity of the nation's food supply.\n    This bill strengthens the relationship between Federal, \nstate and foreign government agencies by increasing cooperation \nto better control food safety threats, calling on the expertise \nand resources of these partners to respond to the food safety \noccurrences in a more timely and efficient manner.\n    This is the second point that I would like to make. Just as \nour bill, which was drafted long before the Saintpaul \nSalmonella outbreak, built on the success at the state level, \none of the failures, frankly, in this recent outbreak was the \nbreakdown in communication between not only industry experts \nand public health officials but state public health officials, \npeople who are charged by their state legislatures under state \nstatute with implementing food safety guidelines for their \nstates. I don't believe that in this investigation we fully \nutilized all the resources that were out there in government, \nin public health, in the industry to deal with this in a timely \nway. As time went by, more and more people got sick because we \nweren't using all the tools in our toolbox to track down or \ntraceback the source of the contamination. Time is of the \nessence and the industry and our state and local health and \nagricultural officials are on the frontline and can narrow that \nknowledge gap and close the time window when people are still \ngetting sick.\n    Collaboration with state and industry partners is key, and \nin our home State of Florida, they have adopted mandatory \nregulations on good agricultural practices and best management \npractices for the production and handling of tomatoes through \nall channels of commerce. It was developed as a cooperative \neffort between the Department of Agriculture, the Florida \nDepartment of Agriculture, the Florida tomato industry and the \nFDA and they are based on sound science. They provide \ntraceability and they establish practices and procedures for \nthe safe handling of tomatoes. These state efforts should be \nbroadened through vehicles such as this legislation, the Safe \nFEAST Act, to provide greater protection and traceability in \nour food network both at the domestic level and at the \ninternational level.\n    So, Mr. Chairman, I applaud your willingness to hold this \nhearing. I appreciate all of the Members' work in jumping on \nthis issue and attempting to get something into the law that \nmodernizes our food safety network and system. I just want to \nreiterate, it is in all of our interests to have a high \nconsumer confidence in the food supply in the United States. \nThere have been a series of incidents both in fresh produce, in \nprocessed foods, in dog food and in toys, essentially in every \naspect of the consumer's world, there have been incidents over \nthe last 2 years that have continued to undermine that level of \nconfidence. It ought to be our challenge to restore the faith \nand confidence of the American consumer and reiterate again \nthat American produce is the safest, cleanest and healthiest in \nthe world.\n    With that, I appreciate the opportunity and look forward to \nyour questions."

"","","neugebauer","Mr. Neugebauer","Prepared Statement of Hon. Adam H. Putnam, a Representative in Congress \n                              From Florida\n    I am Representative Adam H. Putnam, representing Florida's 12th \nCongressional District, and it is my privilege to provide testimony to \nthe House Subcommittee on Horticulture and Organic Agriculture on an \nissue of national significance, protecting the safety and security of \nour country's food supply.\n    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify, and I also look \nforward to the statements of those witnesses here today that serve ``on \nthe front line'' in ensuring the safety of the American food supply for \nthe public, as well as the testimony of those critical to providing \nfood resources for our country.\n    While our nation's food supply continues to be the safest in the \nworld, recent incidences of foodborne illness have highlighted \ndeficiencies in our food safety system that must be addressed.\n    The outbreak of Salmonella Saintpaul, said to be associated with \nfoodborne illness affecting in an estimated 1,284 persons, not only \ncalled into question the integrity the system designed to protect our \nnation's food supply for the safety and security of consumers, but also \ncaused significant disruptions to the food supply network and those \nthat produce agricultural goods for our nation.\n    This incident demonstrated that our governing food safety \nauthorities are outdated and must be reformed and enhanced to reflect \nmodern scientific standards and industry practices, as well sound and \nstrong policies implemented to help prevent food contamination.\n    The Safe Food Enforcement, Assessment, Standards and Targeting Act \n``Safe FEAST Act'', H.R. 5904 which I am proud to have cosponsored with \nmy colleague from California and Member of the House Agriculture \nCommittee, Representative Jim Costa, would help ensure the highest \nlevel of food safety protection for our nation's food supply, both for \ngoods produced domestically and those imported from abroad.\n    The comprehensive measure would modernize our food safety network \nand would put into place new food safety standards all along the food \nchain--from farm, harvest, processing, packing, distribution to retail \noutlet, and finally to consumers--to identify and prevent potential \nsources of foodborne illness.\n    The Safe FEAST Act calls for balanced, science-based food safety \nrequirements for farm and food companies, domestically and abroad, \nimplementing the principles of risk assessment and risk management, to \nimprove safeguards in our food supply as well as mitigate unwarranted \nmarket disruptions to agricultural suppliers.\n    The bill focuses on strengthening preventative measures, building \nupon existing regulations with tough--but common sense standards, while \nexpanding the tools of the Food and Drug administration (FDA) to more \neffectively respond to food safety incidents in this nation.\n    This bipartisan bill strengthens the relationship between Federal \nand state agencies to better control food safety threats, and for the \nfirst time, and grants FDA new authorities powers to recall \ncontaminated food in the case of adulteration.\n    By reinforcing the public-private partnership, the Safe FEAST Act \nimproves FDA's role in safeguarding and overseeing the safe production \nof food, while drawing upon the strengths of industry to meet the \nhighest food safety standards.\n    To ensure the highest level of food safety to American consumers, \nH.R. 5904 requires all domestic and foreign food companies selling food \nin U.S. to conduct a food safety risk analysis that identifies \npotential sources of contamination, outlines appropriate food safety \ncontrols, and requires verification that the food safety controls \nimplemented are adequate to address the risks of foodborne \ncontamination.\n    Similarly, to ensure that food products coming into the United \nStates from international sources are safe, imported goods would have \nto adhere to the same safety and quality standards as set by the FDA, \nthrough completing a Foreign Suppliers Quality Assurance Program, \ndocumenting the food safety measures and controls for FDA review.\n    H.R. 5904 also establishes key new standards for fresh produce. It \nimproves and expands upon FDA's Good Agricultural Practices for the \nsafe production of fruits and vegetables. For those produce items that \nare deemed to pose the highest risk, the bill calls for the issuance of \nmandatory science-based regulations to prevent the occurrence of food \nborne illness at all potential points of hazard, from farm to table.\n    While putting into place mandatory food safety standards for high-\nrisk produce, and voluntary guidelines for all other produce--the bill \nand allows for variances in FDA regulations to meet local growing \nconditions. It also directs FDA to collaborate with the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture regarding agricultural practices in the issuance of \nregulations.\n    The Safe FEAST Act strengthens the relationship between, Federal, \nstate and foreign governments agencies by increasing cooperation to \nbetter control food safety threats, calling on the expertise and \nresources of these partners to respond to food safety occurrences in a \nmore timely and efficient manner.\n    Collaboration with state and industry partners is key, as for \nexample my home State of Florida has adopted mandatory regulations on \nGood Agricultural Practices (T-GAP) and Best Management Practices (T-\nBMP) for the production and handling of tomatoes through all channels \nof commerce. Developed as a cooperative effort between the Florida \nDepartment of Agriculture and Consumer Services, the Florida tomato \nindustry, and the FDA, these best practices based upon sound scientific \nresearch, provide traceability, and establish practices and procedures \nfor the safe handling of tomatoes.\n    These state efforts should be broadened, through vehicles such as \nthe Safe FEAST Act, to provide greater protection and traceability in \nthe food supply network at the national and international level.\n    Finally, to better control food safety threats, the Safe FEAST Act \ndirects the FDA to adopt a risk-based approach to inspections, grants \nthe FDA statutory power to recall contaminated food in the case of \nadulteration, and gives FDA authority to access food safety production \nrecords during foodborne emergencies.\n    The Safe FEAST Act is endorsed by several state, national and \ninternational produce, food manufacturing and retail organizations \nwhich have a high stake in maintaining safety and quality standards for \nAmerican consumers.\n    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify, and I appreciate \nthe Subcommittee's attention to this most important issue."

We spoke yesterday with regard to the farm bill that \nhad a marketing order approach. You have a tracking approach. \nAnd the reality is, we don't see those as being out of sorts \nwith each other, that one can possibly help the other. In our \ndiscussion yesterday, we discussed that a bit and I would like \nyou to share with the Members of the Committee your views, \nsince you have worked on this so long and so hard.\n    Ms. DeGette. Mr. Chairman, I think the real key role for \nthe Federal Government is to have a traceability system that \nwhen there is evidence of a foodborne outbreak, then we have \nsome systems in place that allow immediate traceability. My \nbill, 3485, does not legislate what that system will be, and \nfurthermore, I don't think that you would necessarily have the \nsame system for each segment of the food industry. As Mr. \nPutnam wisely said, we have fresh produce, we have prepared \nfoods, we have meat, we have many other types of processes by \nwhich food enters our economy, and so my view would be rather \nthat the FDA or the USDA should by working with industry to \ndevelop systems of traceability that will take us from field to \nfork and then make sure that those systems are interoperable. I \ndon't envision one size fits all. I don't envision necessarily \none system, but part of the problem we have had is that our \nagencies have not--we have such spotty traceability throughout \nour food system that we don't have an ability to quickly trace \nfoods. This is exactly what we have seen with the latest \nfoodborne outbreak and I don't think that that is in any way at \nodds with what you are concerned with or what the legislation \nenvisioned.\n    The Chairman. Exactly. And Mr. Putnam, you raised, and I \nwould like you both to comment on this, that there is wide \nvariability between states and the capacity that each state \nhas. Certainly in California, I feel that California and \nfrankly in your State of Florida that the departments of \nagriculture in those two states probably surpass the Federal \nGovernment's capability of determining foodborne illness in a \nvery rapid fashion. I tried to get former Secretary of \nAgriculture Bill Lyons from my district to testify here today. \nHe wasn't able to make it. But because he jumped on an outbreak \nof illness in poultry, he was able to resolve the situation \nbefore it affected the commercial flocks. And if you want to \ncomment both of you about the disparities between the states \nand how you see those working in with your bills.\n    Mr. Putnam. I agree with you, Mr. Chairman, and I think \nthat is a reflection that these state departments of \nagriculture recognize the importance not only to the consumer \nbut also to the producer of avoiding these types of outbreaks \nand building consumer trust and confidence in the products that \nare being grown in those states. Because of the substantial \neconomic loss that occurs when you have these types of \nillnesses and you have these types of scares and the damage, \nthe economic damage lasts a lot longer than the life of the \nSalmonella Saintpaul bug. And so, it proves the point that I \nthink both of us are making here, which is that the industry \nrecognizes that they need a robust risk assessment, risk \nmanagement system. They have, in many cases, in these \nindividual states pressed their legislature for a more robust \nregulatory system that was also workable, that was practicable \nand technologically feasible. This is an area where the grower \nand the consumer are entirely overlapping in their interests \nand that is why the states that tend to be large specialty \ncrop-producing states, fresh produce-producing states have \ninvested heavily in that type of a modern food safety system.\n    Ms. DeGette. And just to add, I think that is the point I \nwas going to make. States like California and Florida and \nothers have really instituted very sophisticated systems, but \nthose systems are not interoperable with each other across the \nstates. If a tomato from southern California is sent to \nColorado and there is an identification by the Colorado Health \nDepartment of a foodborne outbreak, the Bioterrorism Act only \ngives us one step up and one step back. So, you can't trace \nthat tomato all the way back to the field in California, which \nis why we need a national system putting together all these \nstate systems. And just quickly let me add, an additional \nproblem that we are looking at in Energy and Commerce as well, \nit is not just the food traceability systems, it is also the \npublic health systems where there is a real patchwork of \nability to identify the contamination from the beginning that \nwe need to deal with at a Federal level.\n    The Chairman. Thank you very much.\n    Mr. Neugebauer."
"neugebauer","Mr. Neugebauer","neugebauer","Mr. Neugebauer","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank both \nof our panelists.\n    One of the things that Mr. Putnam--and I want to thank both \nof you, and I know Mr. Putnam has been a huge advocate for food \nsafety and represents a very large state that has a lot of \nproduction of citrus and fruits and vegetables for our country. \nIn your bill, as I understand it, you talk about things that \ncan be done from an agricultural perspective and then also what \nhappens to some of those agricultural products. You talk about \nsome of the authority in your bill would be given to the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, and then I heard both \nof you saying what is important here is communication, of tying \nthe network all together, the states when there is a traceback \nevent. One of the concerns I have had is where we are dividing \nfood safety responsibilities between, in some cases, two \nagencies, and then when you bring the CDC in, you bring another \nagency in there, is this an issue, is this part of the problem? \nIn other words, that you are relying on agencies, you want \nstates to communicate, you want agencies to communicate, you \nwant state agencies to communicate with Federal agencies. I \nguess the question I have, is the loop too big and would making \nthis food safety issue under one umbrella be something this \nCommittee should consider?\n    Mr. Putnam. Is that one for me?"
"neugebauer","Mr. Neugebauer","neugebauer","Mr. Neugebauer","    Either one of you.\n    Ms. DeGette. Let me say that ultimately I think we need to \nhave a conversation about whether it would make sense for us to \nhave a unitary food safety agency. This is an issue \nCongresswoman DeLauro and I have been working together on for a \nnumber of years. For example, why is it that the FDA has \njurisdiction over cheese pizzas and the USDA has jurisdiction \nover pepperoni pizzas? That has never made a lot of sense to \nme. But I think that would be a long and important discussion \nto have.\n    In the short term, we can use our current system and \nimprove it by increasing technology and communication, and I \nwill give you an example. The CDC and its related health \ndepartments and reporting agencies in the public health arena \nactually communicate pretty well right now on identification of \nfoodborne diseases and they get the information in. The problem \nis though, and we saw this with the most recent outbreak--I \nhate to harp on that because I could really pick almost any of \nthe outbreaks--once they figured out that there was a foodborne \nvector and what it was, then they reported to the FDA, which is \nthe chain of command. Then what happened was, the FDA was \nunable to target exactly was it peppers or was it tomatoes, and \nwhere did they come from, and using the Bioterrorism Act, it \njust failed completely. So if we had a system in place that you \ncould trace those tomatoes all the way back to the field or the \npeppers, that would help us go a long way in having very quick \ntraceability. That would help us at least minimize the extent \nof the business damage because we would be having big recalls \nand it would also help us quickly identify where that \ncontamination came from so we could minimize the disease.\n    Mr. Putnam. Thank you, Mr. Neugebauer. For as long as I \nhave been here and long before I got here, there has been a \ndiscussion about a single food safety agency or not. The cheese \npizza example is sort of the classic example of what is \nregulated by USDA, what is regulated by FDA, et cetera, and in \ntheory, you probably--I mean, you do look at this Byzantine \nstructure of food regulation and you say well, if we were going \nto do it all over again, that is probably not how we would do \nit. That is exactly how we approached the merger of all the \ndifferent agencies into the Department of Homeland Security, \nand I hadn't been too thrilled with how that turned out. My \nexperience from bringing that same vision to Homeland Security \nwhere we said, ``Gosh, it really doesn't make sense that you \nhave one agency looking for stuff and one agency looking for \npeople and one agency looking for bugs, and so we are going to \nmake it all into this really nice, neat, simple flow chart'', \nand it just hasn't turned out the way we all hoped it would. I \nthink that the same would be true if we were to disrupt the \nexisting food safety and regulatory system that we have today.\n    But the same bureaucratic cultures and barriers that led us \nto create the Department of Homeland Security exist today in \nthe food safety system where, for whatever reason, people are \nreluctant to pick up the phone and say, ``Hey, we happen to \nknow a lot about tomatoes, I know you guys do public health, I \nknow that you can spot anthrax or you can spot smallpox or you \nknow that the West Nile virus is increasing in intensity. But, \nmaybe you don't understand the difference between the supply \nchain of cilantro versus jalapeno peppers versus tomatoes \nversus green peppers versus red peppers.'' Maybe we ought to \nkind of break down this cultural aversion to seeking out people \nwho actually have the information about how the real world \nreally works. And in doing so, whether that involves bringing \nin industry expertise or in bringing in state and local health \nand industry expertise, I think all of those things will help \ngive us a more well-rounded system. It is not fair for Congress \nto expect the FDA or the CDC to know everything there is to \nknow about the supply chain of every commodity grown in the \nUnited States. It is not right for us to expect that of them. I \nthink it is appropriate for us to put in place a system that \nallows them to rapidly tap into the expertise that is there.\n    It is cynical to believe that asking for industry expertise \nis allowing them to be in charge of their own regulation. I \nthink that is a very cynical view because as we have seen, it \nis in their best interest more than almost anyone else's to get \nto the facts, to get to the truth, to end the spread of the \ndisease as quickly as possible and limit the damage. What is \nnot in their best interest is for government agencies to flail \naround publicly speculating about which commodity it may or may \nnot be while people change their purchasing habits based on \nthat public speculation.\n    The Chairman. I as usual agree with both of you. Thank you \nfor being here.\n    It is come to my attention that we can be expecting a vote \nany minute, so I am going to try and switch to the next panel \nand try to get the testimony of the next two panelists in as \nsoon as possible. Thank you both for being here. You testimony \nwas as enlightening as I thought it would be.\n    The next panel of witnesses we would like to invite up is \nDr. Acheson, Associate Commissioner for Food Protection of the \nU.S. Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, Maryland, and Dr. \nLonnie King, Director of the National Center for Zoonotic, \nVector-borne and Enteric Diseases, ZVED, of the Centers for \nDisease Control in Atlanta, Georgia.\n    Dr. Acheson, I would call on you to give your testimony \nfirst. You will probably hear the bells ring midway through \nyour speech but we will sit here and listen to both of you give \nyour testimony. And then hopefully we will ask you to stay \nwhile we vote and we can come back and reconvene to ask \nquestions. Dr. Acheson, the floor is yours."

break,break,break,break
"","","neugebauer","Mr. Neugebauer","    Dr. Acheson. Thank you. Good afternoon, Chairman Cardoza \nand Members of the Subcommittee, I am Dr. David Acheson, \nAssociate Commissioner for Food Protection at the Food and Drug \nAdministration, which is part of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services. Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the \nrecent foodborne illness outbreak associated with fresh produce \ncontaminated with Salmonella Saintpaul and the measures FDA is \ntaking to enhance the safety of fresh produce and to enhance \ntraceability.\n    There is no question that the Salmonella Saintpaul outbreak \ninvestigation has been one of the most complex in recent \nmemory. I want to assure you that FDA is committed to working \nwith all of our food safety partners to expedite tracebacks and \nto ensure that America's food supply continues to be among the \nsafest in the world. The number of illnesses associated with \nfresh produce is a continuing concern for FDA and we have \nworked on a number of initiatives to reduce the presence of \npathogens in these foods. Some of these activities include: \nworking with industry to develop guidance on ways to prevent or \nminimize potential contamination; conducting educational \noutreach to consumers on safe food handling practices; sampling \nand analyzing both domestic and imported produce for pathogens; \nand working with industry and foreign countries to promote the \nuse of good growing, harvesting, packing, transporting and \nprocessing practices. We are also conducting research to \nimprove the identification and detection of disease-causing \nbacteria in a variety of foods.\n    I would like to provide a brief description of the typical \ntraceback process. Once CDC and the state and local health \nauthorities, through their epidemiological investigations, \nidentify a possible food or foods associated with an outbreak, \nCDC notifies FDA. At that point, we at FDA start our traceback \ninvestigation to identify the source of the contamination. We \nwork with industry and the local, state and Federal officials \nand, when needed, foreign governments, to identify the source \nof the contamination. We do this by tracing the food suspected \nof being the vehicle for transmitting the pathogen back through \nthe supply chain from the retailer or restaurant and inspecting \nor investigating points throughout that supply chain to \ndetermine where the contamination most likely occurred.\n    Tracing food requires us to find and examine documentation \nsuch as bills of lading and invoices for the product throughout \nthe supply chain. We also obtain information on the practices \nand the conditions under which the product was stored and \nhandled at each of those points.\n    The current investigation, which initially focused on \ncertain types of raw tomatoes, provides an example of one of \nthe most difficult kinds of traceback investigations. On May \n31, the CDC advised FDA of the significant statistical \nassociation between consumption of certain types of tomatoes in \na multi-state outbreak of Salmonella Saintpaul. Raw tomatoes \nare a perishable commodity and thus are unlikely to be in the \nconsumer's home after a consumer becomes ill, obtains a \ndiagnosis and an outbreak is identified. Further, raw tomatoes \nare often sold loose without any form of packaging. In the \ncurrent investigation, we learned that many tomatoes had been \nshipped to washing, packing and repacking facilities where they \nwere or might have been commingled with other tomatoes from \ndifferent sources.\n    Since May 31, many FDA employees in the field and at \nheadquarters have been working continuously on the outbreak to \nidentify the sources of the illness. To help the public \ndistinguish tomatoes not associated with the outbreak, FDA \nadopted the policy of specifically designating the types of \ntomatoes implicated in the outbreak as well as listing growing \nareas that were not part of the outbreak. On July 17, FDA \nupdated its consumer advisory and announced that tomatoes \ncurrently on the market are not considered to be a possible \nsource of illness.\n    On July 21, a genetic match with the outbreak strain of \nSalmonella Saintpaul in jalapeno peppers we had tested from a \ndistribution center in Texas was determined. This finding of a \ngenetic match was an important break in the investigation, and \nupon further investigation, FDA determined that the \ncontamination of the peppers occurred in Mexico and not at a \nplant in Texas. Accordingly, on July 25, FDA updated its \nconsumer advisory and announced that there was no indication \nthat domestically grown jalapeno or serrano peppers are \nimplicated in the outbreak.\n    To illustrate that point, I brought a chart with me that \ndemonstrates what we learned.\n    What I would like to point out here on this chart is over \non the left-hand side, a firm was identified that is in the red \nbox. That was the site which we found the positive pepper \nsample in the McAllen, Texas, distribution center. Through our \ninvestigations in Texas, we were able to trace that back \nthrough the red dotted line to the facility at the center of \nthe diagram, which was in Mexico, and from there up to another \nfacility in Mexico and finally to the red box on the far side, \nwhich is the grower where that pepper was grown. The rest of \nthis diagram illustrates what we were learning during that \nprocess of the complexity of the potential tracebacks of \npeppers in the State of Texas.\n    Two hours ago, we learned that we had gotten breaking news \nin this regard. We have had our investigators in Mexico and \nthey had been investigating a specific farm taking samples, \nlooking for signs of the Salmonella Saintpaul outbreak, and 2 \nhours ago we learned that we had gotten a positive sample in \nboth the water used for irrigation and a sample of serrano \npeppers from the same farm that matched the outbreak strain of \nSalmonella Saintpaul. So this is a key breakthrough, and Dr. \nSolomon is going to illustrate on here which farm that was. So \nthat is a key breakthrough.\n    Now, the other thing that we have learned today from the \ninvestigation with our investigators in Mexico today----"

"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    I am sorry to interrupt but----\n    Dr. Acheson. No, sure, please.\n    Mr. Costa.--my eyes aren't what they used to be.\n    Dr. Acheson. No, I apologize for taking a few extra moments \nbut this is breaking news and I wanted you to be current.\n    The Chairman. We love breaking news here. We like to get it \nright as well. Thank you.\n    Dr. Acheson. So what we have learned is that the box there \nwith the new red square around it is where we found these two \npositive samples. We have learned also that that farm is \ndistributing to a number of other places. You can see one arrow \nalready on there, and Dr. Solomon is going to draw three more \nwhere we have now learned that this farm is distributing to a \nvariety of other places.\n    This is obviously critical information that is fresh off \nthe press as of, as I say, 2 hours. One of the key things that \nwe are learning is where the product from that farm has gone to \nand what the investigators in Mexico are going to be doing \nright now as the days move forward is identify where else might \nthose products have been distributed within the country of \nMexico before coming into the United States. And that will \neventually allow us hopefully to narrow this down to a specific \nplace.\n    Obviously one of the questions is, if we have contamination \non that farm but the pepper traced back to another farm, is \nthere a connection between the two? Is one shipping to the \nother? Is there a common water supply? We know that the \ncontamination was in the water so is there a common water \nsupply or is there some other common point? And you can see \nthere again in the middle of that diagram, there is a \ndistribution center--Dr. Solomon, if you could point to that, \ndown one, there--where the peppers on the top part of the \ndiagram and the positives are passing through the same \ndistribution center.\n    Based on this, we are right now expanding our message to \nconsumers. We found a positive in serrano peppers and we are \nrecommending that consumers in the United States not only not \nconsume jalapeno peppers imported from Mexico but also serrano \npeppers.\n    The Chairman. So is that a new advisory that will be going \nout today?\n    Dr. Acheson. It is a new advisory as of right now, yes, \nindeed, because we have now gotten a confirmed positive in \nserrano peppers as well as jalapeno peppers, so both kinds of \npeppers have tested positive for the outbreak strain. So the \nmessage will be to consumers to avoid those kinds of peppers or \nproducts made from fresh--these are fresh peppers. As before, \nif they are processed, cooked or pickled, then they are not of \nconcern.\n    So that essentially is an update. I have already gone way \nover my time. I recognize that, so I would be happy to take any \nquestions when you are ready."

"","","costa","Mr. Costa","    Last month, the Secretary announced that the Administration is \nincreasing its Fiscal Year (FY) 2009 budget request for FDA by $275 \nmillion. This increase brings the Administration's total proposed \nincrease in FDA's budget, including user fees, for FY 2009 to $406.3 \nmillion, a 17.9% increase over FY 2008. A large portion of this \nincrease ($125 million) will be used for food safety and will allow FDA \nto intensify actions to implement the Food Protection Plan. This is in \naddition to the $42.2 million increase proposed for food protection in \nthe budget announced in February 2008.\n    On June 30, the President signed the FY 2008 Supplemental \nAppropriation into law. This appropriation act provided $150 million \nfor FDA, and these resources will allow FDA to accelerate its \ntransformation of its regulatory strategies to meet the challenges of \nthe evolving global marketplace for food and medical products. The \nfunds in the supplemental appropriations act will allow FDA to further \nimplement the Food Protection Plan, the Action Plan for Import Safety, \nand important medical product priorities. It will specifically allow \nFDA to expand its food safety activities, such as increasing \ninspections, performing research on mechanisms of food contamination, \nestablishing offices overseas to build capacity with our foreign \npartners, developing and validating more rapid detection tools, \nenhancing our information technology systems to support interoperable \ndatabases, and enhancing FDA's ability to identify and target the \ngreatest threats from intentional and unintentional contamination.\nConclusion\n    FDA is working hard to ensure the safety of food, in collaboration \nwith its Federal, state, local, tribal, and international food safety \npartners, and with industry, consumers, and academia. As a result of \nthis effective collaboration, the American food supply continues to be \namong the safest in the world. However, the Salmonella Saintpaul \nfoodborne illness outbreak underscores the challenges we face. Once our \ninvestigation has determined the cause of the Salmonella contamination, \nwe will examine what other measures are needed.\n    In the meantime, we have been making progress and are moving \nforward to implement the Plans. We recently issued 6 month updates that \ndemonstrate the specific actions we have been taking to implement the \nPlans. For example, we have formed a Risk-Based Steering Committee with \nthe charge of ensuring that a comprehensive risk-based approach is \ntaken with regard to food protection. We are holding a 50 state meeting \nin August to share information and develop strategies for implementing \nthe Food Protection Plan and to enhance future collaborations between \nFederal, state, and local partners. Progress also has been made in \nidentifying food vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies; for \nexample, FDA has identified several natural plant bacteria that are \neffective in preventing contamination of tomatoes with Salmonella \nNewport. FDA scientists received training and instruments to rapidly \ndetect and accurately identify Salmonella serovars using a new \nmolecular method. We have strengthened the response to food safety \nthreats by providing incident command system training to our FDA \noffices around the country and to states and by developing templates to \nenhance communication during a food recall. We will continue to strive \nto reduce the incidence of foodborne illness to the lowest level \npossible.\n    Thank you for the opportunity to discuss FDA's continuing efforts \nto enhance food safety and traceability. I would be happy to answer any \nquestions."

"","","costa","Mr. Costa","    Dr. King. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon. I am \nLonnie King. I am the Director of the National Center for Zoonotic, \nVector-borne and Enteric Diseases at the CDC. Thank you for the \ninvitation to address the Subcommittee today.\n    First, let me offer my sympathies to all families who have been \nadversely affected by this outbreak and also I understand the \nfrustration of many of the food-producing and serving industries who \nwork so very hard to produce and serve safe produce.\n    CDC leads Federal efforts to gather data and investigate foodborne \nillnesses. Much of what CDC does depends on the critical relationships \nwith a broad range of partners, food safety regulatory agencies, in \nparticular with the FDA, the USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service and \nwith the state and local public health departments.\n    Salmonella is a group of bacteria that is widespread, mostly in the \nintestines of birds, reptiles and mammals. There are some 2,500 \nsubtypes, or serotypes. Salmonella is the second most common bacterial \ncause of foodborne illness in this country. The current outbreak of \nSalmonella caused by the serotype Saintpaul is relatively uncommon as a \nserotype, causing only about one percent of all reported Salmonella \ninfections each year. This outbreak is the largest foodborne outbreak \nin the United States in the past decade. Its investigation has been \nespecially complex, difficult and, unfortunately, prolonged.\n    CDC first learned about the outbreak on May 22, 2008, when the New \nMexico Department of Health reported illnesses in four individuals \nconfirmed as Salmonella Saintpaul. New Mexico posted the information \nabout this unusual number of Salmonella Saintpaul cases to PulseNet, a \nnational network of public health and food regulatory agency \nlaboratories used to detect foodborne disease outbreaks. This \ninformation allowed state laboratories to compare the specific DNA \nfingerprint found in New Mexico to their own cases of Salmonella and to \nreport any cases where there may be matching fingerprints. The very \nnext day, Texas and Colorado reported cases with matching fingerprints. \nInvestigators in New Mexico, Texas and CDC began a multi-state outbreak \ninvestigation. Epidemiologists conducted hypothesis-generating \ninterviews with ill persons to collect information about many possible \nsources of infection. Results of this first series of interviews \nindicated raw tomatoes were the most commonly consumed food, leading to \nthe hypothesis that they are possible source of illness. Following \nthese initial interviews, case control studies comparing what ill and \nhealthy persons reported eating were conducted. By May 31, preliminary \nresults of the first case control study showed that illnesses were \nsignificantly associated with the consumption of raw tomatoes.\n    On June 4, CDC received the first report of a possible restaurant \ncluster and subsequently learned of additional clusters. Between June \n18 and June 20, there was also a large surge of reported cases from \nTexas. The geographic concentration of illness in the Southwest and in \nNative American and Hispanic persons along with a strong association \nwith the consumption of Mexican-style food in restaurants and the \napparent continuation of this outbreak after the alert regarding \ntomatoes led to the hypothesis that a food item commonly consumed with \ntomatoes could also be producing this illness.\n    Investigations then focused on the recently identified clusters and \na second multi-state case control study of persons who became ill after \nJune 1 was initiated. The results of the case control study indicated a \nstrong link to fresh produce items used in Mexican cuisine but did not \npoint clearly to a specific item. After additional epidemiologic \ninvestigations of a cluster of illness in Texas, the FDA began their \ntracebacks on peppers, and on June 21, the FDA announced they had \nisolated the outbreak strain of Salmonella Saintpaul from a sample of \njalapeno peppers, and we now know that other information has come \nforward. This outbreak continues as does the investigation. The active \nfield investigations by the CDC, state and local health departments \nfocusing on identifying clusters of cases and the FDA's tracebacks on \njalapenos, tomatoes and other possible sources are providing new \ninformation almost on a daily basis.\n    This outbreak has been particularly challenging. First, there is an \ninherent delay when a person becomes ill with Salmonella and when \nresults of the tests are reported to PulseNet. For half the cases in \nthis outbreak, it took more than 16 days from onset of illness to \nposting the test results on PulseNet. Second, people have difficulty \nremembering exactly what foods they ate and remembering specific \ningredients in those foods was even more difficult, especially in \ndishes that were prepared by someone else. Third, the foods in question \nare often eaten together, so exposures to one item often means \nexposures to all the items. Finally, perishable foods consumed by ill \npersons were often not available for testing.\n    As of July 29 at 9 p.m., 1,319 persons infected with Salmonella \nSaintpaul have been identified in 43 states, the District of Columbia \nand Canada. At least 255 persons have been hospitalized with two deaths \npossibly linked to this outbreak. At present, we believe that jalapeno \npeppers are the cause of some of these clusters and could be a major \nvehicle that we need to look at as part of this outbreak. Fresh serrano \npeppers, with this new information today from FDA, not only remain \nunder investigation but now we have a smoking gun, it appears.\n    It also appears likely that more than one food vehicle has been \ninvolved in this outbreak. I think that has been confirmed by FDA \ntoday. By themselves, tomatoes cannot explain this entire outbreak nor \ndo jalapeno peppers explain all of the clusters. The outbreak is \nongoing but fortunately fewer new illnesses are reported each day.\n    In conclusion, the outbreak illustrates the importance of existing \npublic health networks: the laboratories that use and perform PulseNet \nfingerprinting; the epidemiologists conducting the investigations; the \nmultidisciplinary approach to the investigation and the close \ncommunication and collaboration among state, local and Federal \nofficials. We balance the rapid release of information on the sources \nof illness against the potential negative consequences to consumers, \nfood growers, producers and industry. CDC is prepared to continue to \nwork with its regulatory authorities, state and local partners, food \nand environmental microbiologists and the food industry to find long-\nterm solutions to this very challenging problem.\n    I appreciate being here today, and your kind invitation to testify. \nAfter your vote I would be happy to answer any questions you may have."

"","","costa","Mr. Costa","Prepared Statement of Lonnie J. King, D.V.M., Director, National Center \n for Zoonotic, Vector-borne, and Enteric Diseases, Centers for Disease \n Control and Prevention, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \n                            Washington, D.C.\nIntroduction\n    Good afternoon, Chairman Cardoza and Members of the Subcommittee. I \nam Dr. Lonnie King, Director of the National Center for Zoonotic, \nVector-borne, and Enteric Diseases, at the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention. Thank you for the invitation to address the \nSubcommittee on CDC's activities related to the prevention of foodborne \ndisease and CDC's role in the response to the current outbreak of \nSalmonella Saintpaul infections associated with fresh produce. First, \nlet me offer my sympathies to all the families who have been adversely \naffected by this outbreak. Second, I understand the frustration of many \nin the food producing and serving industries, who work very hard to \nproduce and serve safe produce. This investigation has been especially \ndifficult and prolonged. We have faced many challenges with this \nparticular foodborne outbreak. I will discuss these challenges in more \ndetail after describing the CDC's response to the Salmonella Saintpaul \noutbreak.\nBackground\n    Foodborne disease presents a continuing challenge to public health. \nCDC estimates that approximately 76 million U.S. residents get sick, \n325,000 are hospitalized, and 5,000 die each year from foodborne \nillness. Overall, foodborne diseases appear to cause more illnesses but \nfewer deaths than previously estimated in the 1980's. More than 250 \ndifferent foodborne illnesses have been described. Most are caused by a \nvariety of bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Some foodborne illnesses \nare caused by toxins or chemicals.\n    As an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services \n(HHS), CDC leads Federal efforts to gather data on foodborne illnesses, \ninvestigate foodborne illnesses and outbreaks, and monitor the \neffectiveness of prevention and control efforts. CDC is not a food \nsafety regulatory agency but works closely with the food safety \nregulatory agencies, in particular with HHS's Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) and the Food Safety and Inspection Service within \nthe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). CDC also plays a \nkey role in building state and local health department epidemiology, \nlaboratory, and environmental health capacity to support foodborne \ndisease surveillance and outbreak response. Notably, CDC data can be \nused to help document the effectiveness of regulatory interventions.\n    Much of what CDC does depends on critical partnerships with state \nand local public health departments who collect surveillance data and \ninvestigate most outbreaks themselves. CDC has worked with the \nAssociation of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) and the Council of \nState and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) to strengthen networks for \nfoodborne disease surveillance. For example, PulseNet, the national \nnetwork for molecular subtyping of foodborne bacteria coordinated by \nCDC, empowers every state health laboratory to test strains of bacteria \nfrom sick persons in that state, and to compare them with DNA \n``fingerprint'' patterns in the national database at CDC. This has \ngreatly improved the ability to detect clusters of illness that may be \nrelated, even if they are dispersed across multiple states.\n    OutbreakNet is the group of public health officials at state health \ndepartments and CDC who regularly investigate foodborne outbreaks. The \nOutbreakNet team at CDC coordinates the investigation of the large, \nmulti-state clusters and works with the foodborne disease \nepidemiologists in each state to evaluate clusters that PulseNet \ndetects. The OutbreakNet team at CDC also manages the electronic \nFoodborne Outbreak Reporting System (eFORS). Established in 2001, eFORS \nis a web-based outbreak surveillance system through which state and \nlocal health departments voluntarily submit completed reports of \nfoodborne disease outbreak investigations to CDC.\n    CDC's Environmental Health Specialists Network (EHS-Net), a \ncollaborative effort with FDA and nine states, assists state health \ndepartments in their efforts to improve the practice of environmental \nhealth service programs; participants assess policies and practices of \nretail foodservice establishments that could lead to or prevent \nfoodborne outbreaks. FoodNet is a network that is a collaborative \neffort among CDC, ten states who participate in CDC's Emerging \nInfections Program, the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and \nInspection Service (USDA-FSIS), and FDA; it provides the most accurate \nsurveillance data for determining the burden of infections, conducts \nscientific studies to better understand the sources for the many \nillnesses that occur outside the outbreak setting, and monitors trends \nin infections as new control measures are instituted. We have PulseNet \nto detect possible outbreaks, OutbreakNet to investigate and report \nthem, and FoodNet to track general trends and define where more \neffective prevention strategies are needed.\n    CDC also works with a broad range of other partners to improve \ncapacity and knowledge regarding foodborne disease control and \nprevention. In collaboration with the National Environmental Health \nAssociation (NEHA), CDC conducts team training programs for local and \nstate health department officials including specialists in \nenvironmental health, laboratory, and epidemiology. CDC works with the \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) and a variety of other international \npartners to conduct similar training programs in other countries \nthrough the WHO Global Salmonella Surveillance program. CDC supports \nthe Council to Improve Foodborne Outbreak Response (CIFOR) which was \ncreated to help develop model programs and processes that will \nfacilitate the investigation and control of foodborne disease \noutbreaks. CSTE and the National Association of County and City Health \nOfficials (NACCHO) are co-chairing CIFOR, and it includes \nrepresentatives from CDC, FDA, USDA, APHL, NEHA, the Association of \nState and Territorial Health Officials, and the Association of Food and \nDrug Officials.\nSalmonella\n    Salmonella is a group of bacteria that is widespread in the \nintestines of birds, reptiles, and mammals. Salmonella bacteria have \nbeen known for over 100 years to cause human illness. Salmonella is the \nsecond most common bacterial cause of foodborne diseases in the \ncountry, causing 15 reported laboratory-confirmed infections per \n100,000 population in 2007, as measured in FoodNet. There are many \ndifferent kinds, or serotypes, of Salmonella bacteria. Serotyping is a \nclassification system based on differences in structures on the \nsurfaces of bacteria or other disease-causing agents. Serotyping \ndivides Salmonella into more than 2500 different serotypes, some common \nand some rare. For example, during 1996-2006, Salmonella serotype \nTyphimurium and Salmonella serotype Enteritidis typically caused 41% of \nreported Salmonella illnesses each year in the United States. \nSalmonella serotype Saintpaul is relatively uncommon, causing only 1% \n(about 400) of all reported laboratory-confirmed Salmonella infections \neach year. Each serotype can be further sub-divided into many more \nsubtypes based on their DNA.\n    Salmonella infections have often been associated with meat, \npoultry, eggs, and raw milk; these products are derived from animals \nthat can carry Salmonella. Salmonella has also been associated with \nfresh produce and other plant-derived foods. Fresh produce can be an \nimportant source of other types of foodborne infections as well; for \nexample, Escherichia coli O157, another bacterial agent, caused a large \noutbreak of illness linked to spinach in 2006. Salmonella, like other \npathogens that are commonly foodborne, can also be transmitted in other \nways, such as from contact with reptiles or other animals or between \nchildren at a child care center.\n    Many foodborne infections, including Salmonella, occur in persons \nwithout obvious connections to each other. These are called sporadic \ncases; determining the source of a single sporadic case can be very \ndifficult. Cases of similar infections can also occur as a group or \n``cluster.'' Epidemiological investigation of clusters of possibly \nrelated cases permits public health officials to determine if the cases \nwere connected and, specifically, if they were linked to food. A \ncluster of foodborne illnesses is considered an outbreak if an \ninvestigation demonstrates that two or more infections caused by the \nsame agent are linked to the same food.\n    In general, for a foodborne illness to be recognized by the public \nhealth surveillance system, a patient must seek medical attention, the \nphysician must decide to order diagnostic tests, and the laboratory \nmust conduct the test using the appropriate procedures and report the \nresults to a health department. Many ill people do not seek medical \nattention, and of those who do, many are not tested. Therefore, many \ncases of foodborne illness are neither diagnosed nor reported. For \nexample, Salmonella infection has been estimated to cause about 1.4 \nmillion foodborne illnesses annually, however, only about 40,000 \nlaboratory-confirmed cases of Salmonella are reported to CDC each year.\n    Regular reporting about detection of Salmonella serotypes from ill \npersons is critical in determining whether a change in incidence has \noccurred signaling a possible outbreak. Each serotype can be further \ndivided by DNA analysis into subtypes. The subtypes are distinguished \nby different DNA fingerprint patterns. The fingerprint pattern is \ndetermined with a test known as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis \n(PFGE). PFGE is a very good method for discriminating between \nepidemiologically unrelated isolates of this serotype. Public health \nlaboratories determine the serotype and PFGE patterns for Salmonella \nstrains and share the patterns through PulseNet. PulseNet plays a vital \nrole in surveillance for and investigation of widely dispersed \nfoodborne illness outbreaks that were previously difficult to detect. \nThe laboratories participating in PulseNet are in state health \ndepartments, some local health departments, USDA, and FDA. When a \nclinical laboratory detects Salmonella from an ill person, a sample is \nsent to a state or local PulseNet laboratory where it is serotyped and \nDNA fingerprinted. The laboratory compares the fingerprint pattern to \nthat of other Salmonella strains from people in that area and uploads \nthe pattern electronically to the national PulseNet database maintained \nat CDC, where it can be compared with the patterns from all over the \ncountry. This gives us the capability to detect an unusual number of \nSalmonella cases with the same pattern in a single area or in multiple \nstates. The system can identify patterns even if the affected persons \nlive far apart, which is important given the widespread U.S. food \ndistribution systems. The pattern causing the current outbreak is \nusually quite uncommon, and was identified only 25 times in 2007, among \nthe 400 Salmonella Saintpaul infections that were reported.\n    It is important to recognize there is an inherent delay between \nwhen a person becomes ill with Salmonella infection and when the \nresults of testing are reported to PulseNet. In the current Salmonella \nSaintpaul outbreak, the median number of days between when the illness \nbegan and when the fingerprint pattern was reported to PulseNet has \nbeen 16 days. It takes time for a person to become ill, seek medical \ncare, submit a sample for testing; it then takes time for the clinical \nlaboratory to detect Salmonella and send the strain to the public \nhealth laboratory; it then takes time for the public health laboratory \nto perform serotyping and DNA fingerprinting.\nThe Salmonella Saintpaul Outbreak\n    On May 22, 2008, the New Mexico Department of Health contacted CDC \nto report that they were investigating illness in four persons with \nSalmonella Saintpaul strains that had the same DNA fingerprint pattern, \nand that Salmonella strains from 15 more persons were still being \ncharacterized. The DNA fingerprint determined by PFGE was rare. It \nusually occurs no more than 2-3 times a month in the whole United \nStates, so four or more in one location was unexpectedly high. New \nMexico posted the information about the unusual number of Salmonella \nSaintpaul cases to the PulseNet web board on May 22, so that all state \nlaboratories could quickly compare the DNA fingerprint pattern with \nthat of their own strains, and CDC requested that states report any \nstrains that matched the DNA fingerprint pattern. That next day, Texas \nand Colorado reported cases with this PFGE pattern, and investigators \nin the New Mexico Department of Health, the Navajo Nation, the Indian \nHealth Service, the Texas Department of State Health Services, and CDC \nbegan a multi-state investigation. Daily multi-state conference calls \nbegan and continued through July, with states being added to the calls \nas their cases were identified. The investigation was initially \ncoordinated by the New Mexico State Health Department, because most \nidentified cases were in that state. On June 3, after more states in \ndifferent regions of the country reported cases, CDC assumed this role \nof the investigation.\n    The initial steps in an epidemiological investigation are to \ncollect information from which hypotheses can be generated about the \npossible source of the outbreak. As cases with the same DNA fingerprint \npattern were identified, epidemiologists interviewed patients to \ndetermine what specific foods or other exposures they may have had in \ncommon. The New Mexico Department of Health, Texas Department of State \nHealth Services, and the Indian Health Service conducted hypothesis-\ngenerating interviews from mid to late May among 19 ill persons from \nwhom Salmonella Saintpaul with the DNA fingerprint matching the \noutbreak strain had been isolated during May 2008. These interviews \ncollected information about possible sources of infection, including \nattendance at gatherings, travel, daycare contact, contact with \nreptiles and/or other household pets, contact with farm animals, \nsources of drinking water, history of swimming, eating at restaurants, \nand specific food consumption history for approximately 200 food items; \nthe interviews also included open-ended questions about what ill \npersons had eaten, meal by meal, in the days before they became ill. \nThe preliminary results of this first series of interviews indicated \nraw tomatoes were the most commonly consumed food item (reported by 84% \nof ill persons) leading to the hypothesis that they were a possible \nsource of the illnesses. CDC informally advised the FDA on May 26 of \nthe hypothesis of a possible association between ill persons and the \nconsumption of raw tomatoes.\n    In the next steps of the investigation, analytic epidemiologic \nstudies were conducted to test the hypotheses generated by case \nfinding. These studies compare the frequency with which ill persons \nreport exposure to a particular food item to the frequency with which \nhealthy persons (or controls) report that exposure. If the ill group is \nmore likely than the well group to report exposure to a particular \nfood, a statistical test can show how likely this finding would have \noccurred by chance alone. Additional information about the likelihood \nof that particular food actually being contaminated, the biological \nplausibility of it causing the illnesses, the fit of the cases with the \ndistribution of the food, and other factors may enter into the \nprofessional judgment of whether the food with a statistically \nsignificant association with cases is likely to explain the outbreak. \nPreliminary findings from these types of studies guided subsequent next \nsteps of the investigation while additional statistical analyses are \nbeing conducted on the data gathered. It is important to keep in mind \nat this stage of investigation, as analyses are conducted and \ninterpreted, that initial findings and hypotheses may change. As is \ncommon in outbreak investigations but especially true for foodborne \noutbreaks, the process of case finding, hypothesis generating, and \nhypothesis testing is an iterative process; each step informs \nsubsequent steps and often leads to new investigative avenues.\n    In the next phase of the investigation, in late May, the New Mexico \nDepartment of Health, the Texas Department of State Health Services, \nand the Indian Health Service, in consultation with CDC, conducted a \nmulti-state case-control study. The data from the earlier 19 hypothesis \ngenerating interviews were used to identify which foods were most \nfrequently consumed by the ill people. The questionnaire used in this \ncase-control study included the 14 foods \\1\\ reported by half or more \nof the ill people in the hypothesis-generating interviews. These \nquestionnaires were administered to approximately 150 people. By May \n31, preliminary results of the case-control study demonstrated that \nillness was significantly associated with consumption of raw tomatoes \n(88% of cases consumed raw tomatoes compared with 64% of the controls, \na very strong statistical difference). FDA was formally notified of \nthis significant association between tomatoes and infection. \nStatistical analysis of these data showed that illness was associated \nwith consumption of raw tomatoes independent of consumption of tomatoes \nin salsa, guacamole, or pico de gallo.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\1\\ Food items examined included tomatoes, eggs, ice cream, \npotatoes, milk, tortillas, cold breakfast cereal, raw onions, salsa, \navocado, guacamole, ground beef, chicken, and lettuce.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    The next step in the investigation was to trace the implicated food \nback to its sources, looking for points where contamination might have \noccurred, and to determine if there is a single farm, processing \nlocation, or other point in distribution system that could explain all \nthe illnesses providing additional evidence supporting the food item as \na cause of the outbreak. Tracing the implicated food back from \nconsumption through preparation, to distributors, and source can also \nhelp determine how the contamination occurred, stop distribution of the \ncontaminated product, and prevent further outbreaks from occurring. On \nMay 31, 2008, FDA decided to initiate investigations attempting to \ntrace the tomatoes reported to have been eaten by ill persons back to \ntheir sources. Tracebacks began on June 1, 2008. Throughout the \ninvestigation there has been ongoing communication between CDC and FDA \nregarding these traceback investigations.\n    On June 4, CDC received the first report of a possible restaurant \ncluster. Four cases in Illinois appeared to be related to exposure to a \nsingle restaurant. Such clusters were otherwise absent in the early \npart of the outbreak. The outbreak continued and expanded. Over the \nnext few weeks, hundreds more cases were reported from an increasing \nnumber of states. The average number of persons who became ill between \nMay 20 and June 10 was 33 per day. New information emerged as each case \nwas reported and interviewed by local or state health department \nauthorities.\n    On June 16, CDC learned about the first recognized large cluster \nlinked to a single restaurant, approximately 30 illnesses, in Texas. \nBetween June 18 and June 20, Texas reported an additional 134 cases. \nThis surge in the number of cases from Texas highlighted the geographic \nconcentration in the Southwest and in Native American and Hispanic \npersons, which did not have a clear explanation. This information, \nalong with the strong association between illness and consumption of \nMexican-style foods in restaurants coming from continued analysis of \nthe case-control studies, and the apparent continuation of the outbreak \nafter the alert regarding tomatoes, led to the hypothesis that a food \nitem commonly consumed with tomatoes could be causing illnesses. \nEpidemiologists decided to focus the investigations on the recently \nidentified clusters and to conduct a case-control study of persons \nnationwide who became ill in June. CDC offered assistance to the Texas \nDepartment of State Health Services; a CDC Epi-Aid team arrived in \nTexas on June 19.\n    By July 7, 32 clusters of Salmonella Saintpaul infections with the \nPFGE pattern of the outbreak strain had been identified in 13 states \nand the District of Columbia. Twenty-six were associated with Mexican-\nstyle restaurants. Most clusters had fewer than five ill persons. Three \nclusters had more than ten ill persons, and analytic studies have been \nconducted on these. In one of these larger restaurant clusters, \nillnesses were linked to consumption of an item containing fresh \ntomatoes and fresh jalapeno peppers. In the other two, illnesses were \nlinked to an item containing fresh jalapeno peppers but neither raw \ntomatoes, nor fresh cilantro. Among the 22 smaller clusters with data \non the presence of food items in the venue, four did not serve jalapeno \npeppers. Together, these investigations indicated that jalapeno peppers \ncaused some illnesses, but did not appear to explain all illnesses. Raw \ntomatoes, fresh serrano peppers, and fresh cilantro also remained under \ninvestigation. We were strongly considering the probability that more \nthan one food item caused illness.\n    CDC and state and local health departments conducted a second case-\ncontrol study to investigate the possibilities that illness was related \nto consuming foods in Mexican-style restaurants, and that illness was \nassociated with consuming, in a restaurant, event, or home, a range of \nproduce items that are often served with tomatoes, including freshly \nmade salsa, fresh jalapeno peppers, and fresh cilantro. This was a \nlarge multi-state study, with over 400 interviews, with 141 interviews \nfrom persons who had become ill on or after June 1 and 281 interviews \nfrom healthy controls available for preliminary analysis. The study \nshowed that illness was strongly associated with eating at a Mexican-\nstyle restaurant. In a preliminary statistical analysis that considered \nthe entire dataset, consumption of fresh tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, \nand cilantro were each shown to be risk factors in subgroups but no \nsingle suspect exposure statistically dominated the others in \nexplaining all cases. Thus, this study indicated a strong link to fresh \nproduce items used in Mexican cuisine but did not point clearly to one \nspecific item.\n    As new restaurant-associated clusters were reported, CDC and state \nhealth departments investigated them aggressively. By July 16, CDC \ninvestigators were assisting state and local health officials in field \ninvestigations of restaurant clusters in North Carolina, Missouri, \nTexas, and New York City. In addition, another CDC team was \ninvestigating illnesses in New Mexico.\n    As the epidemiological investigation expanded, the FDA also \nexpanded their traceback and sampling efforts. FDA began their \ntracebacks on peppers identified by the outbreak investigations \nconducted by the states and CDC. CDC sent two medical epidemiologists \nto FDA to directly participate in analyzing findings from the \ntracebacks and connect them with the CDC epidemiologic data. On July \n21, the FDA announced that they had isolated the outbreak strain of \nSalmonella Saintpaul from a sample of jalapeno peppers. The \nepidemiologic data from a Texas cluster of ill persons led to this \nspecific traceback investigation. In most Salmonella outbreaks that are \nlinked to a particular food, however, Salmonella is never detected in \nthe food. Detection of Salmonella in a food item that was implicated in \nan epidemiologic study provides strong evidence that this food item \ncaused illnesses, though it does not exclude other foods as possible \ncauses of illness.\n    Throughout the investigative process, to ensure that information \nwas disseminated to the public as accurately and quickly as possible \nabout health threats and other information related to this outbreak, \nCDC and FDA coordinated their communication strategies and messages and \ndiscussed these strategies in daily calls with state health officials. \nWe balance the rapid release of information on sources of illness \nagainst the potential negative consequences to consumers, food growers, \nproducers, and industry. Continued collaborations and communications \nbetween Federal agencies, state and local health departments, and all \nrelevant stakeholders are essential.\nChallenges Confronting the Outbreak Investigation\n    Every outbreak response is a challenge for everyone involved. This \noutbreak was particularly challenging in a number of ways. As already \nmentioned, it takes time for a case to be reported to public health \nauthorities and then investigated. For half the cases in this outbreak, \nit took more than 16 days from when the person became ill to the when \nthe DNA fingerprint of their Salmonella was added to the PulseNet \ndatabase. The resulting delay sometimes prevented interviews from \noccurring while memories were still fresh. The precision of interviews \nby epidemiologists depend on the observations and memories of people \nabout what they ate and what ingredients the dishes contained. People \noften have difficulty remembering exactly what foods they ate, and \nremembering specific ingredients in those foods is even more difficult, \nespecially if the dish was prepared by someone else, or eaten in a \nrestaurant. Another challenge has been that the foods in question are \noften eaten together--many salsa, guacamole, and pico de gallo recipes \ncontain tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, and cilantro, so exposure to one \nitem often means exposure to all three. When food items are mixed \ntogether and consumed in the same dish, all the items may be \nstatistically linked to illness. In that case, it can be difficult or \nimpossible to separate out the risk from individual foods without \nadditional information such as microbiological culture or traceback of \nthe foods. Although laboratory testing of foods might help identify the \nsource of an outbreak, perishable foods that were consumed by ill \npersons were often not available to test. This is in contrast to \noutbreaks from frozen or processed foods which may still be present in \nsomeone's freezer or pantry weeks later. Finally, the traceback of \nfresh produce, such as tomatoes, through the supply chain can be very \ndifficult and labor intensive. Doctor Acheson will be able to say more \nabout this.\nStatus of Investigation\n    As of July 27, 1304 persons infected with Salmonella Saintpaul with \nthe same fingerprint have been identified in 43 states, the District of \nColumbia, and Canada. At least 252 persons were hospitalized. Two \ndeaths were possibly linked to the outbreak: A man in his eighties who \ndied in Texas from cardiopulmonary failure had an infection with the \noutbreak strain at the time of his death. A man in his sixties who died \nin Texas from cancer had an infection with the outbreak strain at the \ntime of his death.\n    Three larger clusters were intensively investigated as of July 7. \nIn one, illnesses were linked to consumption of an item containing \nfresh tomatoes and fresh jalapeno peppers. In the other two, illnesses \nwere linked to an item containing fresh jalapeno peppers and no other \nof the suspect items. Since then, detailed investigations of three \nother clusters indicate that jalapeno peppers do not explain all \nillnesses. In two of these more recent investigations, illnesses were \nlinked to an item containing fresh serrano peppers and tomatoes, but \nnot jalapeno peppers. In a third, illnesses were linked to an item that \ncontained fresh jalapenos and tomatoes. Other clusters are under active \ninvestigation. At present, the information indicates that jalapeno \npeppers and serrano peppers grown, harvested, or packed in Mexico are \nthe cause of some clusters and could be a major food vehicle for the \noutbreak. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is advising consumers \nthat jalapeno and serrano peppers grown in the United States are not \nconnected with the current Salmonella Saintpaul outbreak and consumers \nmay feel free to eat them without concern of illness. By themselves, \ntomatoes cannot explain the entire outbreak, nor do jalapeno peppers \nexplain all the clusters. The outbreak appears to be ongoing, but with \nfewer new illnesses each day. New, very active field investigations by \nCDC in collaboration with state and local health departments, and FDA \ntracebacks on jalapeno peppers and tomatoes are providing new \ninformation almost daily. It appears likely that more than one food \nvehicle is involved. Although rare, more than one food has been \nimplicated in foodborne outbreaks in the past, as observed in a group \nof 1998 outbreaks traced to imported parsley and cilantro from a single \nfarm.\nConclusion\n    The current outbreak investigation of Salmonella Saintpaul is the \nlargest foodborne outbreak in the United States in the past decade. The \ninvestigation has been especially complex, difficult, and prolonged. \nThe outbreak appears to be slowing, but we are not able to say with \nconfidence that the outbreak is over because of the reporting delay. \nThe event illustrates how a large and widespread outbreak can occur, \nappearing first as individual cases, then as small clusters, and \nfinally with large numbers of persons becoming ill if a widely consumed \nfood is contaminated. It also illustrates the importance of existing \npublic health networks: the laboratories performing PulseNet \nfingerprinting; the epidemiologists conducting the investigation; the \nenvironmental health aspects of the outbreak; the multi-disciplinary \napproach to the investigation; and the close communication and \ncollaboration among local, state, and Federal officials.\n    CDC is prepared to continue working with regulatory authorities, \nstate and local partners, food and environmental microbiologist \nscientists, and the food industry to find long-term solutions to this \nchallenging problem.\n    Thank you again for the invitation to testify before you today. I \nwill be happy to answer any questions you may have."

Thank you.\n    The Chairman. Dr. Acheson, I would like to begin my \nquestioning with you. Do your agencies measure the Salmonella \ncontamination of tomatoes or any product on a regular basis to \ndetermine what the incidence rate, the background incidence \nrate of contamination is?\n    Dr. Acheson. The FDA does what we call assignments in which \nwe will, over a period of time, sample certain types of produce \nand other foods to develop data and information, particularly \nif it is foods that we have had concern about. We do not have \nan ongoing approach or process for gathering baseline data for \ndifferent types of food items or fresh produce so it is \ntargeted, depending on areas where we have seen problems in the \npast typically.\n    The Chairman. So say we have now called out tomatoes, as we \nhave, and it was an erroneous callout, we believe, or was it an \nerroneous callout by your agency?\n    Dr. Acheson. No. I think that is a very important point. As \nDr. King pointed out, there was a very clear, methodical, \nscientific process by which CDC and the states reached a \nconclusion statistically that it was tomatoes at which point--\n--\n    The Chairman. Let me stop you for just a second, if I \nmight. You reached a statistical conclusion but you never found \nany direct evidence, you have never found a contaminated \ntomato. Is that correct?\n    Dr. Acheson. FDA has not found a contaminated tomato but we \nhave now, as you have heard, found contaminated jalapeno and \nserrano peppers, so that is two food commodities, and we have \nalso found places where serrano, jalapeno peppers and tomatoes \nhave all passed through, distribution centers where they have \nall----\n    The Chairman. They have common distribution points?\n    Dr. Acheson. Yes, common distribution points, and we have \nalso identified a farm where all three are grown. So the \npossibility certainly exists that this was on more than one \ncommodity. We now know it is on two, so it could very readily \nhave been on three.\n    The Chairman. Well, I guess my point is, in future \ntestimony that we are going to hear today, we are going to hear \nabout risk-based inspection. Certainly certain commodities are \ngoing to be at higher risk for certain pathogens than others. \nWouldn't it be good to sample and to know if we are having \nhigher incidence from different areas? Wouldn't that be a good \nidea to do if we could?\n    Dr. Acheson. Our whole approach of inspections and sampling \nand testing is based on risk. That is the whole philosophy. \nThat is the philosophy of the intervention part of the Food \nProtection Plan, and likewise, where do you put your \npreventative strategies based on risk. I mean, that is just \nlogical, common sense, good food safety practices, in our \nopinion. I suspect what you are wondering is, should we be \ndoing some routine baseline sampling? If that is what you are \nasking me of certain types of higher risk produce, and it is \ncertainly something that we have discussed internally, but it \nis very resource-intensive. Certainly as new resources are \ncoming online in 2008, 2009, I think that is something that we \nwould seriously look at being able to do. But to do that on an \nongoing basis, to make it meaningful, it is resource-intensive.\n    The Chairman. I understand that, Dr. Acheson, but I think \nthat is one of the things that we are going to delve into more \nand more as the hearing goes on today. Just this one outbreak, \nit is reported in testimony that I read that is going to be \ngiven here later in the afternoon, just this outbreak has \ncaused the tomato industry over $300 million in losses. It \ncaused 1,300 people to be off their job for an extended period \nof time. Two or three have lost their lives. That deserves a \nsignificant amount of the government's resources.\n    And so my question, I guess, is, is it not beneficial to \nsample the products that we grow, find out regions, for \nexample? You know, we import an awful lot of our food from \nother places these days. It is important to note there are \ncertain regions of Mexico that produce more outbreaks than \nothers. We have to start getting a handle on this, I would \nsuspect. So I invite your comment.\n    Dr. Acheson. Well, thank you. I couldn't agree more that \nwhen you look at the societal cost of an outbreak like this, \nwhich is really what you are discussing in terms of the \neconomic impact on the industry, and more importantly, the \neconomic impacts on human health and life sometimes in an \noutbreak. Then when you ask those sorts of questions, clearly \nFDA would wholeheartedly agree with you that that is an \nimportant priority. Within the resources that we currently \nhave, we are not able to do the level of baseline testing that \nyou are suggesting. It is not that I am saying it is not a good \nidea, it just simply isn't possible with the resources that we \ncurrently have available to set up the type of risk-based \nbaseline testing of foods, both domestic and imported from \nareas of concern or foods of concern based on public health \nrisk. It makes all kinds of sense to do that.\n    The Chairman. And so you agree that if the resources are \navailable, it would make sense to conduct some food-based risk \nassessment throughout the food supply?\n    Dr. Acheson. Absolutely, and that is one of the things that \nwe are targeting to do in the Food Protection Plan from a risk-\nbased approach.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Mahoney."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","costa","Mr. Costa","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Dr. Acheson, Dr. King, thank you very much for being here \ntoday. Let me start out by thanking Dr. Acheson for the time \nthat you spent with me updating me on this complex situation. \nIt was very illuminating. I think that what has happened is \nthat with the focus on national security and food security, I \nthink people are now starting to see that they are very related \nto one another, and so I think the nation is very concerned. I \nalso think the nation is very concerned about the fact that we \nneed to protect our food, make sure that the product that is \nbeing put on our family's table is safe, and part of that is, \nhow do we keep track of all this. But with the exciting news \nthat you just gave us, the breaking news, I didn't see it on \nCNN but I am sure it is going to be soon, my first question is, \nare we at a point now where FDA feels they can clear tomatoes \nand take the overhang, the cloud off of tomatoes? Because as \nyou know, we haven't found tomatoes to be a problem, but at the \nsame time, you haven't exonerated tomatoes. And as a result, \nthere continues to be economic damage because there has not \nbeen a clear statement on the part of the FDA that it is safe \nto eat tomatoes again.\n    Dr. Acheson. What FDA has clearly stated, I hope, and if \nnot, I will state it again, is that tomatoes that are currently \nbeing grown anywhere in the world, there is no evidence that \nthey are linked to the outbreak, whether they are Mexican \ntomatoes or domestically grown tomatoes."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    And so with this information, you are not \nprepared to say that tomatoes weren't part of the problem?\n    Dr. Acheson. Not at all. No, I think that we did not find a \npositive in tomato, as we have already heard, we have already \ndiscussed, but there are plausible explanations of how the \nSalmonella Saintpaul strain could have cross-contaminated both \ntomatoes and peppers. As I said just a moment ago, we found at \nleast one farm that is growing serrano peppers, jalapeno \npeppers and tomatoes, and we know there are other distribution \ncenters that they are going through."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Okay. Well, I think you understand that there \nis a big difference between making a very clear statement as \nopposed to saying it is okay to eat tomatoes today. Because I \nthink informed consumers are going to say, ``Well, it is only \nsafe to eat tomatoes today because we are not seeing the \nincidents and the problem could still exist out there.''\n    Anyway, next question I have for you, the source of the \npositive sample, what kind of standards do these growers have \ndown in Mexico? I mean, what food safety requirements do they \nhave?\n    Dr. Acheson. They, in order to import foods into the United \nStates, should be practicing good agricultural practices. That \nis not a requirement, as I am sure you are aware; it is a \nguidance. But it is the standard that we hold farmers, growers, \nand packers to. If, when we inspect, we find that they are not \ndoing that or we find other evidence of problems, then we would \nresort to putting them on an import alert."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    When is the last time you inspected this farm?\n    Dr. Acheson. I don't believe we have ever inspected this \nfarm."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Is there a requirement for anybody to inspect, \nthe Mexican Government, any other agency within the U.S. \nGovernment should be inspecting this farm?\n    Dr. Acheson. There is not a requirement that I am aware of \nlegally for us to inspect those farms. They essentially have an \nobligation to produce safe food, and when they don't and we \nfind out about it, then the consequences are significant."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Now, when it got to the packing facility in \nNuevo Leon and then got packaged and went to McAllen, Texas, \nwas there any testing or is there any requirement to do any \ntesting when that food came into the United States?\n    Dr. Acheson. On a routine basis, no."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Okay. Are there any standards that people \noperating in McAllen, Texas, the agricultural firm, has to meet \nwhen they take that product in?\n    Dr. Acheson. Well, they need to be operating under whatever \ngood manufacturing practices or good agricultural practices, \ndepending where you are on the distribution chain of \nagriculture versus manufacturing process and packing. So yes, \nthere are standards that they should be following."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Well, it is very clear to me, talking to my \ngrowers, that one of the problems we have here is that the U.S. \ngrowers have very exacting requirements, they have state \nofficials coming, checking out to make sure that they are in \ncompliance. But, people that are competing with them down in \nMexico are basically in this particular case, Mexico or \nanyplace overseas, they are basically operating without any \noversight and they are shipping the same product competitively \ninto the United States. Am I correct to say that the only time \nwe get concerned about it is when we have a situation like this \nand it goes back to a foreign source?\n    Dr. Acheson. Not at all, no. Last November, FDA put out a \nseries of legislative proposals, one of which is the \nrequirement for preventative controls for high-risk foods. \nFresh produce and, I have said before, tomatoes, leafy greens, \nwould fall under that very clearly because a high-risk food to \nus is one that is repeatedly associated with serious illness."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    And let me ask one last question. The costs \nassociated with the investigation in Mexico and our work down \nthere, who is paying for that?\n    Dr. Acheson. For our investigators? We are."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    So there is no requirement on the part of the \nMexican Government or no interest on the part of the people \nthat are selling it in this country to help defray the cost of \nthis?\n    Dr. Acheson. All I can tell you is that the people down in \nMexico, the FDA investigators are under----"
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    They are coming to work for you.\n    Dr. Acheson. Yes, absolutely."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    And how many staff do you have in Mexico?\n    Dr. Acheson. Currently, I think there are three there. We \nhad a team of--it generally is a team of three or four each \ntime we have a visit but it varies."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    And what are they doing down there? Are they \nchecking farms, or what is their purpose?\n    Dr. Acheson. This is now their third visit. They \nessentially will go down there based on the traceback that we \ngot----"
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    They are not headquartered there, they are not \nlocated there?\n    Dr. Acheson. No, not at all."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    I understand. Thank you.\n    The Chairman. Thank you. I anticipate that we will have a \nsecond round of questions for this panel, so you will have an \nopportunity for more questions.\n    Mr. Neugebauer, I would like to give the floor to you."
"neugebauer","Mr. Neugebauer","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    One of the things that we are talking about traceback in \nthis hearing, but traceback is an event that occurs after we \nhave a problem. One of the things that I think we have to look \nat here as we address this issue is, what resources need to be \nallocated for the prevention piece as well as building the \ninfrastructure for the traceback piece. Because if you are \nfocusing all of your resources on the traceback, you are really \nnot doing anything for food safety. I think that is one of the \nthings we need to stress to people that are watching this \nhearing, traceback doesn't necessarily make the food safer \nbecause traceback is about looking for the problem once it \nhappens. Obviously traceback does help us mitigate future \nproblems hopefully. In your estimation, what is the appropriate \nallocation of resources? At the same time that we are \ndiscussing this traceback, should we also be talking about the \nstructure of the testing and supervision and the measures that \nwe have in place to try to catch these problems before they \nhappen; but more importantly what are the things we can do to \nmitigate them in the future?\n    Dr. Acheson. You made excellent points, and we recognized \nsome time ago the importance of prevention, which I think is \nessentially what you are suggesting. You are far better at \npreventing the problem in the first place then reacting to it \nwhen it happens, and that just makes all kind of sense. To that \nend, in November, we published a Food Protection Plan that \nemphasizes prevention, intervention and response, the \nimportance of building in preventative controls up front, \nunderstanding where the risks are, making sure that industry \nunderstands what its responsibilities are, what sort of \nmitigation strategies can be put in place, where those risks \nexist. We requested new legislative authority to require \npreventative controls for high-risk foods, to require \npreventative controls for certain types of foods that were \nparticularly vulnerable to deliberate attack, and there were \neight other legislative proposals that are in there, not all \nfocused on prevention but certainly three of them are. Combined \nwith that, you are absolutely correct, the focus in past has \nbeen heavily on reaction, of essentially reacting when \nsomething bad happens. We have to get better at that. It is not \nlike we can ignore that. But there has been a deliberate shift \nof focus with the new assigned food safety money for FDA in \n2008 and what is in the President's budget for 2009 towards \nprevention, and it is all about understanding how you build in \nthose preventative controls.\n    To that end, with tomatoes, we began last year something \ncalled the Tomato Safety Initiative that we work with the State \nof Florida and the Commonwealth of Virginia. It is still \nongoing. But we have learned things from that about growing \npractices about potential problems, many of which have been \npicked up by the industry, addressed and fixed. But there are \nlessons learned in there for all of us because it is not just \nFlorida and Virginia that are growing tomatoes. We have talked \nabout tomatoes being grown in other countries. What we learn \nfrom our domestic situation could easily be applied, and it is \nall down to prevention. So the goal is for much more effort, \nenergy and resources to be put into prevention, it has to be \ncombined with a risk-based inspection and sampling process, a \nsystem for early detection of problems and then a rapid and \neffective response system when something does fall through the \ncracks."
"neugebauer","Mr. Neugebauer","neugebauer","Mr. Neugebauer","    Dr. King, do you have a reflection on that?\n    Dr. King. I would certainly agree with that, and it is \nabout the farm to the table, that public health emphasis needs \nto be across that whole spectrum. You did talk about resources \nand I think it is very important the states are well resourced. \nI think in some instances, their public health systems are not \nas well resourced as they should be and that adds to the \ndifficulties that they have."
"neugebauer","Mr. Neugebauer","neugebauer","Mr. Neugebauer","    One quick question: When we have these \noccurrences and we are beginning that traceback period, what is \nthe appropriate amount of information that we can give to \nconsumers? Not to cause this panic that we saw where just \nbasically unilaterally taking tomatoes completely out of play \nwhen we, A, didn't know whether it was tomatoes, and B, we \ndidn't know where they were coming from. What do we need to do \nbetter about that so that we can address the issue but not \ncause this fairly substantial monetary loss for the industry, \nplus the lingering effects of such a wide--I think what \nprobably scared the market more than anything was that we just \ntook the product almost completely off the market, if not \nentirely. That is a pretty big statement.\n    Dr. King. Yes, sir, that is a great question. It is all \nabout balance. It is about a balance of when do you give \ninformation to the public to make good decisions. We talked \nabout 1,319 cases. We know obviously that there are many more. \nThere are thousands of cases involved here. How quickly do we \nneed to get out to the public some good information to inform \nthem so they can make good decisions about what they eat to \nprevent further illnesses or possible deaths. So that is the \nbalance that we deal with. Unfortunately, in many of these \nfoodborne outbreaks, we don't find the etiology or the exact \ncause of the infection during the outbreak. So early on when we \nwant to give warnings to consumers, that would be most helpful. \nMore often it is the rule rather than the exception that we \nwon't necessarily have a positive culture from a product. So \nwhat we want to do is then rely on good epidemiology, good \nsurveillance, good statistical analysis that would say there is \na strong association with this food and this illness and try to \nbalance that with the messaging to the public."
"neugebauer","Mr. Neugebauer","neugebauer","Mr. Neugebauer","    I see my time has expired.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Neugebauer.\n    Mr. Etheridge.\n    Mr. Etheridge. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me thank you \nfor holding this hearing and thank our witnesses for being \nhere.\n    As you probably know, North Carolina is a state that \nproduces an awful lot of produce, and one of the expanding \nmarkets we have on the East Coast of growers and our folks \nsuffered tremendous adverse effects with the tomato, really \nalmost like an embargo really. So my question, Dr. Acheson, to \nyou is, during the traceback investigation, how frequently did \nthe FDA reach out to farmers and producers, and the second part \nof that question, what kind of communication does FDA have \nbetween FDA and the industry, folks who grow it here in the \nUnited States?\n    Dr. Acheson. Yes, I understand what you are saying. One of \nthe things that we have learned from the recent outbreaks, and \nparticularly in some of the opening statements was the \nimportance of learning lessons from these situations. We \nlearned from the spinach outbreak that continuous, regular \ncommunication with industry was not only helpful to us but it \nwas helpful to them and it was important. In this outbreak, we \nhave attempted to maintain regular conference calls with \nindustry leaders. Now, obviously we can't communicate with \nevery single grower, farmer in the United States. That is \nsimply not practical.\n    Mr. Etheridge. No, I don't mean that, but that is a very \ngeneral question with not much of an answer, because I can say \nindustry, that says one thing. I would kind of be interested to \nknow whether or not you contacted the states that are primary \ngrowing states, California, Florida, Texas, North Carolina, New \nJersey, a host of other states. Did you interact with them? Did \nwe interact with those farmers?\n    Dr. Acheson. Yes.\n    Mr. Etheridge. Or did we just talk to someone who imports? \nI guess my broader question should have been more specific.\n    Dr. Acheson. Well, the interaction with the industry, per \nse, is typically with the trade associations, and that is the \nway that we have operated, and if that is not adequate, then we \nneed to learn a lesson from that. That is on the industry part. \nWith regard to the states, we hold regular calls with \ndepartments of health and we invite departments of agriculture \nto be on those calls with us so we can share the information. \nThey are not just essentially a data dump, they are an \nopportunity for Q&As, and every time we go out with these, we \nask if anybody has any questions, and it is not like somebody \ncan't pick up the phone if they think we have some really \nimportant information and we don't think FDA has it, they are \nnot asking us for it. That may be just our ignorance that they \nhave something that could really help, and I would advocate for \nthem, pick up the phone, call us rather than saying well, you \nnever asked me.\n    Mr. Etheridge. Who would they call? Do you have an \nombudsman where you can call? Is there a number that they are \ngiven or just call FDA?\n    Dr. Acheson. There are many numbers. I mean, almost anybody \nin the agency who----\n    Mr. Etheridge. I hate to interrupt you, but that is sort of \nmy point. If there is not an entrance point where you could \ncall, it would be helpful for folks to know that because they \nmay have good information that would help.\n    Dr. Acheson. There are a number of direct avenues through \nthe Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, through the \nOffice of the Commissioner. A lot of people call me directly. \nIn fact, the Commissioner of Agriculture for North Carolina \ncalled me directly and I have spoken to him a number of times. \nHe had specific concerns much along the lines that you are \nsuggesting and said, ``Okay, Dr. Acheson, what is going on, can \nyou tell me what is happening,'' and we had a good conversation \nand he had some good ideas and some suggestions for the future. \nThat is what I am talking about. He was able to find me without \nmuch trouble.\n    Mr. Etheridge. Dr. King, does the CDC have any procedure in \nplace in order to ensure that local and state agencies are \nreporting the data in the same accurate and consistent way, so \nthat all of it comes in in a form that can be used?\n    Dr. King. Yes, sir. All the states now and some of the \ncounties and the cities actually use a system called PulseNet, \nto post on the web results of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis \n(PFGE) testing. PFGE is a standardized system where you \nactually can take a sample of a bacteria that has been cultured \nfrom a person and go through a procedure, put it in gel and \nelectrify it and get the DNA patterns and then put the results \non PulseNet where all the other states can see it at one time, \nand so we have algorithms and we look at those. Last year we \nhad over 60,000 reports of cases from the states in which we \nwere able to do that, so states then are able to compare their \noutbreak samples or their cultures collectively across the \ncountry.\n    Mr. Etheridge. One follow-up, Dr. King. We talked a lot \nabout traceback. Is there any way within the data you are \ncollecting that you have an effective and consistent traceback \nacross the reporting data--where you can have an effective \ntraceback procedure?\n    Dr. King. Sir, that is really not in our purview. The CDC \nis working in surveillance, it is working in outbreak \ninvestigation, laboratory and analysis. A lot of what we do is \nthe epidemiology, obviously we share with FDA now on a daily \nbasis. That really helps inform them in terms of helping them \nwith traceability but that's really the FDA's job.\n    Mr. Etheridge. Dr. Acheson, do you have that kind of data \ncollection across the board that is consistent enough where \nthat traceback could be effective?\n    Dr. Acheson. Yes, our traceback system is very consistent. \nI mean, it is FDA inspectors doing it, often with the \nassistance of the states. We have activated the Food Emergency \nResponse Network, which is heavily driven by the states for \nsampling, inspection. The states have done a lot of the \ninspection part of this whole outbreak investigation.\n    Mr. Etheridge. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. We are going to turn the floor over to Mr. \nCosta, but Mr. Etheridge's question just begs, isn't there wide \nvariability between the states? California and Florida do \namazing jobs. Some states, I don't want to impugn anyone's \nstate so I am not going to say which ones I think are the bad \nactors, but some states do a very poor job, don't they, Dr. \nAcheson?\n    Dr. Acheson. Well, I am not going to impugn one state over \nanother either; but, what I can tell you is, when they are \ndoing inspections for FDA, they are doing them under contract \nwith us and they are doing them to a standard----\n    The Chairman. But do you then do those inspections in those \nstates that don't have an apparatus?\n    Dr. Acheson. Yes. I mean, essentially we are using states \nto leverage resources because they are on the ground.\n    Mr. Etheridge. Mr. Chairman, I want to follow that up. How \nmany states do you have contracts with?\n    Dr. Acheson. I think it is 42.\n    Mr. Etheridge. Forty-two of the 50? Thank you.\n    The Chairman. Congressman Costa, thank you so much for \nbeing patient with us when we did additional follow-ups. The \nfloor is yours, sir."
"costa","Mr. Costa","neugebauer","Mr. Neugebauer","    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate \nyour and the Subcommittee's efforts on this very important \nissue to ensure that American consumers have the very safest \nfood possible, and I believe by and large we do. You have a \nvery difficult job as implementers of the policy because you \ndeal every day in the venue of risk assessment versus risk \nmanagement and trying to determine how we can minimize the \nrisks to the degree possible, but realizing that you cannot \nmake it entirely risk free. I mean, there are the variables on \npeople's eating habits. Certain people prepare food improperly, \nnot cooked properly. Sometimes people eat foods that are beyond \nthe ``okay on the shelf'' credibility and they are consuming \nfoods that are way beyond their shelf life. So as you wear your \nhat of risk assessment versus risk management, I have a series \nof questions and I would like to focus with regards to the Food \nand Drug Administration, and if the CDC would like to chime in, \nyou are welcome, but let us be quick because of my time.\n    I am very familiar, and of course, I have my own view on \nhow we ought to do this and improve it. It is H.R. 5904. \nCongressman Putnam testified about it earlier on and we are \nworking with a lot of different interest groups to try to see \nif we can get the sort of support to give you the additional \ntools to ensure safety. When the tomato industry, which I think \nhas a pretty sophisticated traceback system, it was my \nunderstanding that the FDA was reluctant to disclose too much \ninformation on their investigation to the industry but you \nnavigated the distribution chain blind. Do you think that \nplayed a role in prolonging the tracking process?\n    Dr. Acheson. No. First of all, we are bound by law in terms \nof what we can share with industry."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    So there is a statute that restricts the \ninformation that can be shared with industry during an \ninvestigation?\n    Dr. Acheson. Yes."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    Okay. The tomato industry has developed very \ndetailed food safety guidelines for the entire supply chain in \ncoordination with FDA. You call it, I guess, CFSAN or whatever \nthe acronym is. The frontline investigators had little or no \nknowledge about these standards and systems, I have been told, \nthat the coordination in there between CFSAN and your brain \ntrust, so to speak, and the actual investigators. What sort of \ntraining do you give your investigators?\n    Dr. Acheson. In terms of their investigational capacity, \nthey get extensive training. In terms of investigating a \nproblem and what they are going to do out in the field, they \nget a lot of training."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    Do you think it would make sense to have some \nadditional training and oversight done by CFSAN to ensure that \nthe investigators are informed before they do a search?\n    Dr. Acheson. The Center for Food Safety and Applied \nNutrition, which is CFSAN, is involved in the training of \ninvestigators and they work with the----"
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    I understand it is not to the degree that it \nshould be.\n    Dr. Acheson. Certainly if you are raising a point that \ncould training be more extensive, it is certainly something \nthat we could look at."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    In the recent traceback drill that you guys \nperformed in California or that was performed, it is my \nunderstanding that they went from Jack in the Box to a farm to \nbe able to trace in 35 minutes where tomatoes had come from. \nFive other drills they ran, the longest traceback took 5 hours. \nWhy do you think it took you folks so long to do your own FDA \ntraceback?\n    Dr. Acheson. One of the interesting things about this \noutbreak was that to start with, there were many sporadic \ncases. They weren't clusters so there was no clear focus for \ntraceback. Then what we were learning is that in fact it was \nnot the major chains and the major industries, it was small \nMexican-style restaurants very often."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    Of all your tracebacks nationwide that you \nattempted, how many were unsuccessful in each step of the \nsupply chain? Do you have that number? If you don't, could you \nprovide the Subcommittee with that information?\n    Dr. Acheson. Certainly, I will. A number of the sporadic \nones that we were doing initially for tomatoes were \nunsuccessful."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    As you went through this chart earlier, there \nwas a contamination in jalapenos and then serrano peppers on \nJuly 1. Why did it take until July 17 to remove the warning \nfrom tomatoes, even though you thought the samples from the \njalapeno were a genetic match? It doesn't exonerate other \nfoods.\n    Dr. Acheson. Tomatoes were never exonerated from that \nperspective."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    So then it is proven guilty? You are guilty \nuntil proven innocent?\n    Dr. Acheson. There isn't a question of guilt or innocence \nhere. We were operating----"
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    When the bottom drops out of the market, it is a \nreal problem.\n    Dr. Acheson. Our mandate is to protect public health, sir."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    I believe that.\n    Dr. Acheson. And we were responding to solid, scientific, \nepidemiological data through a tried and trusted source from \nprofessionals whose job it is to do that, and FDA was taking \nthat data, initiating the tracebacks. No question that they \nwere complex, that they were difficult, largely because it \nwasn't the big chains, it was many small people who are not big \nproducers, not big suppliers. You have to go to every single \none of them, you have to get the records. They are often not \nmaintained electronically. You just simply cannot do the whole \nthing in 5 hours when you are dealing with that kind of level."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    Well, but the industry was able in the case of \nthe tomato industry in California, they were able to traceback \nover five drills. The longest took 5 hours.\n    Dr. Acheson. I don't question that certain sections of the \ntomato industry are capable of doing that, but I do question \nwhether all sectors of the tomato industry from the largest to \nthe smallest are capable of doing that. What I am trying to say \nhere is that some of the smaller players were some of the ones \nthat we were dealing with here. It was not necessarily the big \nguys, who can do it all in 5 hours."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    My time has expired, Mr. Chairman. I will save \nthe questions for the next round.\n    The Chairman. I have a housekeeping piece of business that \nI have been told by counsel I have to do. I have to ask \nunanimous consent of the Committee assembled that you be \nallowed to ask questions since you are a Member of the full \nCommittee but not a Member of the Subcommittee, so without \nobjection, Mr. Costa will be allowed to ask questions at this \nhearing."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    Can I ask my questions now?\n    The Chairman. And, Mr. Costa, your time has expired."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. You are welcome. Thank you for the excellent \nline of questions.\n    Dr. Acheson, I want to follow up. I spent 6 years in the \nlegislature, three of which were as Chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee there, and I spent the entire 6 years on that \nAgriculture Committee in the legislature and now my 6 years \nhere in Congress. In that period of time, I have asked a number \nof questions about imports from other countries and how we can \nin fact determine that they are safe for our public. Why do \nother countries not have to abide by the same protocols that \nour farmers here in the United States have to comply with? Many \ntimes during those hearings, I have been told that there is \nsampling done at the border. Today you have indicated to me \nthat there is no sampling done at the border.\n    Dr. Acheson. No, that is not what I said.\n    The Chairman. Okay. Would you like to elaborate on that, \nplease?\n    Dr. Acheson. Please. I didn't say there was no sampling \ndone at the border. If I said that, it was a misrepresentation. \nThere is limited sampling based on risk, based on those food \ncommodities where we have seen previous problems.\n    The Chairman. Do you do sampling for pesticides?\n    Dr. Acheson. Yes.\n    The Chairman. How much of the product that goes through the \nborder would you estimate is sampled on a percentage basis?\n    Dr. Acheson. A hundred percent of what is coming through \nthe border is examined electronically in terms of where it has \ncome from, whether we have concerns. About one percent of that \nis physically examined by an inspector and about, I think about \nhalf of that, a sample may be taken or maybe a little less in \nterms of actually taking a sample to do some testing.\n    The Chairman. And of that \\1/2\\ of 1 percent that actually \nget sampled, what things do you sample for, and would you \nsample for everything that is known? I mean, would you be \nsampling for E. coli, for pesticides, for DDT, for things that \nare banned here in the United States?\n    Dr. Acheson. It is very much driven by the commodities and \nthe risk. There are certain types of foods where we know \npesticides have been a problem so they get sampled for that. A \ncase in point, we know we have had problems with inappropriate \nuse of antibiotics and other antimicrobials in shellfish and \nother kinds of seafood, so for those, we would sample for that \ntypically. We have ongoing assignments sampling cantaloupe for \nSalmonella because we have repeatedly seen problems with that. \nSo we don't look for everything in everything. It is targeted \nand it is risk-based.\n    The Chairman. Sir, can you tell me, you said this is the \nworst outbreak this decade. How long has your agency been \nmonitoring food safety in the United States? Let us start with \nthat first.\n    Dr. Acheson. Just a little over 100 years.\n    The Chairman. Okay. So you have been doing this a while.\n    Dr. Acheson. I haven't been doing it the whole 100 years.\n    The Chairman. So in your experience, say, in the last 20 \nyears, we have encountered a number of food safety crises and \noutbreaks in this country. You are saying this is the worst one \nin the last decade. Can you tell me, of the foodborne outbreaks \nthat we have seen with different pathogens, whether they be \npesticide-related--I think Alar was a pesticide that we had a \nproblem with a few years ago. We have had several Salmonella \ncases. We have had several E. coli cases, and your agency \ndoesn't do meat but that has been one of the areas of problems, \nso both you and USDA and have had challenges with regard to the \nareas of jurisdiction. Can you tell me how many, on a \npercentage basis, would you suspect come from Mexico or other \ncountries versus domestically grown products?\n    Dr. Acheson. In terms of outbreaks?\n    The Chairman. In terms of outbreaks.\n    Dr. Acheson. Yes. That is a question that I would ask Dr. \nKing to help me answer because the CDC tracks outbreaks more \nthan FDA. But my experience is that I am aware of maybe two or \nthree that have come from south Central America. We had \nhepatitis A on green onions. We have had Cyclospora on \nraspberries. That was not from Mexico, that was from another \ncountry. Not that many.\n    The Chairman. We had strawberries, that I remember.\n    Dr. Acheson. Well, it was originally thought to be \nstrawberries and then it turned out to be raspberries.\n    The Chairman. But that wasn't from Mexico?\n    Dr. Acheson. No, Guatemala.\n    The Chairman. Okay. Dr. King, can you elaborate on that \nquestion?\n    Dr. King. We don't have too much information \ninternationally. What we are trying to do is have \nstandardization in some of the sampling internationally. We \nhave this PulseNet system that I have talked to you about that \nis now becoming more global. China is looking to put it in. \nMexico has it. We also have a system called Global Salm-Surv, \nwhich is also looking internationally so that we can see these \nproducts. It would be good to know, are they having outbreaks \nin other cities, in other parts of the world, and can we \nactually compare those outbreak strains with what we are seeing \nin the United States. A multi-state outbreak may be a multi-\ncountry outbreak. We are not there yet but that is something we \nare looking at down the road.\n    The Chairman. Dr. King, what was the substance of the \ncommunications that CDC had with local officials conducting the \ninvestigations?\n    Dr. King. Early on, New Mexico was the first source. That \nwas May 22 when they actually contacted us about 19 potential \ncases with the same PulseNet identification. From that point \non, we talked to them frequently. Texas was involved. The \nIndian Health Service was involved. We helped them design----\n    The Chairman. We are running over my time so let me further \ndefine my question that might bore into exactly what I am \ntrying to get to. PulseNet has without question improved the \nability of scientists to identify foodborne illnesses and \noutbreaks, no question about it. Scientists today can identify \noutbreaks that never would have been identified a decade ago, \nand people who thought they were just having the stomach flu, \nwe now know have been sick or whatever it is. However, it seems \nto me that for PulseNet to work efficiently, a state should \ninput such information immediately rather than wait until they \nthink they have a cluster. I think we can all agree here today \nthat 2 months delay is quite a significant period of time. An \nawful lot of folks can get ill, as we have seen, in that 2 \nmonth period of time. How is it supposed to work with PulseNet, \nand during your daily calls with these public officials, did \nany states question the hypothesis that tomatoes were the \nvehicle for the outbreak, or can you provide data implicating \nany other food product, and if so, when?\n    Dr. King. We have conversations with the states almost on a \ndaily basis. Certainly the 43 states were involved. We \nconstantly have communications with them through conference \ncalls. We have an ``OutbreakNet'' system where we talk to \nepidemiologists across the country, where we compare notes, we \ntalk about hypotheses, we question each other, I think which is \nhealthy, in a rigorous way. Part of what the states need to do \nin these case control studies where they are actually talking \nto cases and match controls, that information needs to come \nforward. Many states do that themselves. Over 90 percent of \nthese outbreaks that we see are all done by the states \nthemselves. We only are involved in a small percentage of \nthose. We are able to help them where we can. We are able to \nsend people in in large outbreaks like this where we had so \nmany clusters. There is variability in terms of the reporting \nfrom the states. That is one of the areas that we would like to \nbe able to cut down on. How quickly states will put results up \non PulseNet, how quickly you get specimens from clinical \nlaboratories, how quickly they are able to handle them, doing \nserotyping, do they save them and do them in lumps or do they \ndo them right away.\n    The Chairman. Well, I think that is part of the question we \nare trying to bore in on, Dr. King, because in earlier \ntestimony, I can't recall if it was you or Dr. Acheson who \nindicated to us that there was standardization amongst the \nstates. But now you are indicating that some states report very \nquickly and some states don't, that there is not in actuality \nuniformity in the protocols that the states comply with.\n    Dr. King. Yes, sir, there is standardization in terms of \nthe process of using PulseNet. Some states are able to report \nit more quickly. Some delay in that. Some of them will not run \nthe samples quickly, they will do it in a bulk way.\n    The Chairman. That is exactly my point, sir.\n    Dr. King. But the procedure is the same in terms of \nPulseNet. The amount of time that it takes them to do it is the \nvariability.\n    The Chairman. Well, that is my point, is that in California \nor Florida, you might get that overnight. In another state, \nTexas or Minnesota, it may take--and I don't know. I am not an \nexpert so I am not saying which ones and I certainly don't want \nto offend a state, but since they are not here to represent \nthemselves, we will use them as an example. They might take a \nlonger period of time in which case people continue to get sick \nand we really don't have the information that we need.\n    Dr. King. And I agree with you, and we talk to states and \nask them if they can decrease this amount of time. It is very \nimportant. We can't stay 2 and 3 weeks behind in order to do \nthese outbreak investigations. I agree with you that we are \npushing states to try to do that in as rapid a way as possible.\n    The Chairman. Well, not only are we not being fair with the \npublic, who is becoming ill when there is an outbreak that \nshould have been reported but wasn't. We are not being fair to \nthe farmers for 3 weeks who are losing their potential to \nprovide their products to the market, but are being implicated \nin something where they are absolutely innocent possibly.\n    Dr. King. I agree with that, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Mr. Mahoney."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","costa","Mr. Costa","    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    Just a follow-up question to both of you. Has there been \nany indication, have you found anything in your investigation \nthat would indicate that any tomato grower in the United States \nhad done anything that would warrant at this stage of the game \nthat there was any problem with what they had done as far as \ngrowing tomatoes, packing tomatoes and delivering tomatoes? \nHave you found anything?\n    Dr. Acheson. No."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    So you haven't found any indication?\n    Dr. Acheson. No. As part of the process, we went down and \nwe inspected the farms in Florida. By the time we got there, \nthey were no longer in production, but we did not find \nanything----"
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    That there is a problem with contaminated \nwater supply or something like, I mean.\n    Dr. Acheson. We didn't find any problems. That is all I can \nsay. But they were not in production."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    I mean, you understand that crop insurance \ndoesn't cover this loss. I mean, the estimate in my State of \nFlorida is about a $47 million direct loss to the growers. I \nthink $300 million is probably light in terms of what the total \nimpact is, but again, the biggest casualty here is consumer \nconfidence in our tomato industry. It appears from this \ntestimony I have heard today that what we have is a situation \nwhere we have a two-tiered system. We have foreign growers that \noperate under a completely different set of standards and \noversight than our domestic producers. I won't spend any time \ntalking about the inequality of that as far as cost and \ncompetitiveness but certainly for public health, there has got \nto be a lot of concern, which gets to my last question.\n    I think that it is clear that given the resources that you \nhave available to both of you at this point in time in your \nrespective organizations, I am confident that you did the very \nbest you could possibly do. But, I also am hearing that there \nis potentially more that we could be doing. So my question is, \nin a perfect world, given the expertise that you have, do we \nneed to take action? Is there more that we could be doing; \nshould we be doing more; do we need to give you more resources? \nI mean, from your experience, Dr. Acheson and Dr. King, what \nwould you recommend to this Committee that we do to fix this \nproblem?\n    Dr. Acheson. There is unquestionably more that we need to \ndo. I think your point about the economic impact needs to be \naddressed. The urgency of public health needs to be addressed. \nThe Food Protection Plan has a lot of suggested authorities \nthat we think we need and we don't have those. It is going to \nrequire resources and clearly that is being addressed and it is \ngoing to be ongoing. But it is not all about response. If you \nare thinking about response from FDA's perspective, then \nclearly examining ways to improve traceback, make it faster and \nnot just with the big producers but with everybody. It has to \nbe uniform. You talked about standards for domestic versus \nimported. The requirement for preventative controls would go \nsome way toward that, and you know, frankly, we need to hold \neverybody to the same standard whether they are domestic or a \nforeign grower."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    And do you have the resources necessary within \nthe FDA to do that, to implement that and to do that today?\n    Dr. Acheson. No, we don't. The new resources that we have \ngotten will go a long way to begin to develop those once we \nhave the authorities. But, to actually implement them and \nassure that they are being maintained, whether it be through \ndirect FDA inspection or third-party inspection with FDA audit \nand oversight, that is not part of the current----"
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Do you feel that the FDA has the expertise and \nthe ability to implement such a system and to operate it \nsuccessfully?\n    Dr. Acheson. Yes, I do. I believe FDA has the knowledge, \nhas the system, but we need to do more. We need to hire more \nexperts, particularly in certain specific areas, produce being \none of them. We do have some produce experts. We need to hire \nmore."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Dr. King, do you have any thoughts in terms of \nthe CDC?\n    Dr. King. Yes, thanks. One of the things I wanted to \nreiterate in terms of resources would be for the states. One of \nthe reasons that they were slow is not because they are \nincompetent, it is because they went really flat out, and when \nyou have a lot of cases and all that work to do, they just \ncouldn't keep up. So there are resource issues within the \nstates. There is no question about that. I think this idea of \nwhat we call infectious disease ecology, understanding how \nagriculture and public health need to be linked over a \ncontinuum and how the outcome is very positive that we both try \nto achieve. We don't want to just look at cases in controls. We \nwant to be able to move upstream and we need industry support \nto do that. We need their help. We need their understanding. \nAnd I think one of the lessons learned for us that would come \nout of this would be to have that kind of expertise as part of \nputting this whole integrated strategy together and we would \nlook very much forward to doing that.\n    As far as CDC goes, we would like a better electronic \nsystem where we could actually have data from the states that \nwould come in, do it quickly, for data from case control \nstudies to come in, where the analysis could be done more \nquickly, could be done on a Web-based system. We would look at \nthat and potential iterations of PulseNet which would look at \nmicroarrays, Luminex kind of platforms where it is more \naccurate and quicker. That technology is available and we would \nlook forward to adopting that down the road."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Thank you, Dr. King.\n    The Chairman. We are going to have to move on. Thank you, \nMr. Mahoney.\n    Mr. Costa, if you have a couple burning questions since you \nhave been so patient sitting here, I would like to give it to \nyou. We have two witnesses that have flights to catch and so we \nare short on time, and I also have to get two or three things \non the record for the staff. So I will turn it over to Mr. \nCosta and ask for brevity."
"costa","Mr. Costa","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    I will try to be quick. Does the FDA currently \nhave the authority to institute mandatory regulations for high-\nrisk products or do you believe that Congress needs to give you \nthat authority?\n    Dr. Acheson. Do you mean mandate preventative controls? We \ndo not have authority to do that."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    Okay. Because it seems to me, the problem where \nyou have very sophisticated industries like the tomato industry \nin California or Florida is really--and you have the \ntraceability technology in place, that what we are really \ntalking about is the small truck farmer that maybe delivers to \na restaurant. Unless you have a receipt or some traceability, \nyou have no ability to--I mean, the larger producer that goes \nthrough a wholesaler, goes through a co-op, a processing plant, \ntraceability there is pretty good, would you not agree?\n    Dr. Acheson. Yes, but you need to hold everybody to the \nsame standard. I think that is what you are suggesting."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    And you believe we ought to do that?\n    Dr. Acheson. Right, for preventative controls, absolutely."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    There are other questions, but for the sake of \ntime, I will defer and thank you again, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Congressman Costa, maybe we could submit them \nin writing and get a response."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    Yes, I will do that.\n    The Chairman. Thank you very much.\n    Dr. Acheson, We need to clarify, because we think there is \nconfusion in the testimony, whether or not you have found \ntomatoes on the farms where the peppers have been implicated, \nwhether they actually grow those on those same farms as the \npeppers that have been implicated.\n    Dr. Acheson. Okay. If we could go back to the diagram, I \nwill try and explain it. The red box that is furthest away from \nme is a farm where the pepper that we found in McAllen, Texas, \npepper samples. That is where that went back to when we traced \nit back, so the positive pepper samples went back to that farm. \nThat farm grows tomatoes and peppers. The farm that I talked \nabout today is a different farm. It is lower down on the chart. \nThat farm grows just serrano and jalapeno peppers, it does not \ngrow tomatoes. Both of those farms are going through their \ndistribution system through one distribution center that is in \nthe middle of the chart with a circle around it. So there is at \nleast one farm that is growing all three and there is at least \none distribution center that all three are passing through.\n    The Chairman. Let me bore in on that question. In the farm \nthat has grown all three, did you find positive samples at the \nfarm or at the distribution center?\n    Dr. Acheson. We found the positive sample in a jalapeno \npepper at a distribution center in Texas. We visited that farm \nand there are samples that are pending in the lab from that \nfarm.\n    The Chairman. Okay. So to date, we don't have a positive \nimplication directly to a tomato on either one of those \nproperties? There were tomatoes grown on that property. That \nproperty shipped to a distribution center and you have found \ncontamination at that distribution center?\n    Dr. Acheson. We have not found contamination at the \ndistribution center in Mexico. We found contamination at the \ndistribution center in Texas, and I think your point is that \nhave we found a positive Salmonella Saintpaul isolate on the \nfarm that is growing all three. To this point, no, but those \nsamples right now are in the lab being analyzed, so that could \nchange.\n    The Chairman. The Committee will be very interested in that \noutcome.\n    Dr. Acheson. Absolutely.\n    The Chairman. Thank you. Go ahead."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","costa","Mr. Costa","    Just to clarify, I thought you said that in \nthe box furthest away from you, that you had found \ncontamination or Salmonella in the water. Did I misunderstand \nthat?\n    Dr. Acheson. The box in the middle of the chart that has a \nhand-drawn red circle around it, that is the farm where we \nfound contamination in the irrigation water and in a sample of \nserrano peppers.\n    The Chairman. Dr. Acheson and Dr. King, I am going to have \nto fast-forward because we have other panelists who have to \ntestify and catch planes, but I am going to ask you to submit \nto some requests. Would you please provide the Committee with \nthe criteria and communications procedures used by your \nagencies to communicate risk and issue alerts? And second of \nall for Dr. Acheson, would you please provide the Committee, \nwhen did you first learn that jalapenos were being considered \nby CDC as a potential source for the outbreak? And finally, for \nDr. King, could you please submit to the Committee the criteria \nused by CDC in conducting the epidemiological and traceback \ninvestigations? Those three things, the Committee needs further \nclarification on the exact procedures. We won't take up \nCommittee time to do that today but I want to thank you both \nfor your testimony and I appreciate you being here with us \ntoday.\n    Dr. Acheson. Thank you.\n    Dr. King. Thank you very much.\n    The Chairman. Now, we are going to deviate a little bit \nagain and we are going to ask that a panelist from the fourth \npanel join panel number three. Would Dr. Michael Osterholm \nplease join panel number three? And I will call that panel up \nfor questioning now.\n    We would like Mr. Anthony J. DiMare, Vice President of \nDiMare Homestead Inc., DiMare Ruskin Inc. and DiMare Johns \nIsland, Inc., of Ruskin, Florida, to come forward; Mr. Henry \nGiclas, Vice President of Strategic Planning, Science and \nTechnology for Western Growers Association of Irvine, \nCalifornia; Mr. Bryan Silbermann, President of the Produce \nMarketing Association, Newark, Delaware; and Mr. Thomas E. \nStenzel, President and CEO of United Fresh Produce Association, \nWashington, D.C., to please come forward. I am sorry if I \nbutchered your names. I typically do that.\n    Dr. Osterholm, I know you are blazing a trail to a plane. \nWe are going to let you testify and then if you need to go, we \nwill excuse you after your testimony. If you can stay, we are \nhappy to have you.\n    Dr. Osterholm. Mr. Chairman, I can stay for another hour.\n    The Chairman. Dr. Osterholm, please go ahead and proceed \nwith your testimony and then we will go next to Mr. DiMare and \ndown the line as I read your names off today."

"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Dr. Osterholm. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Dr. \nMichael Osterholm. I am the Director of the Center for \nInfectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of \nMinnesota, and for almost 30 years I have been involved in the \narea of foodborne disease epidemiology, having served many of \nthose years as the State Epidemiologist at the Minnesota \nDepartment of Health and have led a number of complex large \nfoodborne disease outbreaks including that involving produce \nover that time.\n    Today I have submitted my written comments in detail to you \nabout the issues that we believe are relevant to this \ndiscussion you are having today. I think the discussion we have \nhad to date here this afternoon has been very helpful. With \nthat, let me make a couple of specific comments that I am sure \nthe rest of the panel will address and I think really go the \nheart of some of the issues that you have.\n    Some of you are aware that as early as the first part of \nJune, I raised questions about the conduct of the investigation \nthat was undergoing examination at that time in terms of the \nSalmonella Saintpaul. Let me make it clear that at no time was \nI challenging the issue that tomatoes might be involved but if \nwe in fact would ever find the source of those using the \ntechniques that we are. I would submit to you today and having \nbeen involved with outbreaks with multiple vehicles from over \nmultiple periods of time from the same farms that it is very \nlikely that this could represent multiple vehicles. I think \nthat statements today suggesting tomatoes are not involved are \nvery premature, and that in fact this very well could be an \noutbreak that involved multiple vehicles over multiple periods \nof time which made it much more confusing. I believe those \nanswers will be forthcoming. I believe that we will learn \nspecifically whether or not there were three, two or four \ndifferent vehicles involved and I would urge that all of us \ntake a breath in the sense of saying we need the information. \nClearly public health owes that to all of us here but that in \nfact you have to be very careful about making the conclusions \nthat it is just peppers.\n    I would add that I must, Mr. Chairman, at the risk of a \nfriendly amendment to your comments, I come from the great \nState of Minnesota. Our health department has pioneered many of \nthe techniques used today, and in fact, we have the fastest \nturnaround of any state in the country for both interviews and \npulsed-field gel electrophoresis submission, and I would \ndaresay that we are very proud of that point.\n    The Chairman. The Chairman of the Committee and all the \nrest of the delegation probably would admonish me as well, and \nI accept it.\n    Dr. Osterholm. I am sure Representative Peterson will be \nvery pleased to hear that, sir.\n    Having said that, I also want to point out to you though \nthat I think that given this cause issue, we have more to do, \nbut I don't think that this outbreak has necessarily provided \nany wrong information yet. It may have provided incomplete \ninformation but I think we are going to learn more about that.\n    The next thing I would address here, and I heard this \ncomment made multiple times today. As someone who has spent the \nbetter part of their career in the area of foodborne disease \nepidemiology, I just have to say I don't know where we come off \nor where we have the data to support that we have the safest \nfood supply in the world. I would suggest we have the world's \nfood supply, and the fact being is today if you look at any \nitem, whether it is processed or non-processed foods, your \nNutragrain bar that you think of as a domestically produced \nitem in any one day may have ingredients from ten different \ncountries in it. I could go through a whole laundry list of \nproducts. So the point being today is that we do have an \ninternational food supply. I think you have heard already here \nin this hearing that the FDA has a very limited ability to \naddress the ingredients or food products coming into this \ncountry relative to what they can do of what is processed or \ngrown within our borders. I think this is an important \nconsideration that we all need to talk about.\n    Having said that, also I think we have to talk about the \nindustry. As someone who has been very involved with foodborne \noutbreaks and has actually worked closely with the industry, I \ndon't know if it is the 95-9 rule or the 99-1 rule or the \n99.1.01 rule but I have never seen any food commodity produced \nyet for which everyone within that particular domain has a \nstellar operation. There are many organizations in this country \nthat have suffered because the least of their producers was the \none that caused the outbreak. I think one of the things we have \nto address is not just a blanket statement that the industry \nhas done this or the industry has done that. I actually \nrepresent a company that is a major supplier of bagged produce, \nlettuce and so forth, and to date, they have never had a \ndocumented foodborne outbreak in 20-some years of production. \nThey are an example of a company that has done it very well and \ndone it right. But just down the road, one of their competitors \nwas responsible for the spinach outbreak that occurred 2 years \nago. So I think we have to be very careful about this, and I \nknow our industry representatives will make that point, I am \nsure, that we have to assure that the least of us have the \nstandards that are very important.\n    The next area of comment here is, I think we have some \nconfusion going on with the difference between what we call an \nepidemiologic association and traceability. This outbreak is \nnot about traceability. It is not. This outbreak was about an \nassociation, meaning the public health agencies, the state and \nlocal health departments together with the CDC, did they do the \nappropriate investigation to determine this is the likely \nsource of this, meaning this food item as a class, as a \ncategory. Once that is established, or if it is not established \nin the minds of reasonable people you can argue it wasn't \nestablished, then that information goes to the FDA, and I have \nseen a constant discussion of the failures of the FDA in this \noutbreak investigation. I just want to point out that if this \nproduct really isn't associated with tomatoes, which again I \nthink we all have to reserve judgment on, that is a failure of \nthe up-front part of the investigation of the CDC and the state \nand local health departments. That is not an FDA issue. Our own \nMinnesota Department of Health, which was the group that found \nthe first major association with jalapeno peppers and the large \nrestaurant outbreak in the Twin Cities, and actually fingered \nthe location of where that ultimate positive came from and did \ndetermine jalapeno peppers were involved, basically did that \nentire investigation a little short of 10 days, tracing it back \nto one of three farms in Mexico in addition. So in fact, that \nis the kind of information that is very important. Once that is \nestablished, then we go to traceability. Then we say okay, if \nwe do in fact have peppers, where do they come from. My \noriginal criticism of this outbreak investigation as our group, \nthe investigations I led, actually determined that in the first \nthree outbreaks in this country due to tomatoes and all of them \nwere locally and domestically grown tomatoes, required us to \nnot only look at the tomatoes where the cases brought them but \nthe people or the controls, because tomatoes do get repackaged \nand resorted, and that has changed over time. All we were \npointing out was, you have to trace them all back to basically \nthen find out where the preponderance of tomatoes came from. \nAnd so I just want to point that out because I keep hearing \nthat this is about traceability. I have yet to see an outbreak \ninvestigation where we could not determine the source when we \nhad an association because of a lack of traceability \ncapability. Some, we have had a much harder time doing. Some, \nwe haven't had the greatest clarity, meaning it was an absolute \nperfect bull's-eye hit, but on a whole, this is not about \ntraceability, this is about can we find it in the first \ninstance and associate it.\n    The next issue is risk-based testing. We cannot test our \nway out of this problem. Testing a product to a certain degree \nisn't meaningless but almost, and the reason I say that is \nbecause testing is based on the statistical probability you are \ngoing to find it in a product. We have oftentimes implicated a \nproduct epidemiologically, meaning that the data were clear \nthat people were getting sick eating this product, people not \ngetting ill were not eating the product, and it still took us \nweeks and weeks to find it. I remember one particular example \nwhich had nothing to do with produce but some years ago, \nbecause I got really panned in the media by the dairy \nindustry----\nhave to speed it up.\n    Dr. Osterholm. I know. I am looking at my clock here. I \njust have 1 minute left.\n    The point being is that we actually implicated cheese in an \noutbreak of Salmonella infection and they couldn't find it in \nthis cheese for a period of 5 weeks and then one day a \nlaboratory in Canada happened to be testing some of the cheese \nand found it. The point being is testing doesn't necessarily \ntell you it is there or doesn't tell you it is there.\n    And the finally, the last point I just want to make, the \nreal issues around this is what happens at the state and local \nhealth departments with the CDC, and this is about disease \nsurveillance and outbreak investigation. Today less than a \nquarter of the clusters that we find through PulseNet, these \nclusters of cases, do we ever find a source of why they \noccurred. Today we have a system out there that is largely \nbroken at the state and local health department level where \nthis disease surveillance occurs. In my written testimony, we \nprovide great detail how we can fix that at a cost that would \nbe just a small percentage of any one of these large outbreaks \nfor the country. I think if I would urge you of anything today, \none of the great services you could do is help forward that \npart of the agenda. Then the gentlemen sitting to my right \nwould very rarely find themselves in this position of we have a \npossible situation but we don't know what it is, therefore, \neverybody is in limbo. What they need, what they deserve, what \nthe public deserves are quick answers with quick identification \nof what the problems are and then rectifying those problems in \nsuch a way as to have a minimal impact on both the food supply \nbut most of all meaning that there is an unsafe food in the \ndistribution center.\n    Thank you very much."

"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    The challenges of foodborne disease surveillance in the U."
break,break,break,break
"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Jurisdiction for foodborne disease surveillance in the U.S. is \nbased on individual state reporting rules. Across 50 states, more than \n3,000 local health departments act with varying degrees of autonomy. \nLast year at the Annual OutbreakNet/CSTE meeting, C.P. Kanwat from \nSouth Carolina and Bill Keene from Oregon presented the results of a \nsurvey of the states regarding the structure and practices of foodborne \ndisease surveillance programs. Results of this survey found that \ngastrointestinal disease surveillance was the responsibility of local \nagencies in approximately half of the states and was centralized in a \nsingle state office in approximately a quarter of the states. \nSurveillance was conducted by regional state offices in approximately \n20% of states. The multiplicity of different models for conducting \nfoodborne disease surveillance makes it difficult to standardize \nsurveillance activities across the country. Imagine what it would be \nlike if our U.S. Weather Service was a hybrid system of local, state \nand Federal agencies of varying resources and expertise and all using \ndifferent methods and models to predict, document and interpret our \nweather. It would be a mess; to certain degree that is the system we \nhave for foodborne disease surveillance and outbreak response.\n    CDC aggregates surveillance on a national level and provides \nconsultation and coordination for multi-state outbreak investigations. \nHowever, CDC lacks authority to independently investigate outbreaks \nwithin a state, and while encouraging states to be active participants \nin multi-state outbreaks, has limited resources to directly support \noutbreak investigations. The primary mechanism that CDC has to respond \nto outbreaks is the initiation of an EpiAid request by a state health \ndepartment. In response to an EpiAid, CDC can mobilize resources and \ndispatch an Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) officer, or small group \nof EIS officers to the state making the request. EIS officers are \nepidemiologists in training. Over the years this has been a tremendous \nresource for states investigating unusual outbreaks, outbreaks caused \nby an unknown agent or in states lacking adequate resources or basic \nexpertise to conduct such investigations. However, the logistics of \ndispatching one or a few EIS officers to a field location do not \naddress the primary need to rapidly conduct a large number of \ninterviews as part of the investigation of an outbreak of foodborne \nillness. While participating in outbreak investigations is an important \npart of EIS training, EIS officers do not always have the experience \nand skills needed to lead a complex foodborne disease outbreak \ninvestigation.\n    Because CDC has primary relationships with the states, it is also \nlimited in its ability to directly interact with the more than 3,000 \nlocal health agencies that in many states have primary responsibility \nfor conducting patient interviews. The result is that in many outbreak \ninvestigations, local agencies are left out of the loop and may not \nfully appreciate the importance of their individual efforts (or lack \nthereof) to the overall outbreak investigation. Establishing effective \nmeans of integrating local agencies into large, multi-state \ninvestigations that are detected and coordinated on a national level is \na major concern.\n    From 2002-2005, 40% of E. coli O157:H7 outbreaks and 25% of \nSalmonella outbreaks reported to CDC were multi-jurisdictional in \noccurrence. Increasingly, these outbreaks are detected by the \nidentification and investigation of clusters of cases with identical \npulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles. These profiles are \nthe fingerprint of the infectious agent that allows us to determine \ntheir similarity and serve as the key data used in PulseNet. The \ndevelopment of standardized PFGE protocols and the ability to transmit \nand store digitized PFGE patterns has put PulseNet at the forefront of \npathogen-specific surveillance for Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7 and \nListeria. No longer do states have to send living cultures to CDC for \nthe purposes of comparison. Electronic image files can be uploaded to a \ncentral server and shared with public health officials instantly, \naround the country.\n    The active participation of public health laboratories can be seen \nfrom the result of surveillance in 2005, when over 5,000 E. coli \nO157:H7 patterns and almost 30,000 Salmonella patterns were uploaded to \nPulseNet. These data and the subsequent analysis resulted in the \ndetection of 36 multi-state E. coli O157:H7 clusters and 152 multi-\nstate Salmonella clusters. The CDC was involved in 19 multi-state E. \ncoli O157:H7 investigations and 30 multi-state Salmonella \ninvestigations. However, the food items responsible for transmitting \nthe infectious agent, known as a vehicle, were identified for only four \nE. coli O157:H7 investigations (or 21%) and eight Salmonella \ninvestigations (27%) (CDC data presented at 2008 OutbreakNet/CSTE \nmeeting by Dr. David Warnock).\n    The relatively low yield of these investigations is disappointing. \nWhile some of these clusters may have represented the co-incidental \noccurrence of organisms with a similar pattern from multiple unrelated \nsources, others were almost certainly outbreaks for which the source \ncould not be identified. There are many reasons why an investigation \nmay fail to identify a common source. The first is the length of time \nbetween when patients got sick and when the outbreak was recognized. In \na study of enteric disease timelines, known as the EDITS study and led \nby Dr. Hedberg and conducted on behalf of CSTE, the average time \ninterval between onset of illness and subtyping by PFGE was 15 days for \nE. coli O157:H7 and 18 days for Salmonella. Because a cluster is \ndefined as the occurrence of multiple cases caused by strains with \nmatching PFGE patterns, clusters may not be recognized until 3-4 weeks \nafter onset of illness. If interviews of cases are not initiated until \nafter the cluster is identified, these further delays mean cases are \nbeing interviewed about exposures that may have occurred 4-6 weeks \nearlier. Longer delays reduce the likelihood that cases will accurately \nrecall important details of where and what foods they may have eaten \nbefore they became ill. Since the incubation period for E. coli O157:H7 \nand Salmonella infections may be up to a week, this represents a \nconsiderable challenge to identifying the contaminated food item.\n    A final challenge to identifying the source of contamination is \nthat many public health agencies do not use a standardized exposure \nquestionnaire or collect detailed source information about food items \nduring initial interviews. It is very common to identify from which \nrestaurants and grocery stores food was obtained and also to ask about \nconsumption of food items such as chicken, ground beef or lettuce and \ntomatoes. However, these are not always cross-referenced in a way that \nwould link a specific tomato to a meal at a specific restaurant--\ninformation that is critical to tracing the source of contamination. \nSystematically collecting detailed exposure information during early \ninterviews with cases is a critical need to improve the effectiveness \nof our surveillance and outbreak investigation efforts."

"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Opportunities for improving foodborne disease surveillance."
break,break,break,break
"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    The challenges we face in improving our foodborne disease \nsurveillance have been becoming increasingly apparent for some time. \nThe CDC, FDA and the CSTE have been working for a number of years to \ndefine the problems and seek solutions. In 2001, the National Food \nSafety System (NFSS) Project, Outbreak Coordination and Investigation \nWorkgroup published guidelines for improving coordination and \ncommunication in multi-state foodborne outbreak investigations. These \nwere specifically developed to address the challenges of coordinating \nlarge and complex foodborne outbreak investigations among multiple \nstates and Federal public health and food regulatory agencies.\n    While these guidelines targeted communication and coordination ``at \nthe top'' of the investigation, they appear to not have increased our \nability to engage local public health agencies in multi-state outbreak \ninvestigations and to rapidly develop the critical exposure information \n``at the base'' of the investigation.\n    While we fully support the effort of CIFOR, the multidisciplinary \nworking we discussed previously, we want to submit that there is a \nnatural conservatism in any large and complex system that resists the \nadoption of the types of new practices we believe may be needed to make \neffective use of the tools we now have available for foodborne disease \nsurveillance in the U.S., and to respond to the challenges posed by our \nrapidly changing food systems. The tension between holding onto the \nmethods of the past and using effective new methods of the present are \nseen in much of the discussions within CIFOR, and the development of \nguidelines for investigating outbreaks. Drafts of these guidelines are \ncurrently available for review and comment on the CIFOR website (http:/\n/www.cifor.us/documents/CIFORGuidelines-draft.pdf).\n    Chapter 4 of these guidelines on foodborne disease surveillance and \noutbreak detection contains a very thorough overview of foodborne \ndisease surveillance methods, strengths and limitations. This chapter \nalso describes model practices for routine surveillance and cluster \nevaluation--the actions that led to the early detection of outbreaks \nsuch as the recent outbreak caused by Salmonella serotype Saintpaul. \nThe reality of the current situation is that the practices used may \nvary based on pathogen priority, the needs of a particular outbreak, \nand on an agency's resources. These determinations are made on a state-\nby-state and agency-by-agency basis. However, there are a series of \npractices described that provide a more aggressive approach to \nsurveillance that we believe give us the best chance to rapidly detect \noutbreaks and identify the source of exposure. Many of these are \npractices have been successfully used by the MDH. These include \ninterviewing all laboratory-diagnosed cases when they are first \nreported using a standardized form to collect detailed exposure \ninformation when recall is the greatest, and as possible new exposures \nare suggested during case interviews linked to an outbreak, to \nsystematically re-interview initial cases to uniformly assess these \nexposures. We believe these should be adopted as best practices, and \nthat where resources limit the adoption of these practices, we must \nfind a way to build the infrastructure of our public health system to \nmake it possible.\n    Another key to the success of foodborne disease surveillance in \nMinnesota has been the use of a dedicated group of eight to ten public \nhealth students (four to five FTE's), known as ``Team Diarrhea'', to \nserve as a primary resource for interviewing cases as part of routine \nsurveillance and outbreak investigation. The use of Team D fits very \nnicely into the centralized system of foodborne disease surveillance \nthat exists in Minnesota. Moreover, since conducting interviews in a \ntimely manner is one of the rate-limiting steps in outbreak \ninvestigations, we believe a series of regional Team Ds or a national \nTeam D would go a long way to providing precisely the real-time support \nfor outbreak investigations at the state and local levels that is so \nsorely needed.\n    The benefits of Team D go far beyond providing a dedicated group of \ninterviewers. Because members of Team D are public health students at \nthe University of Minnesota, they receive valuable experience in \nconducting surveillance that enriches their academic training \nimmeasurably. The graduates of Team D are now moving into important \nfood safety roles in public health and food regulatory agencies across \nthe country.\n    We believe the time is right to build on the success of Team D in \nMinnesota and to invest in a major Masters of Public Health-level \ntraining program that should include epidemiology and surveillance \nmethods, risk assessment and risk management, and overviews of the food \nsystem from farm to fork. This training program should include service \non National Team D, to conduct interviews and support outbreak \ninvestigations at state and local levels.\n    The model for such a training program currently exists at the \nUniversity of Minnesota, School of Public Health. In addition to our \nacademic tracks in Infectious Disease and Food Safety, the University \nhas a post-graduate certificate program in Food Protection that defines \nthe key curriculum for food safety, with course offerings available \nthrough a 3 week public health institute, or online.\n    We bring this to your attention to demonstrate that we have the \ncapacity to rapidly scale up this training program and establish both a \nNational Team D to provide an immediate resource to rapidly conduct \ninterviews to support multi-state outbreak investigations, and a long-\nterm program to develop a new generation of food safety specialists \nwith applied training in outbreak investigations to work in public \nhealth and food regulatory agencies and food-producing industries.\n    To accomplish this effort quickly and with expertise, we propose \nthat the University of Minnesota can be designated as the lead academic \ninstitution to develop this new food safety training initiative and \nthat a consortium of other schools of public health be established to \nreplicate this training program under the University's leadership. \nWithin 1 year this program can be established and prepared to support \noutbreak investigations across the country. Within 5 years it will \ntransform foodborne disease surveillance at all levels.\n    A frequent objection to the ``Minnesota Model'' has been the \nadditional resources needed to interview all cases of foodborne \ndiseases with a sensitive and specific questionnaire, conduct \nlaboratory testing on a ``real time'' basis, and routinely investigate \nall clusters of disease. We don't know how much money is currently \nbeing spent on foodborne disease surveillance nationwide, but a CIFOR \ncost-benefit study is underway to answer that question. Our \nunderstanding is that most of the nation's capacity is funded by the \nCDC Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity Cooperative Agreement, which \nhas had level or declining funding for the past several years. Many \nstates do not have any dedicated foodborne disease epidemiologists, and \nsome states have only a single part time laboratory worker to conduct \nPFGE analysis. We believe that the amount of funds needed to improve \nthis situation nationwide is small compared to the consequences of \nmaintaining the status quo. The MDH, serving a population of more than \nfive million people employs four to five student FTE's to interview all \nreported cases of foodborne disease in a timely and systematic manner \nat a cost of approximately $100,000 per year. Minnesota has made a \ngreater investment in epidemiologists and laboratory workers than most \nstates and we believe the stellar record of disease detection and \noutbreak response is a direct result. Extrapolating from the Minnesota \nexperience, we estimate that enhanced nationwide surveillance for \nSalmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and E. coli O157:H7 disease would \ncost between $25 million and $50 million additional per year \nnationwide. To put this number in perspective, a single case of \nhemolytic uremic syndrome, the direst consequence of E. coli O157:H7 \ninfection, costs between $\\1/2\\ to $1 million in medical costs alone, \nand a single death has been estimated to cost society approximately \n$6.2 million. Based on these estimates, it would take very few \nprevented cases per year to justify the entire investment.\n    We don't know how many cases of foodborne disease are being \nprevented by our current system, or how many cases could be prevented \nwith enhanced surveillance. We do know that since 1998, hundreds of \nmillions of pounds of contaminated food have been removed from the \nmarketplace and destroyed or discarded as the result of these \nactivities and have included such varied vehicles as peanut butter, \nground beef, breakfast cereal, almonds, frozen pizza, and stuffed \nchicken products. Surveillance has allowed us to identify unrecognized \nproblems in our food and water delivery systems that might continue for \nyears if not detected. Therefore, we believe it's safe to say that the \nnumber of cases of disease prevented by our current surveillance system \nis a very large number. Nevertheless, the consequences of these \noutbreaks remain high, and as we have described most outbreaks are \nprobably not recognized or resolved. As we have seen during the past \nseveral months and during the 2006 outbreak associated with fresh \nspinach, industry suffered extraordinary losses during protracted \noutbreak investigations. The cost of fixing our system is only a \nfraction of what industry loses in a single outbreak caused by delayed \nor inadequate investigation.\n    In conclusion, we do know how to greatly reduce foodborne diseases. \nWe believe that most food producers and distributors place high \npriority on delivering safe food to our tables. Furthermore, quality \nfoodborne disease surveillance and outbreak investigation fundamentally \nchanges the economics of food production, leveling the playing field \nbetween those that work hard to produce safe food and those that cut \ncorners. We must continue to improve food safety through better design \nand implementation of our food safety systems, promoting the use of \nfood irradiation and improving the traceability of implicated products \nwhen inevitable problems occur. With a minimal investment in foodborne \ndisease epidemiology resources and disease surveillance infrastructure, \nwe can greatly improve our ability to detect and respond quickly and \ncorrectly to unexpected problems such as the Salmonella serotype \nSaintpaul outbreak we are discussing today.\n    Thank you Mr. Chairman for this opportunity to share with you and \nthe other Subcommittee Members our experience and perspectives on this \nimportant issue. I'm happy to answer any questions you or the \nSubcommittee may have."

"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Mr. DiMare. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, \nMembers of the Subcommittee. My name is Tony DiMare. I am Vice \nPresident of DiMare Homestead Inc., DiMare Ruskin Inc. and \nDiMare Johns Island Inc. in South Carolina. I am pleased to \nhave this opportunity today to address this group.\n    The DiMare Company is an 80 year old family-owned produce \ncompany that grows, packs and ships tomatoes and other \nvegetables from seven states across the United States. And I \nmust say, in the 80 year history of our company, we have not \nhad any foodborne illness relating back or tracing back to any \none of our farms in that time period.\n    I represent the third generation of my family to carry on \nour produce business. I am a past Chairman of the Florida Fruit \nand Vegetable Association and currently serve on its executive \ncommittee and Board of Directors. I recently was elected to the \nUnited Fresh Produce Association Board of Directors. I also \nserve as President of the Florida Tomato Exchange and I am \nformer Chairman of the Florida Tomato Committee and the Florida \nTomato Growers Exchange. I was also appointed in 2002 to the \ninaugural USDA Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee.\n    Today I want to speak to you about our company's food \nsafety program, Florida's new mandatory food safety regulations \nfor tomato production and how DiMare Company was affected when \nthe CDC and FDA singled out tomatoes in the Salmonella \nSaintpaul outbreak.\n    Food safety is at the forefront of everything we do day in \nand day out at the DiMare Company. Not only do our customers \ndemand it, today's consumers expect that fresh produce they buy \nat the supermarket or eat in a restaurant is safe and \nnutritious. Simply put, ensuring food safety is the right thing \nto do. From our farms to our packing facilities and \ndistribution centers, the food safety team at the DiMare \nCompany works diligently to ensure all products are maintained \nin a food-safe environment at every stage of the process.\n    Our stringent internal food safety program includes monthly \nfacility audits and mock recalls throughout the year. Audits by \nthird-party companies ensure our program exceeds industry \nstandards. All DiMare fresh locations are audited twice a year \nby the American Institute of Baking and have received the \nhighest scores possible. Each of our farms is audited by Primus \nLabs and Davis Fresh. In addition, we routinely test our \nfields, facilities and all water sources for pathogens. We \nfollow good agricultural practices in our fields and best \nmanufacturing practices in our packing facilities.\n    Our company has invested significantly in technology and \npersonnel to ensure product traceability. All DiMare Company \nproduce can be traced back to the grower and all produce \noriginates from either DiMare farms or growers who participate \nin our food safety program.\n    Not only is the DiMare Company an industry leader in food \nsafety, the State of Florida is as well. On July 1 of this past \nyear, Florida became the first state in the country to adopt a \ncomprehensive food safety program with mandatory government \ninspection and audits for tomato handling, production and \npacking. Other states have inquired about the program as a \nmodel. The program includes annual registration of all \nproducers, packers and repackers of tomatoes in Florida. It \nalso requires regulatory inspections and audits by state \ninspectors from the Florida Department of Agriculture and \nConsumer Services.\n    Our industry was shaken to the core in June when the CDC \nannounced that tomatoes were a suspected source of the \nSalmonella outbreak and the FDA issued a broad advisory for all \nconsumers to avoid eating certain types of tomatoes. Shipments \nground to a halt. Tomatoes were left in the fields, in the \npackinghouses and on trucks that were turned away by our \ncustomers. More than a week went by before the FDA cleared 19 \nFlorida counties to ship tomatoes. By then, however, consumers \nwere too confused and were reluctant to resume buying tomatoes. \nSevere losses were incurred all along the distribution chain. \nEarly on, our sales were down as much as 60 percent and \nbusiness has been slow to pick up. Today our repack operations \nare still off by approximately ten to 20 percent.\n    Adding to our frustration during the traceback was the FDA \nand CDC's reluctance to turn to industry for help in \nunderstanding and identifying distribution channels, knowledge \nthey clearly lacked. Tapping into industry expertise early on \nwould have gone a long way in speeding up the traceback. More \ncooperation is clearly needed in the future.\n    In conclusion, even though the FDA has announced that all \ntomatoes are safe to eat and has focused its attention on other \nproduce, we urge both FDA and CDC to completely clear Florida \ntomatoes as a potential source of the outbreak. In addition, we \nare calling on these agencies and others to sit down with \nindustry to determine how the investigation and traceback \nprocess can be improved. Hard questions need to be asked and \nlessons must be learned from this outbreak so that a similar \nsituation never happens again.\n    Looking ahead, we don't know how long it will take for \nconsumer confidence in fresh tomatoes to rebound. What has \ntranspired over the past 2 months is sure to affect our \nbusiness into next season. As an industry, we are strongly \ncommitted to taking whatever proactive steps are necessary to \nensure Americans know they are consuming the safest, healthiest \nand most nutritious fresh produce possible.\n    I want to again thank the Committee and Chairman Cardoza \nfor this opportunity to speak to you today."

"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Mr. Giclas. Good afternoon, Chairman Cardoza, Members of \nthe Subcommittee. I am Hank Giclas, Vice President for \nStrategic Planning, Science and Technology at Western Growers, \na trade association representing growers, shippers and handlers \nof fresh fruits, nuts and vegetables in California and Arizona. \nOur 3,000 members produce approximately half of the United \nStates total production of fresh fruits, nuts and vegetables. \nWe appreciate the opportunity to speak before you on the \nSalmonella outbreak and its consequences for tomato growers.\n    The industry has a decades-long history of implementing \nfood safety improvements and has a commercial interest in \nensuring that only safe, wholesome, fresh produce is delivered \nto our customers' tables.\n    The issuance of a consumer alert relating to red round \ntomatoes has cost the California tomato industry millions of \ndollars to date. The nature of the alert has precluded industry \nfrom accessing established avenues of recourse such as \ninsurance programs to help with recovery. In addition, the lack \nof an effective, timely ``all clear'' message from public \nhealth authorities, a formalized restorative campaign for the \ncommodity and the continuing implication of additional \ncommodities have eroded consumer confidence such that losses \nare likely to increase. Keep in mind, these negative impacts \nare from growing regions that have not been implicated during \nthis outbreak.\n    On June 3, 2008, the FDA alerted consumers in New Mexico \nand Texas that a salmonellosis outbreak appeared to be linked \nto certain types of raw red tomatoes and products that may \ncontain them and warned consumers not to eat these products. A \nfew days later, the FDA expanded its warning to consumers \nnationwide. They did communicate that several areas had been \nexcluded as a potential source for suspect tomatoes but this \nnuanced message was largely lost on buyers, who avoided \npurchasing all tomatoes.\n    In a survey of Western Growers' tomato-producing members, \nindividual losses ranged from $400,000 to $3.4 million. They \nare mostly due to lower market prices related to poor demand. \nTo date, our members have experienced nearly $13 million in \nearly season losses at the farm gate related to this advisory \non tomatoes. The grower-level losses multiply as you add the \neconomic losses sustained at other points along the supply \nchain.\n    Consumer polls surveying attitudes about food safety found \nthat \\2/3\\ of consumers had stopped purchasing tomatoes and \nthat many consumers have changed their eating and buying habits \nover the past 6 months because they are afraid they could get \nsick by eating contaminated food.\n    Grower losses and waning consumer confidence are our \nprincipal rationale for being here today. When FDA takes action \nto issue a broad consumer warning, it is, for all practical \nintents and purposes, an international recall for that \ncommodity, regardless of production area or variety. It calls \ninto question the offerings of all producers, handlers, \nretailers and food service providers and causes immediate and \nlong-term damage to the marketplace. Today, months after the \noutbreak began, we still have no conclusive food items \nidentified as the source of these illnesses, and for every \nspeculation as to potential products, there is a negative \nmarketplace reaction.\n    FDA has access to expertise that can help guide the agency \nthrough the complexities of the produce supply chain quickly \nand efficiently. It is imperative for FDA to establish an \nincident command process, an outbreak team, if you will, that \nincludes industry experts that would be formally engaged from \nthe very beginning to assist the agency in their \ninvestigations. True reforms, improvements and enhanced \nprotection of both public health and industry cannot occur in a \nsiloed fashion. We must work together. The declaration of \noutbreaks, the management of traceback, the communication with \nindustry and the public must be reviewed and examined using \nthis outbreak and others as examples. We must look at effective \nmodels such as the Minnesota effort that recently outpaced FDA \nin the traceback on jalapenos.\n    Western Growers is here to ask that impacted growers be \nmade whole and for changes to be made in the way FDA and CDC \ninvestigate and communicate during outbreaks. The industry \nadopts measures constantly to improve the safety of our produce \nfor the protection of our customers, but what about our \nprotection? To exclude the industry from the investigative \nprocedures ignores knowledge and expertise that can be brought \nto bear to help bring outbreaks to swifter conclusions. \nInstead, our industry is left in ruins. We must be made whole \nand a new, more transparent, more participatory communications \nand investigative process must emerge from FDA and CDC.\n    I thank you for the opportunity to testify and look forward \nto the questions."

break,break,break,break
"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Mr. Silbermann. Chairman Cardoza, Members of the \nSubcommittee, my name is Bryan Silbermann, President of the \nProduce Marketing Association and I will briefly summarize my \nwritten comments.\n    PMA is the largest worldwide association of companies that \nmarket fresh fruits and vegetables. We represent 3,000 \ncompanies and their subsidiaries spanning the entire produce \nsupply chain. Since our start nearly 60 years ago, PMA has \npioneered packaging concepts for produce and served as a \nclearinghouse for standardization. Over the past 2 decades, \nthis Association and I personally have been at the center of \ndeveloping standards to improve the flow of information from \nproduce packinghouses to the consuming public. Mr. Chairman, \nthat includes those small stickers on the fruit and other items \nshipped from your district as well as standard barcodes on \npackaged produce. This involvement combined with our members' \ncommitment to provide fresh and wholesome fruit and vegetables \ncompel us to appear here today.\n    It has been said many times that food safety is the top \npriority for all our members and it has been that way for many \nyears. The deeply troubling spinach E. coli outbreak and the \nrecent Salmonella outbreak are tragedies that shake the \npublic's trust. Rather than casting blame, we want to and need \nto work on solutions. We all have a shared responsibility to \nprotect public health.\n    The produce industry has already changed rapidly to avoid \nthe introduction of risk into the food system. This paradigm \nshift brings with it new responsibilities, not just for us but \nalso for government. We cannot as an industry reflexively \noppose regulation but government action must recognize and \nharness the ingenuity of the private sector to improve food \nsafety and to gain back the full confidence of our consumers. \nAt the same time, it is not our role as the private sector to \nwait passively for government to regulate. We must act and we \nare already doing so.\n    Today's hearing is recognition that traceability is one key \nto the food safety process, and I would like to applaud Dr. \nOsterholm's comments about how it is a second step in the \nprocess that must follow associations done by public health \nauthorities. Unlike other food industries, the produce \nmarketing chain has been required to maintain records since the \n1930 passage of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act. \nThe Bioterrorism Act added the ``one up, one back'' concept, \nbut the requirement for comprehensive record-keeping has been a \nlongstanding legal obligation. Focusing exclusively on this \nlegal requirement misses the advancements we have made to \nimprove not just the retention of records but also the tracking \nof fresh produce.\n    Our companies have internal systems to track produce. \nHowever, the very handling needs of hundreds of different fresh \nfruits and vegetables and the diversity of systems needed to \nmanage them made us look to common elements to enhance and \nspeed up the link between these diverse approaches.\n    Last year PMA, United Fresh and CPMA launched a \ntraceability initiative to reach across the entire supply \nchain. This proposes that these three common elements use an \nexisting, standard, global format. I want to stress the words \n``global'' and ``standard'' because the solution we develop \nmust work for all fresh produce, no matter where it is grown or \nshipped. The three comments simply are, number one, a global \ntrade item number which identifies the supplier as well as the \nitem in the case, number two, the lot number, and number three, \nthe harvest or pack date. These three pieces of information \nwill be on each case in human readable form. By reading the \nlabel, one will know the supplier of the product and the lot \nnumber assigned. The information is also encoded in a barcode \neach company can scan, giving every handler a record of when \nthe case entered and left his facility. Think of these three \npieces of information as a baton that is passed by one runner \nin a relay race to the next. That common information then \ntravels and can be tracked from start line to finish. I also \nwant to stress, Mr. Chairman, that we have reached out as an \nindustry to brief both FDA and USDA officials on this work.\n    In less than a month, the initiative steering committee \nwill be meeting to approve an action plan and a timeline for \nimplementation. First, you will see produce suppliers begin \nlabeling cases with both human-readable and machine-readable \ninformation. Next, companies will begin reading and storing \nthis electronically. Through this process, we will have faster \nenhanced traceability across our supply chain.\n    As an industry, we take seriously our obligation to develop \nsolutions, not just the traceability initiative I have \ndescribed. We also must help determine what went wrong in the \nSalmonella investigation. That is why during this crisis, Mr. \nStenzel and I jointly wrote to Secretary Leavitt to offer our \nassistance in uncovering the source of the pathogen by lending \nindustry's unique knowledge of distribution and handling \nprocesses. We wrote again when our first letter went unanswered \nand only recently did we hear that we will eventually meet with \nFDA and CDC on this. We want to participate in jointly and \ntransparently learning lessons and improving regulators' \nprocess of traceback.\n    Just as we recognize our obligations, it is our profound \nhope that any future legislative and regulatory changes will be \nfashioned to work with the industry to fulfill our shared \nresponsibility, which is to protect public health by providing \nsafe, wholesome and nutritious food, every bite, every time.\n    Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to appear \nbefore you today. I look forward to answering your questions."

"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","        ``Our food safety system is not complete without a more robust \n        and quicker ability to rapidly recall our products and trace \n        their history. The issue of how to have improved traceability \n        is not about technology; it's about changing our business \n        practices. Effective traceability must be a business imperative \n        for everyone in our industry. Consumers and regulators demand \n        it.''"
break,break,break,break
"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    These words are even more true today. The initiative has moved \nquickly to create a standard methodology for maintaining key \ninformation. Comprised of more than major 50 produce buyers, sellers, \nbrokers, terminal markets, distributors and wholesalers, the Produce \nTraceability Initiative's Steering Committee acknowledges that each \nmember of the supply chain will have its own traceability system. \nHowever, these systems must be adapted so that important information \ncan flow through the supply chain in a common format that uses existing \nglobal information standards. I want to stress the word global, because \nthe solution we have developed must work for all fresh produce, no \nmatter where grown or shipped. I also want to stress that from the \ninitiative's beginning, we have briefed FDA and U.S. Department of \nAgriculture officials and others on our work.\n    As developed by the initiative, the process uses three pieces of \ninformation: (1) a Global Trade Item Number (GTIN), which will identify \nthe ``manufacturer'' of the product and the produce that is in that \nspecific case; (2) the lot number; and (3) the harvest or pack date. \nThese three pieces of information will be on each case so that the \nnumbers are intelligible to the human eye. Immediately, by reading that \ncase's label, you will know the origin of the product and the lot \nnumber assigned to it.\n    What is more, the information will also appear in machine-readable \nform on that label, in a barcode each member of the supply chain will \nbe required to scan so that the information will be maintained in its \ncomputer system. Having the specific lot number and pack or harvest \ndate, each handler will have a record of when that particular case \nentered and left its facility. Think of these three pieces of \ninformation as a baton that is passed by one runner in a relay race to \nthe next; that common information then travels--and can be tracked--\nfrom the start to the finish lines.\n    The Produce Traceability Initiative's process avoids a bloated and \nunworkable central computer system to warehouse all of the data for an \nentire industry that ships in this country alone more than five billion \ncases of produce annually. Because the three pieces of information will \nbe standard, and because each link in the supply chain will scan that \ninformation into its computer systems, each link will be able to \ndetermine with a quick computer search the origin of the produce and \nits destination. These searches can be done simultaneously rather than \nsequentially--so we can get answers faster.\n    The process works the same when a commodity is ``repacked.'' When \nrepackers commingle produce from multiple growers into one case or \nsimply repack the case, they become the new ``manufacturer.'' As such, \nthey will be responsible for assigning a new GTIN (now showing them as \nthe new ``manufacturer'') to that new case, as well as the \ncorresponding lot number and pack date. They must also establish a link \nbetween the new GTIN and the original GTINs and associated lot numbers \nand pack or harvest dates.\n    In less than 1 month from today, the steering committee for the \ninitiative will meet to approve and release to industry an action plan \nalong with a timeline for implementation throughout the industry. \nFirst, produce suppliers will be directed to have the capacity to label \ncases with both human-readable and machine-readable information; next, \neveryone in the supply chain will be expected to read and store that \ninformation--and chainwide traceability will have been achieved.\n    The Produce Traceability Initiative relies on several elements that \nwill be the keys to its success. It relies on core pieces of \ninformation that are consistent across the supply chain, and are \nmaintained on the case itself. Each participant in the supply chain \nretains that consistent information electronically. The initiative \nbuilds on the individual traceback systems that currently populate the \nmarketing chain, by knitting a common thread among them.\nConclusion\n    Whole-chain traceability, we believe, is our responsibility to the \npublic and the produce industry takes seriously its obligations to \ndevelop traceability solutions. These solutions include not just the \nProduce Traceability Initiative I have described today; it also \nincludes helping to determine what when wrong when the tomato industry \nwas apparently wrongly fingered as the culprit in the Salmonella \noutbreak. During this crisis, PMA and United Fresh jointly wrote to \nSecretary Leavitt, of the Department of Health and Human Services, to \noffer our assistance in uncovering the source of the pathogen by \nlending the industry's unique knowledge of distribution and handling \nprocesses. This information could and should serve as the key to unlock \nthe Salmonella mystery. We wrote again when our first letter went \nunanswered, and only recently did we get an assurance that we would \neventually get to meet with FDA on these matters. In the coming months, \nwe also want to participate in learning lessons and in improving \nregulators' traceback in light of ongoing industry efforts.\n    Just as we recognize our obligations, it is our profound hope that \nany future legislative and regulatory changes will be fashioned to work \nwith the industry to fulfill our shared responsibility to protect \npublic health by providing safe, wholesome and nutritious food, every \nbite, every time.\n    I thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today, and I \nlook forward to answering any questions you may have. Thank you."

break,break,break,break
"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Mr. Stenzel. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Members \nof the Committee. It is a pleasure to be here. We appreciate \nyou holding this hearing. United Fresh Produce Association \nrepresents the total supply chain in the fresh produce \nindustry, concentrated here doing business in the North \nAmerican market but also globally as well.\n    I am going to summarize my comments at this late hour. I \nsubmitted an extensive written testimony for the Committee. Let \nme start with prevention. That is where it all starts. We in \nthe produce industry hold ourselves to rigorous standards in \ngrowing and handling fresh foods and we support strong Federal \noversight of commodity-specific risk-based rules. We have \nworked closely with Mr. Costa and Mr. Putnam in the development \nof their legislation and urge the Committee to lend its support \nto those efforts.\n    We are also committed to compliance with the traceability \nrules of the Bioterrorism Act in ensuring our industry's \nability to track fresh produce from the retail store or \nrestaurant all the way back to the farm. I want to say that \nthis is true also for all produce sold in the United States, \nnot just grown in the United States. We in the produce industry \nhave an obligation that whenever consumers go to their grocery \nstore or restaurant, it doesn't matter where it is grown, it is \nnot ``safe in one place and not safe in another.'' It is our \nresponsibility to assure no matter where produce is being \nconsumed by American citizens, it is safe.\n    Now, in this particular outbreak, I want to make one thing \nvery, very clear. Traceability worked. I thank Dr. Osterholm \nfor making this point so it is not just an industry point of \nview. FDA was in fact able to trace tomatoes back that had been \neaten by sick consumers all the way to the farm. The only \nproblem was that those tracebacks kept pointing to different \nfarms. But those aren't false leads. Those aren't tracebacks \nthat didn't work. Those are tracebacks that pointed to the fact \nthat there was not a common point of contamination for all \nthose tomatoes. Very, very early in this investigation, we \nshould have known that tomatoes were not the sole cause of all \nof those illnesses across 43 states. Perhaps there is yet \njudgment to be made as to any plausible explanation of tomatoes \nhaving been involved at all. We don't think so but we will hold \nour judgment as well. But early on everyone should have known \nthat tomatoes were not the sole cause of this outbreak.\n    We hear complaints about traceability and how difficult it \nis, but the stories about FDA having to pour through boxes and \nboxes of records just don't ring true to those of in the \nindustry, to Mr. DiMare, who can track his tomatoes up and down \nthe supply chain, and even to investigators such as those in \nMinnesota, who were able to describe tracking product back very \nquickly. Even in the Minnesota case, I might add, from a very \nsmall restaurant, not a national chain; but the ability to find \nout where that product came from, go all the way back and, as \nDr. Osterholm said, finger the exact tiny distribution center \non the border of McAllen, Texas, and eventually get back to the \nfarm. The fact that we now have positive identical samples on \njalapeno peppers from these facilities is just remarkable. In \nfact, this would be my exhibit for traceability working, that \nDr. Acheson showed you, this chart. Look at that ability. Once \nthey started looking for jalapenos, they got there very, very \nquickly.\n    The produce industry understands better than anyone that we \nhave the most to gain from isolating produce that may be part \nof a problem, and that goes to the initial identification of \nwhat is the food vehicle involved. In this particular case, it \nis clear that CDC did not have the right story from the \nbeginning. Whether they were 100 percent wrong, we do not know \nyet. But clearly when they issued a broad warning that tomatoes \nwere that cause of this outbreak, there was no mention of \njalapenos. They had missed something in the early outbreak \nidentification. That is something that we just have to look at, \nnot so much the traceability back but look at that initial \nidentification of product.\n    This past Friday, FDA concluded that jalapenos grown in the \nUnited States were not associated with this outbreak, and that \nis indeed very good news. We have growers now who are once \nagain shipping truckloads of jalapenos from North Carolina and \nGeorgia, and that is important. But you know what? It is also \nimportant that there are a lot of Mexican producers of \njalapenos who also are not involved in this outbreak either. We \nhave to narrow the suspicion down to the ultimate source. We \ncan never let geographical boundaries, whether national or \nstate or county borders, be shorthand for food safety, and I \nremind the Committee that in the spinach outbreak, we went \nthrough this exact same problem when three counties in \nCalifornia were all labeled under suspicion equally when we \nknow that there was only one place where there was contaminated \nproduct. So geography is not shorthand for food safety.\n    Mr. Chairman, let me conclude my remarks with a brief \ncomment about compensation. We would like to thank Congressman \nMahoney for your efforts to step up with the bill to provide \ndisaster assistance. What a true disaster this has been, as \nmuch as any hurricane or flood in our industry, but it is a \ndisaster that struck our entire industry. It struck the entire \ntomato supply chain, whether our growers who were plowing under \nfields or others in wholesale and upstream had to take product \nout to the dump. As you consider potential support for the \ntomato industry, I ask you to think about both the growers we \nrepresent but also their customers who had already paid for \nthat produce and also took losses in having to throw it away \nunnecessarily.\n    Thank you."
break,break,break,break
"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Stenzel.\n    I would share with you that your last point is well taken. \nMr. Etheridge and I have had significant discussions already \nabout how we deal with whether or not crop insurance could be \nmade the risk holder for this. Certainly compensation is a \nconcern if you look to FDA or someone who is actually making \nthe adjudication for compensation. While in my opinion they \nhave made some errors or potentially have made some errors, how \nwould compensation affect their future judgments to make the \nsame kind of calls? Frankly, we need them to be able to make \ncalls that are not based upon whether they have to take money \nout of their agency for compensation.\n    So Mr. Etheridge, Mr. Peterson, other Members, and I have \nbeen talking about how we go about looking at the compensation \nthat should somehow come back to this industry that has been \nimplicated but not necessarily indicted. I know the growers in \nmy area have been devastated and it is nothing they have done \nof their own doing. So I can't imagine any other businessman \nwho would subject themselves to the vagaries of the weather, to \npestilence, to all the rest and then also submit themselves to \nthe regulatory agencies; farmers are certainly a hearty breed \nand they keep doing it. I often ask myself why they do. I know \nthe answer, because they love what they do, but they ultimately \nhave to make a profit at the end of the day, and we have seen \nan industry just be devastated here, and I thank you and Mr. \nGiclas and Mr. DiMare, all of you for your testimony.\n    I have a number of questions. I want to start out with Dr. \nOsterholm. What did Minnesota do differently from other states \nin their investigation that led to the implication of peppers \ndirectly?\n    Dr. Osterholm. Mr. Chairman, first of all, they had the bad \nor good luck, I guess, depending on how you look at it, of \nactually having cases occur that were all associated with one \nof two restaurants, local restaurants in the Twin Cities that \nmade it easier to investigate. But the most important reason is \nthat Minnesota has dedicated foodborne disease surveillance and \noutbreak investigation as a very high priority, and as such, \nthey actually have a team of graduate students known \naffectionately as Team Diarrhea, that literally on a real-time \nbasis are interviewing case reports that are coming in on a \ndaily basis. Our turnaround time for the pulsed-field gel \nelectrophoresis and the analysis is less than 3 days every time \nso that in fact this group has solved many outbreaks. Last year \nwe had an outbreak of a rare kind of Salmonella that had been \noccurring in the United States for the better part of 6 months. \nWhen the first three cases occurred in Minnesota, within \nliterally 1 week, Minnesota fingered the potpies and broke open \nthe entire national investigation that had gone nowhere for 6 \nmonths.\n    So I think what it is, is a system. In my written testimony \nto you, I actually lay out what we do, how we do it. It is not \nrocket science. It is commitment. It is willingness to do it. \nIt is not accepting a state like Texas that takes 5 weeks to \nget their pulsed-field gel electrophoresis results done. It is \nthe fact that we don't wait for a county health official to \ndecide they are not going to go ahead and interview a patient. \nIt is all done centrally. We believe that this entire system \ncould be replicated across all 50 states for somewhere between \n$50 million and $100 million annually. When you think about the \ncost of one of these outbreaks getting missed, that seems like \na small amount of money to put forward. I tell you this at the \ntime when the Federal resources for this are being cut so that \njust as we are talking about this right now, the very support \nthat has happened over the 4 years for all the states is being \ncut. So I think that is the big distinction. Minnesota made it \na priority. They have done it. They showed it can be done and \nwe just have to hold all the other 49 states to the same \nstandard.\n    The Chairman. I totally agree with you.\n    To all our panelists, prior to and during the recent \nwarnings concerning tomatoes, what input were you asked for by \nthe CDC and the FDA and what input did you give these agencies, \neither solicited or unsolicited? Mr. Stenzel, we will just go \ndown the line and start with you. Since you spoke last, we will \ngive you the first shot and go the other direction.\n    Mr. Stenzel. Prior to the issuance of the warnings, no \ninput whatsoever. We were not asked or consulted. In fact, \nthere was a very quick notification by FDA to the industry that \nNew Mexico believed that tomatoes had been associated with this \noutbreak and quickly CDC was going to be issuing a public \nstatement. So no input there. During the course of the \ninvestigation, I appreciate and would thank Dr. Acheson for his \nefforts to keep the industry informed. They did reach out and \nshare information with us, but one of the most frustrating \nthings about this process is, there was a lot of information \nthey either couldn't share or wouldn't share and they were very \nslow to take any kind of input back from the industry, and I \nhave to be specific. Specifically, one of my concerns is with \nCDC. We repeatedly were asking for data on how the illnesses \nhad occurred, in what order, what geographic locations.\n    For us in the industry, we can look at the spread of an \nillness, and if it is moving from Texas to New Mexico and then \nup to Illinois, we can look at our own distribution patterns \nfor tomatoes. Quickly, once we got past about ten or 15 states, \nwe knew this was not all related to tomatoes. There is no \nsingle point, there is no one farm, there are no repackers who \nwould process all of those tomatoes to all of those geographies \nyet they didn't really listen to that point of view.\n    Mr. Silbermann. Mr. Chairman, I would agree with everything \nMr. Stenzel has said. I would thank Dr. Acheson for his \noutreach once the announcements were made and the way in which \nFDA briefed us, but I would draw a parallel. Imagine that you \nare an orthopedic surgeon and you are being asked to do surgery \nwith an arthroscopic device and you can't see down that \narthroscopic device to see what is inside the body. That is the \nway we felt, quite honestly at PMA, giving a lot of \ninformation, not seeing the endpoint, not seeing the picture \nbut being asked to comment on it. That is the way we felt in \nthis process.\n    Mr. DiMare. We at the DiMare Company were contacted by FDA \nat a couple different levels. One of our repack locations in \nHouston was contacted through one of the tracebacks with \ntomatoes. One of the problems I had with FDA was I felt first \nof all that some of the people from FDA that did the \ninvestigation had no experience on the food side. We had a \nperson that was from the drug side that was in the operation. \nAlso, we had, I think it was about a week-long process of a \nfull audit of our facility without again any relation or \ntracing back of any positive evidence that any of the tomatoes \nthat we were distributing contained the Salmonella Saintpaul \noutbreak. From a grower packing level, we were contacted by FDA \nin both our Ruskin and Homestead operations, again from a \ntraceback that led back to some of the customers that we \nsupplied--had supplied in this one case a retailer actually in \nGeorgia led the traceback back to our two packing facilities \nand it happened to be specifically on plum and Roma tomatoes, \nnot round tomatoes.\n    The investigator in our Homestead operation who I had \nspoken to on the phone personally several times, it was a very \nfrustrating process. It was frustrating in the sense that he \nreally didn't know what he was asking for, a lower-level FDA \nperson that was being given directives from the higher ups \nabove within FDA. In fact, the questioning started out when he \nfirst contacted me as he wanted to see information and all \ninformation on all tomatoes in all our operations. I said are \nyou sure you want to see information on all types of tomatoes \nin all the operations, that is a lot of information you are \nasking for, I prefer that you name something specifically. Is \nit Romas, is it rounds, which location are you looking for. I \nwas then contacted by an official from FDA out of the Tampa \noffice that did the follow-up in our Ruskin location. She was \nvery specific in what she wanted and I asked her, do you want \nto see information on all round and Roma tomatoes or just one \ntype specifically. She stated very clearly we are looking at \nspecifically Roma tomatoes and we are looking at it for this \nparticular window. It was about a week or 10 day period of \nshipment that they were looking for. That is a heck of a lot \ndifferent from the information I got from the other \ninvestigator----\n    The Chairman. Mr. DiMare, let me stop you because we are \ngoing over, but this is really important to the Committee. You \nhave indicated in your testimony that you do over-sampling much \ngreater than maybe--you do a lot of sampling for pathogens in \nyour company.\n    Mr. DiMare. Yes, sir.\n    The Chairman. Did you share that information with FDA or \nCDC?\n    Mr. DiMare. Yes. In fact, in the Houston case, some of the \nproduct that they were looking at was product actually of our \nown. In other words, it actually came from our own farm packing \noperations, which is not unusual. In this particular case, it \nwas product that we actually grew and packed, and in those \ninstances, we had done pathogen testing specifically for \nSalmonella.\n    The Chairman. Thank you. I am going to have to move you \nalong, and there is a rationale why I am asking this question. \nWhen you passed on that information, did it have any impact on \ntheir investigation?\n    Mr. DiMare. I am not sure it did. The only comment I got \nback from the investigator in Homestead was to the extent that \nit is good that you did that, but as Dr. Osterholm said about \ntesting is that we are not going to test our way out of this.\n    The Chairman. No, I understand. I have a follow-up I am \ngoing to ask you all, but I want to hear from Mr. Giclas and \nthen we are going to ask you a follow-up.\n    Mr. Giclas. Mr. Chairman, I don't have much to add. Mr. \nStenzel and Mr. Silbermann outlined the type of communication \nbetween trade associations and the agency during the outbreak. \nI can tell you that the types of questions that we got were not \nvery constructive questions. They were, what can you tell us \nabout distribution patterns, and we had to ask additional \nquestions about well, distribution patterns need to be outlined \na little bit more specifically before we can really answer \nthose. But we tried to answer any kind of question that was \nraised by the agency during the course of the investigation. \nWhat I can also tell you is that some of the questions that we \nasked have been put off until this outbreak investigation is \nconcluded and behind us and we have an opportunity to sit down, \nbut they are important questions like what is failing in \ntraceback. We have heard over and over and over that traceback \nsystems are failing and we have asked for people to show us \nwhere, how. If that is actually the case, industry wants to fix \nthat as quickly as possible because it is in everybody's best \ninterest to have those programs----\n    The Chairman. That is my understanding and experience as \nwell, sir, so that is my follow-up question is, oftentimes from \nmy colleagues, I get well, it is the industry, they just want \nto protect their profits. They don't understand that protecting \ntheir profits means not having outbreaks because the minute you \nhave an outbreak, you are devastated. It is the death sentence \nfor many of these farmers. And so my point is, how do we \ncommunicate back from industry to FDA and CDC more effectively. \nWhat I am told is, you are pretty much kept in the dark, asked \nquestions that sometimes may apply but your experience may be \nmuch greater than the FDA's experience. What I found, is state \ndepartments of agriculture oftentimes have much more experience \nthan the Federal Government either at USDA or at FDA. Can any \nof you comment on that? And Dr. Osterholm, we will start back \nand we will let you sum up.\n    Mr. Giclas. Well, I will be very brief. We would welcome \nthat. I think there are models, perhaps the Minnesota model \nwhere there are state departments of agriculture that are \nfundamentally involved. I know in California, they also involve \nstate departments of agriculture and those are the two states \nthat I know of that have the most robust traceback programs \ntoday.\n    The Chairman. Mr. DiMare, quickly.\n    Mr. DiMare. Your question again?\n    The Chairman. What inputs and what methods could you better \nprovide FDA and CDC with information that they are not asking \nthe right questions?\n    Mr. DiMare. Well, in this case here, to me, go back to the \ninitial outbreak of April 10 and you look at the timeframe and \nlook at where tomatoes were coming or being produced at that \ntime of the year. You look at the initial outbreaks in New \nMexico and Texas, which seemed to have the most outbreaks, and \nthen Illinois. Knowing the distribution channels, knowing where \nproducts come from for that particular time of the year. There \nis no doubt in my mind the product didn't come from Florida, \nwhether it be tomatoes or jalapenos now. Again, you look at \nthose distribution channels where product is flowing from, that \nis the thing that was frustrating for me.\n    The Chairman. If they are not ripe there, they are probably \nnot coming from there. That is your point?\n    Mr. DiMare. Yes.\n    The Chairman. That is pretty much common sense.\n    Mr. Silbermann.\n    Mr. Silbermann. Mr. Chairman, the letters that Mr. Stenzel \nand I have written to Secretary Leavitt laid that out. I think \nwe really have to have a standing type of communication system \nso that it is not just dealing with each crisis when it comes \nup, and our written testimony deals with that too.\n    The Chairman. That is one thing that troubles me, sir, and \nI know I am going way over my time. But, that is one of the \nthings that troubles me because I thought we had gotten past \nsome of this with the leafy green protocols, and we are going \nto get to in just a moment Mr. Stenzel and Dr. Osterholm, then \nI am going to turn it over to my colleagues.\n    Mr. Stenzel. I thought a lot about this. FDA is a \nregulatory agency. They are the cops and they treat industry \nlike you are being investigated, like you did something wrong, \nand maybe one person did but they are treating the entire \nindustry that way. I am going to suggest to the Energy and \nCommerce Committee a new system to bring industry expertise \ninto the process ahead of time, to perhaps have a security \nclearance, something by which the agencies could vet and clear \npeople who are experts. There are experts in jalapeno peppers \nin growing and production and distribution that we still \nhaven't heard from, and we have to find a way to bring that \nexpertise in a way that the cops still feel comfortable with."
"costa","Mr. Costa","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Would the gentleman yield?\n    The Chairman. Sure."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    This precisely points to the question that I \nasked the FDA spokesperson in the first panel, whether or not \nthey had people in the field that had expertise. I think it is \nvery clear that they don't have people, Mr. Chairman, in the \nfield that have expertise. They are spread too thin and this \nmost recent round of investigations points very clearly to \nthat. Your point, I think makes the most amount of sense.\n    First of all, all of these growers here are consumers. They \neat tomatoes. Their families and friends eat tomatoes. Number \ntwo, if they send out products that are not good quality \nproducts, healthy products, the market drops. I mean, they have \na vested interest. And so when I asked the FDA witness earlier \nwhat regulations that prevented, as you said, a surgeon trying \nto do surgery on a knee using arthroscopic and not being able \nto see, you are being asked to provide information. You can \nprovide help. You want to get to the bottom of it. The quicker \nyou get this cleared, the better chance you restore confidence \nof the American consumers to resume purchasing the product. \nThis is not rocket science. And so I appreciate your yielding, \nbut I think that clearly we have pointed out this afternoon \nwhere the breakdown in this whole traceback process is that \nneeds to be fixed.\n    The Chairman. Well, Mr. Costa, I think you are absolutely \nright, and the problem we are having, you, Mr. Mahoney, and I, \na lot of us have spent time on a farm. We spent time on a farm \nand we spent time in the coffee shops and we hear the farmers \ncomplaining about the fact that they can solve some of these \nmysteries that sometimes happen very quickly because it is \ncommon sense to them because they deal with it every day. But \nthat information is not percolating back to the bureaucrats in \nWashington and it is what frustrates the heck of the American \npopulation all the time. They are both being afflicted by an \noutbreak, the industry is being destroyed and they are not \nbeing able to help their government make the right call. That \nis the problem that we are facing here.\n    Dr. Osterholm.\n    Dr. Osterholm. Mr. Chairman, I think that all the points \nmade are getting to a central point but I think they are \nmissing the point. The point is, the information that needs to \nbe added at a critical time like that critical ingredient in \nthe chocolate chip cookie dough is not the FDA. At the time \nthat you are trying to track back the product, you have already \nidentified a trend. You have identified a geographic set of \ncases. You identified a time sequence. You have identified a \nkind of restaurant or a location where it is purchased. That is \nstate and local public health at the CDC. That is where I think \nthe critical input is needed. In Minnesota, when I was State \nEpidemiologist, every time we had an outbreak of any kind, the \nfirst thing I did was assemble a group of local business \nexperts in that particular commodity whether it was red meat or \nproduce. More often that not, they helped solve it. By the time \nthis gets to the FDA for the traceback, in a sense the \nfootprint has already been set.\n    So I think I would support your point very much that this \ninput is needed. I think the industry folks are absolutely \nright. In fact, many of the people down this table I have \ntalked to in past outbreaks where I was actually leading them. \nI think the FDA, to follow up one point, has learned some \nissues around traceback with this outbreak and I give them \ngreat credit. I think the last days of the outbreak, they have \ntaken some different approaches and sped up their process and \nactually I think to their credit have done quite a good job.\n    And let me just last comment, being a government bureaucrat \nis obviously a tough job when you are in the crossfire, and I \ndo want to give Dr. Acheson great credit because I have had \ngreat access to him to give my input and comments. I think that \nhe is trying but he has a whole system he has to deal with. I \nthink today that as much as we all want to find the reason why \nthings went wrong, it is not Dr. Acheson and I think we are \nvery fortunate to have him.\n    The Chairman. I hope I haven't given that impression. In \nfact----\n    Dr. Osterholm. You haven't. I just want to be sure everyone \nknows that.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Dr. Osterholm. I agree with \neverything you have said and what you have done. I am getting \nready to turn it over to Mr. Mahoney, but I have to say one \nlast thing. Early on in this hearing, I indicated that my wife, \nthe family doctor, said that public health is the fundamental \nthing that we need to shore up in America, and I think you have \njust made it even more clear that my wife was right again.\n    Mr. Mahoney."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","costa","Mr. Costa","    And Mr. Chairman, you are always right.\n    I just have a couple of comments and questions. I mean, \nunfortunately, I don't get to live in Minnesota so we are not \nblessed to have this wonderful capability across the country. I \ndo agree with Dr. Osterholm in one perspective, and that is, I \nthink that the issue that is coming out today is really not \ntraceback, it is making sure that we are implementing the right \nprocedures and standards to make sure that the food is grown in \nthe proper way and being delivered properly to begin with. I \nthink traceback will happen if we implement a uniform system. \nAnd it is also clear to me that unfortunately in this \nparticular example in the testimony given today by Dr. Acheson, \nis that when we go down to Mexico and we are taking a look at \nwhat is happening down there and the standards under which \nproduce is being grown, that there is a big inequity between \ndomestic production and foreign production and our ability to \nkeep track of it. So I think that that is something I will walk \naway with.\n    One of the other things now I am concerned about, and I \nguess I am going to start with Mr. DiMare, is that when I met \nwith my growers, and none of them were tomato growers, but when \nI met with my growers in my district, I was asking them about \nstandards. It appeared to me that one of the things we are \ndealing with is that the bigger producers are dealing with a \nwhole range of standards, some from the State of Florida, \nothers from big resellers, big buyers. Is that true? I mean, \nhow many--you know, you are operating in multiple states. I \nmean, how many different sets of standards are you working \ntowards in terms of what you have to produce and what you have \nto report?\n    Mr. DiMare. Well, you are right. There are many, depending \non what customer you are dealing with. Right now, we are \ngetting a lot of pressure because of this with customers \nwanting to do pre-harvest pathogen testing, but there is no \nscientific base or parameters right now to go by. This is part \nof the problem I have with all of the testing is, you don't \nhave any true standards in place for industry to follow. And, \ndifferent customers are demanding different things at different \nlevels and that is very frustrating and----"
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Also very costly.\n    Mr. DiMare. It is very, very costly, and I guess that is \nwhat we are trying to do through the associations is trying to \ncome up with standardization that is unified across the board. \nSo that, we are all complying with the same standards of \nwhatever the food safety audit, whether it is going to be \nPrimus based, whether it is going to be Davis Fresh, whether it \nis going to be AIB, that the standard level be the same for all \nproducers across the board."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Let me ask another question to all of you, and \nthat is, I had the pleasure, I guess, now that I am no longer \ninvolved in it, of being a small cattle rancher, never made any \nmoney because all of my cows had first names, so I was at a \ndisadvantage. But when we were talking about immigration of \ncattle and trying to understand how that works, I know that in \nthe cattle industry, a disproportionate amount of the cattle \nproduced in this country comes from small ranchers. One of the \nconcerns that I have as we move down this path in terms of \ntraceback, in terms of implementing systems of accountability, \nis the small producer. One of the questions I would have for \nyou is, that if there are all of the different regulatory \naspects, whether imposed by the state, the Federal Government \nor by large customers, what is your experience? What is the \nability for American agriculture to be able to deal with that, \nnot from just the perspective of the big producers but the \nsmall farmer? And why don't we start with Mr. Giclas.\n    Mr. Giclas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Congressman Mahoney. I \nthink the industry is capable. Smaller growers tend to have a \nrelationship with their receivers. Larger growers tend to have \nthe more robust record-keeping and traceback programs in place. \nThere are legal requirements for everybody, going back to Mr. \nSilbermann's comment about PACA, which is in the grower's best \ninterest to keep those records because that is how they ensure \nthat they are paid for their products. They have a motivation \nto maintain and keep those records."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Mr. Silbermann.\n    Mr. Silbermann. I would just add that anyone who is packing \na vegetable product, let us say, in a box, would have the \ncapability of attaching the kind of label that we are talking \nabout, the standard label that has the three pieces of \ninformation fairly easily. If they are going to have a packing \nline, they certainly would be able to do that. But it is \ndefinitely an issue for very small local growers who might be \ndelivering just to one or two stores. That is clearly an issue \nthat needs to be looked at."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    By the way, I will just point out that one of \nthe things that I was just working with Wal-Mart on is the fact \nthat they are now having a new program where they are going to \nreach out to local growers. I can tell you that in these tough \neconomic times, going to these farmers' markets, there is a lot \nof people now that have decided that they are going to turn \ntheir back 40, if you will, their half-acre, into an \nalternative income source by growing vegetables and trying to \nsell them. So I am seeing that happening.\n    Mr. Stenzel.\n    Mr. Stenzel. Two quick things on that. I think the small \nproducer is going to be able to put the information on the \ncase. For now, most of them do. It may be the company's name of \nthe farm's name, that type of thing, but as I said, anybody who \nis packing a box of produce. The standardization effort that we \nare trying to lead from an association standpoint just gets \neverybody on the same numbering system. So there is an \neducation part of that, an outreach, but it is no more costly \nthan just putting information on the case. We think that would \ngo a long way.\n    I do want to mention one other thing though, when you talk \nabout a lot of small farmers coming in. One of the toughest \nthings we are going to have to do is help them as well with the \ngood agricultural practices to prevent illness because they may \nnot be part of other organizations and have had the education. \nWe have to make sure that anybody who is going to be growing \nproduce, even on a very small scale, meets those same food \nsafety standards and prevention."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    One last question. Do we need to have more \naggressive oversight and making sure that foreign producers are \nmeeting our standards? Dr. Osterholm?\n    Dr. Osterholm. Congressman, can I just quickly answer the \nlast question too?"
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    No.\n    Dr. Osterholm. Okay, because that is a key piece. You are \nonto a very important issue beyond what you realize. I want to \nanswer."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    I get in trouble if I go too long. I am a \nfreshman, so they only give me so much time.\n    Dr. Osterholm. Well, let me just tell you, that is an \nimportant point because I think the small producer is going to \nbe a critical problem with food safety, and we have to \nunderstand that right now, so I will just say that and leave it \nat that."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Okay.\n    Dr. Osterholm. As far as the issue of the--I am sorry, your \nsecond question?"
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Foreign producers.\n    Dr. Osterholm. Foreign producers. I think we have to be \nvery careful about that in the sense that yes, we do have \noutbreaks with foreign producers. They have been a problem. But \nagain, if you are big and you can actually make the investment \ninto food safety, you can do it safely wherever you are at. \nWhat I worry about is, as I said in my testimony. It is the \n99.1 versus .9 percent rule, whatever. When you have the \nindustry, be careful how you label that. There are always a few \nout there who are going to take and cut corners for costs. They \nare the ones that more often than not have become the problem."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    I have to tell you, I disagree with you, \nbecause what I heard today from the FDA is the fact that they \nare under-funded, under-sourced. They are not checking to make \nsure that the growers are doing their job overseas and there is \nvery little oversight or inspection when these things are \ncoming in.\n    Dr. Osterholm. I don't disagree. What I am saying is----"
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    And I am just saying, I take a look at my \ntomato growers in Florida and I take a look at what the State \nof Florida requires these folks to do and I think that it is an \nalarming situation.\n    Mr. Stenzel.\n    Mr. Stenzel. Congressman, exactly what the State of Florida \nand the tomato growers are being required is a self-motivated \nprocess. Our tomato industry, and I don't want to speak for Mr. \nDiMare or others here in the hearing room, has gone out of its \nway to build those new processes and have the state inspect. \nBut that is precisely what we all want across all tomato \nproduction regions including Mexico. It is not a matter of one \nversus the other. Congressman Costa's bill and Congressman's \nPutnam's bill would do precisely that, get to a common platform \nfor preventive control for all production. So I really think it \nis important that the industry itself is asking for that \nincluding the Mexican producers.\n    Mr. Silbermann. I would also add, Congressman, that many \nlarge American producers are also producing products in Mexico \nand taking some of the best practices to Mexico and requiring \nthat Mexican product is produced with exactly the same \nstandards. They have their own brand identity to protect when \ntheir product is shipped, whether it is in Mexico or the United \nStates."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    I don't think that is the problem. I think it \nis the local producer.\n    Mr. DiMare. I would agree with that. I think it behooves us \nas an industry to implement a program that is standardized, \nwhether it is domestically or in Mexico, because in this case, \nas you can see, even if it wasn't a relation to your operation \ntied to the outbreak, we all suffered fairly equally. So I \nthink it behooves us to make sure those standards are not only \npassed on to the rest of this nation but certainly to all \nimports coming into this country.\n    Mr. Giclas. I really don't have anything to add other than \nto reinforce Mr. DiMare's point. We are only as strong as our \nweakest link, and we would like to see everybody on the same \nlevel playing field."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Can I ask one last question quickly?\n    The Chairman. Let me let Mr. Costa, and then we will give \nyou a whole other round if we need to. Mr. Costa."
"costa","Mr. Costa","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n    Mr. Stenzel, what percentage of your members would you say \ntoday have electronic records to trace their products through \nthe distribution chain?\n    Mr. Stenzel. Gosh, I am going to have to estimate. I will \ngo back and try to get a better estimate for you. Electronic \ninterchange, the ability to have a computer record somewhere, I \nwould say more than 50 percent would have those records. I \nthink something earlier that was said, the PACA really has \nproduced a greater record-keeping for produce companies and \nproduce traders than most people realize. What we are lacking \nin some areas is the ability for those computer systems to talk \nto each other but the ability for an individual to do it is \nthere."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    So a mandatory tracing effort, your industry \ncould adjust to it?\n    Mr. Stenzel. Well, adjust to and find a particular program \nthat makes the most sense. We have heard already today that \ntraceability was not the problem in this outbreak."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    Right.\n    Mr. Stenzel. We know we can traceback. We can traceback \nwithin, relatively, a matter of hours or days. The question \nthat will come is, what type of system and to what cost and \nwhat benefit."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    And that is why that is very important to all of \nus because you had actually answered the question a moment ago. \nI was going to ask, is there any legislation out here that has \nbeen proposed that you think would address these issues that we \nare talking about today. The answer was?\n    Mr. Stenzel. The answer is no."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    There is no proposed legislation that has been \nintroduced that----\n    Mr. Stenzel. Well, with a little bit of encouragement----"
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    That is a leading question.\n    Mr. Stenzel. I said a couple times that obviously the Safe \nFEAST Act that you and Congressman Putnam have introduced we \nbelieve takes care of that. It doesn't have the traceability \nprovision that Congresswoman DeGette's bill does but we don't \nnecessarily feel that that is the critical factor."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    In terms of maximizing risk assessment versus \nrisk management to ensure public safety of health.\n    Mr. Stenzel. Absolutely. To ensure public safety, we have \nto prevent the illnesses from ever occurring. Traceback is not \nthe problem."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    Mr. DiMare, the tomato industry has made some \nmajor advances, and the last time your industry had an \nimplicated food safety issue I believe was 2004. Would you like \nto talk about the differences today between 4 years ago?\n    Mr. DiMare. Yes."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    Very quickly, because I have one more question.\n    Mr. DiMare. Sure. What the Florida tomato industry has \nimplemented has been unprecedented in the produce industry. We \nvoluntarily as a group adopted a food safety program that is \ngoing to be mandated by the State of Florida Commissioner of \nAgriculture's office, and it covers all producers of tomatoes, \nbig and small."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    So you think it is a model we ought to look at?\n    Mr. DiMare. I think it certainly is a model and other \nstates are currently looking at it."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    Dr. Osterholm, I concur with you about the \nimpacts of, again it gets to be, and I have many of them in my \ndistrict and there are many cases of immigrants trying to live \nthe American dream, growing on a couple acres. But, they go and \nthere isn't the sort of safety requirements and standards and I \ndo think it is a potential problem when they drop off a load in \na small restaurant. The accountability and the thoroughness is \na question, at least for me, even though I certainly support \ntheir efforts. As it relates to that, there has been discussion \nabout the epidemiology studies, and it is my understanding that \nthere aren't any standards for the questions that are asked of \nindividuals who got sick. How can you compare in terms of the \npossible food eaten to find any commonality if you don't have \nany uniformity in the data that is being collected? I think, is \nat least in my mind, there seems to be an issue there.\n    Dr. Osterholm. Congressman, you are exactly right on \ntarget, and that is part of what we propose to require of this \nnational system. There are efforts underway right now to help \nimprove upon that, an organization called CIFOR, which is a \ncombination of public health agencies trying to come up with \nstandards for this kind of investigation for when you move that \nforward, and so I think you are exactly right."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    So uniformity in the information required by the \nstates is something that we ought to be looking at in any \nproposed legislation?\n    Dr. Osterholm. Well, uniformity to the extent that, think \nof a criminal investigation. There is no one form you fill out, \nthere is no one set of pictures you take but there are certain \nstandards of how you gather evidence at a crime scene. Each one \nis going to be different, whether it is in a building, whether \nit is outside, whether it is in the middle of the summer or the \nwinter. The same thing is true with foodborne outbreaks. Each \none will be a little different but there should be uniformity \nof standards and approaches that could be replicated whether \nthat happens in California, Minnesota, Texas or New York, the \nsame approaches would be taken, and that is what is being \nattempted to be put in place now but it is not done."
"costa","Mr. Costa","costa","Mr. Costa","    Okay. That is very helpful.\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n    The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Costa. I appreciate your \nquestions.\n    I have asked this question a couple different ways \nthroughout the day, and that is, how the fact that we have now \ntraced it back to Mexico, how many outbreaks there have been. \nWe are waiting for more of that information and we will be \ncompiling that information. But I think, Mr. Stenzel, I believe \nit was your testimony, and I want to make this point as well, \nthat American farmers weren't the only ones that were affected \nhere, that there may be a lot of places in Mexico that grow \njalapenos or serranos. But, it was only one farm and all those \nother farms in Mexico were implicated by regional name, but \nweren't necessarily any worse than the American farmers on this \nside of the border. So while I object when the protocols aren't \nthe same south of the border as they are north of the border \nand where there are different pesticide regulations and there \nare all the different issues that I have complained so \nvigorously about other countries competing with our farmers on \na different playing field, different levels. How I believe that \nour folks are subjected to the most rigorous standards, and I \nsupport those standards, but how others may not have to do \nthat. I want to make the point very clearly and let you \ncomment, that Mexican farmers have been affected in a way as \nwell, that they have been affected by this recall the same way \nas others have.\n    Mr. Stenzel. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The bottom-line \nmessage I would leave is that food safety is the responsibility \nof the individual producer and they can get it right and they \ncan get it wrong and it doesn't really matter where they are. \nWe have to look at equivalent systems. We have to look at the \nfair playing field and the same rules but ultimately food \nsafety is the responsibility of that individual producer.\n    The Chairman. Thank you.\n    Now, another question very briefly to Mr. Silbermann and \nMr. Stenzel, if the current traceback system works, what is the \nrush on the part of industry players in moving forward with its \nproduce traceability initiative? Second, what is the timing of \nimplementation of that initiative? And third, Representative \nDeGette's bill requires FDA to mandate traceability systems \nthat enable the Secretary to retrieve history use and location \nof an article. I would like you to briefly comment on those \nthree questions.\n    Mr. Silbermann. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Number one, the \nproduce traceability initiative began long before this current \noutbreak, so please don't see this as a reaction to this \noutbreak. It has been underway since the end of last year and \nwe have a desire to do this because it is going to take several \nyears to have complete implementation of this. I mean, it is a \nlong process because people have to get numbers from the \nstandards bodies, apply numbers and then build the system, so \nwe must get started. We understand that.\n    As far as a timeline for implementation, that will be \ndecided at the meeting on August 20 of the steering committee, \nand we will make that available publicly once that has been \napproved.\n    Finally, we believe that the degree of record-keeping that \nalready exists in the industry when married to this \nelectronically scannable information on every box will in fact \nbe in the best interests of the industry to require and buyers \nhave already committed that they are going to ask their \nsuppliers for this. Major buyers have already said we want to \nhave this information on the box. So I believe that industry, \nthe force of the market will drive adoption of this. I do not \nbelieve at this time that regulation is required. I think that \nregulatory authority already exists whether in PACA or in the \nBioterrorism Act.\n    The Chairman. Thank you.\n    Mr. Stenzel.\n    Mr. Stenzel. Quickly, we believe FDA already has the \nauthority to mandate any kind of traceability systems they \nbelieve without legislation. Look at enforcement of the \nBioterrorism Act. What cases have been brought in any of the \nconcern about traceability that people were not complying? We \njust don't see that as an issue. Why are we moving forward? \nStandardization, efficiency across the industry. We think that \nis important. We talked about the little stickers on the fruit. \nAt one time every grocery chain had a different numbering \nsystem. They still could look up the cost of the produce. It \nstill worked. But we moved as an industry to standardize that \nand that is what we are trying to do here, get all of our case \nlabeling on the same standard format.\n    The Chairman. I am going to actually turn it back to Mr. \nMahoney. You had one more question?"
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","costa","Mr. Costa","    Well, no, I was just going to thank everybody \nfor coming because I recognize how difficult it is, and I guess \nthe last thing I was just going to ask is, I think it was Mr. \nStenzel that pointed out the fact that it has been an effort \nwith me and several of the Members to do some compensation. My \nconcern, of course, is that I believe that food safety and \nnational security are synonymous. We are down to two percent of \nthe population feeding the other 98 percent. This has been the \nmost expensive year in history to plant a crop and we need to \nbe figuring out, and one thing I love about the Agriculture \nCommittee is that we go to work every day trying to figure out \nhow to make agriculture stronger in this country and \nprofitability is one of the things.\n    So given the fact that crop insurance doesn't cover this, \nis it a general consensus among the Members that there needs to \nbe some form of compensation or that would be justified in this \nsituation? Whether or not we can get it is another issue, but \nwe have to convince other Members to do this and I guess the \nPresident at some point. But do you feel from an industry \nperspective that this is warranted or merited? Why don't we \nstart with Mr. Giclas?\n    Mr. Giclas. We are here specifically to raise that issue so \nwe are very supportive of that, and I also agree wholeheartedly \nthat we need to look at mechanisms like crop insurance for \nevents like government action."
"mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Mr. DiMare?\n    Mr. DiMare. Certainly from the producer's side, and I can \nspeak from a company standpoint, our losses as a total company \nare approaching about $18 million, so again, as it was stated \nearlier, this is not an action that was caused by us and \nproducers so there has got to be some accountability and \ncompensation."

break,break,break,break
"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Dr. Gorny. Thank you, Mr. Cardoza. Thank you for the \nopportunity to be here. As you said, I am Dr. Jim Gorny. I am \nwith the Postharvest Technology Research and Information Center \nat the University of California at Davis. Our center's mission \nis to reduce postharvest losses and enhance the quality, safety \nand marketability of fresh horticultural crops.\n    First and foremost, I want to express my sympathies to all \nwho have been adversely affected by this foodborne illness \noutbreak and to say I hope to provide at least some small \nassistance to this Subcommittee to enhance the consumer and \nmarketplace confidence in our nation's food supply.\n    I am going to echo a lot of the themes that were heard \nearlier today. First and foremost, enhanced produce \ntraceability may certainly play an important role as a means of \nbolstering the safety of our food supply but by no means should \nit be seen as a panacea. Traceability and recall procedures \nmust be viewed as the last line of defense, not the first line \nof defense, in preventing foodborne illnesses.\n    Today I would like to address current industry practices \nand possible means of enhancing the health and safety of our \nfood supply in America in general. First and foremost, with \nregard to current handling practices, we have heard a lot today \nabout the Bioterrorism Act. Both in the Code of Federal \nRegulations and specific provisions of the Bioterrorism Act \nrequire traceability by everyone up and down the food supply \nchain. The rules promulgated by FDA regarding the Bioterrorism \nAct do require that everyone in the supply chain within a \nreasonable amount of time, meaning less than 24 hours, be able \nto tell who they received product from and who they \nsubsequently shipped product to. These rules promulgated by FDA \ndo not specify a uniform reporting format, they do not require \nelectronic record-keeping and they do not prohibit commingling \nof food products. As has been mentioned earlier, while FDA has \nreported numerous difficulties in the recent traceback \ninvestigation, to my knowledge, no enterprise has been found to \nbe in violation of the Bioterrorism Act provisions regarding \nrecord-keeping.\n    Now, commingling of food by various suppliers is not unique \nto the produce industry. It happens also, for instance, in lots \nof baking flour which may be commingled in storage silos, so \nwhy does the produce industry commingle produce? For example, \ntomatoes are picked at a mature green stage and basically they \nare shipped off in long distances to the marketplace for \nripening and size sorting before being shipped to grocers and \nrestaurants. Green tomatoes simply ship much better. They \nbruise less easily and there are less postharvest losses. The \nripening and size sorting of tomatoes does occur at repacking \noperations and it offers a real value-added service to \nretailers and restaurateurs because no consumer wants to eat a \nsmall green tomato on their sandwich or on their hamburger.\n    Now, because tomatoes are often not uniform in size and \nripeness when they are picked, there may be insufficient \nquantities in any given lot to meet customer demands or needs \nso there will be commingling at the repacking facility to meet \ngrocer and restaurateur needs.\n    We also talked a lot about epidemiology today and I would \nlike to discuss that in a little bit of detail. Epidemiology is \nall about finding commonalities to ultimately determine where \ntainted food came from, how it got contaminated and prevent \noccurrences in the future. Undoubtedly, tomato commingling can \nconfound an investigation, but in this case, it seems to be \nimperative as we move forward to determine if produce \ntraceability did work or didn't work. Was the lack of \ncommonality or patterns in the tomato traceability \ninvestigation simply indicated that tomatoes were not the \ntainted food causing the illnesses.\n    Now, in fact, we know that it is jalapenos and again, I \nwould like to address how the Minnesota Department of Public \nHealth broke this case. They used different agencies. They used \nthe Department of Agriculture in Minnesota, and it points out \nthe benefits of public health agencies collaborating with other \nagencies.\n    Can traceability be improved? Yes, absolutely, and we heard \nfrom the industry today talking about their GTIN initiative \nwith regard to electronic records. It will certainly provide a \ncommon electronic language for produce traceability.\n    Last but not least, with regard to protecting public health \nand some recommendations, the food industry, government and the \npublic should be very concerned about public health officials' \nlagging response time and inability to quickly identify what \nfood is making people sick. Broad advisories by the FDA to \nconsumers not to consume certain foods should be a regulatory \ntool of last resort to protect public health. It is a huge \ndisincentive for private enterprises to invest in robust food \nsafety programs and traceability systems if they offer no \nprotection to industry-wide shutdowns by broad public health \nadvisories. In short, a focused approach is what is needed, and \nmore resources and cooperation are what is needed.\n    I am going to sum up a few specific recommendations. First \nand foremost, I think we have heard today we need increased \nunderstanding by public health officials regarding how specific \nfood industry sectors produce, process and handle and \ndistribute foods. The University of California at Davis stands \nready to assist CDC and FDA in helping them understand how the \nproduce industry works. We need development of a harmonized \napproach to foodborne illness outbreak investigations among the \nvarious agencies at the Federal and state level. An agency \nshould engage academia and industry personnel as well as \ngovernment who have specialized working knowledge about \nindustry segments. We need increased capacity building at FDA \nand CDC, as Dr. Osterholm talked about. We need increased \ntransparency to understand and have confidence in the CDC and \nFDA's decision-making process regarding foodborne illness \noutbreak investigations. And last, we need accelerated \nharmonization of the traceability initiative by the industry.\n    In conclusion, it is imperative that we all work together \nto ensure the safety of fresh produce because these foods play \nsuch an important and central role in maintaining good health \nof our population.\n    I would like to thank you for the opportunity to address \nthe Subcommittee and provide my professional perspectives. \nThank you."

"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    While FDA has reported numerous difficulties and specifically \ntomato commingling, in this recent traceback investigation, to my \nknowledge, no enterprise has been found by the FDA to be in violation \nof Bioterrorism Act provisions regarding record-keeping.\n    Commingling of food from various suppliers is not unique to the \nproduce industry, another example would be lots of flour for baking \nwhich may be commingled in storage silos. The practice of commingling \ntomatoes has been reported by the FDA to be particularly problematic in \nhampering their recent investigations to identify the cause of the \nrecent Salmonella Saintpaul foodborne illness outbreak. So why does the \nproduce industry commingle produce.\n    Current Industry Practices: Tomatoes are commonly picked when they \nare at the mature green stage of ripeness. These green tomatoes are \nthen shipped, often long distances near to the marketplace for ripening \nand sizing sorting before being shipped to grocers and restaurants. \nThis is done because green tomatoes ship much better than ripe tomatoes \nthat are very susceptible to bruising and postharvest losses. Ripening \nand repacking operations which ripen and size sort tomatoes offer a \nvery real value added service because no consumer wants to purchase of \nconsume a small green tomato on their sandwich or hamburger.\n    Because tomatoes are not uniform in size and shape and there may be \ninsufficient quantities of tomatoes from any one lot, different lots of \nproducts may be commingled and then sent to grocers and restaurants.\nSalmonella Saintpaul Foodborne Illness Investigation\n    Determining in an epidemiological investigation where tainted food \ncame from (which store, then which distributor, then which grower/\nshipper/packer) by identifying commonalities among where ill \nindividuals purchased their food, is critical to ultimately identifying \nthe most likely root cause of contamination and thus providing the \npossibility of making sure such contamination never occurs in a similar \nmanner again.\n    Epidemiology is all about finding a common thread and traceback is \nonly a part of the epidemiological investigation.\n    Undoubtedly, commingling as in the case of tomatoes has the \npotential to confound and hamper traceback investigations. In this case \nit will be important to determine if produce traceability did or did \nnot work and if the lack of commonality or patterns in the tomato \ntraceback investigation simply indicated that tomatoes were not the \ntainted food causing the illnesses.\n    Epidemiologists when investigating a foodborne illness outbreak \nmust be extremely careful in assuring that the link between what ill \npersons ate and where they purchased that food item from is factually \ncorrect. If a false assumption is made early in the investigation \nprocess (i.e., wrong food product or wrong point of purchase) it leads \nthe epidemiological investigation down the wrong distribution chain, \nthus wasting time, resources and ultimately delaying the identification \nof the true cause of the illnesses.\n    It has now come to light, that in fact jalapeno peppers are the \nmost likely food product responsible for this recent almost nationwide \nsalmonellosis outbreak, through epidemiological evidence gathered by \nthe Minnesota Department of Public Health and jalapeno peppers samples \ntesting positive for the presence of Salmonella Saintpaul with a \nsimilar genetic fingerprint to the outbreak strain.\n    It is interesting to note is that in an AP news report on July 24, \n2008, reporting about how jalapeno peppers were identified as like \ncause of this foodborne illness outbreak Ben Miller of the Minnesota \nDepartment of Agriculture said, ``A few phone calls and you can work it \nfairly quickly back to the grower''. This seems to point out the \ntraceability does seem to be working in the produce industry and it \nalso points out the benefits for public health agencies to use allied \nagencies with complimentary expertise during investigations.\n    Can traceability in the produce industry be improved? Absolutely \nyes, the produce industry does have an opportunity to more effectively \naid public health investigations into foodborne illness outbreaks by \nhaving a uniform format of electronic records. This task developing and \nadopting a harmonized format of electronic records for traceability has \nactually already been initiated by a joint task force of produce \nindustry trade associations. This group is working on development and \nuse of what is called Global Trade Item Numbers (GTIN) which provides a \ncommon electronic language for traceability for the produce industry.\n2. Protecting Public Health\n    The food industry, government and the public should be concerned \nabout public health officials lagging response time and inability to \nquickly identify what food is making people ill.\n    First and foremost public health agencies are currently fragmented \nand under-resourced to effectively monitor and respond rapidly to \ndeveloping public health issues. Each and every foodborne illness \noutbreak investigation is an opportunity to enhance investigation team \nresponse time.\n    Broad advisories by FDA to consumers not to consume certain foods \nshould be a regulatory tool of last resort to protect public health. It \nis a huge disincentive for private enterprises to invest in robust food \nsafety programs and traceability systems, if they offer no protection \nagainst industry wide shut downs by broad public health advisories. A \nmore focused approach is needed to protect public health and commerce. \nThis recent foodborne illness outbreak has tarnished FDA's reputation \nand credibility with consumers and businesses alike, many of whom \ncontinued to sell and consume jalapeno peppers despite FDA's blanket \nadvisory against their consumption. This is simply unprecedented and \nparadigm shift in how people perceive the FDA's public health \nrecommendations.\n    Simply put more resources and cooperation are needed to adequately \nprotect public health and commerce.\n    Specific recommendations include,"

break,break,break,break
"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Ms. Halloran. My name is Jean Halloran and I am Director of \nFood Policy Initiatives for Consumers Union, the nonprofit \npublisher of Consumer Reports, and I suppose there is always \nsomething to be said for having the last word.\n    The Chairman. My kids always try and get it, so I know it \nis important.\n    Ms. Halloran. This foodborne illness outbreak involving \nSalmonella Saintpaul in produce, which has now been linked to \npeppers grown in Mexico, shows quite clearly that traceability \noffers a way to protect consumers better, use our regulatory \nresources more efficiently and effectively, and limit the \nlosses of produce growers.\n    We believe that had a good traceability system been in \nplace for tomatoes 4 months ago, and I would like to say that \ntraceability is something supported by 86 percent of consumers \nin a recent AP-Ipsos poll, had that been in place, FDA would \nhave gotten to the bottom of this problem much more quickly. \nWith traceability, investigators could more quickly have \nfollowed what people were eating back trough the distribution \nchain and all its repacking and remixing stages, could more \nquickly have sampled along that chain, and could more quickly \nhave understood that tomatoes were most likely not the primary \nsource of the problem. This could have helped FDA and CDC turn \ntheir attention sooner to foods eaten in association with \ntomatoes and thus to the jalapenos that we are now considering \nso seriously.\n    We see two options for upgrading traceability. At a \nminimum, we believe that products should have labels on the \npackages and boxes and where possible on the product itself \nthat show the country, facility, date and time where the \nproduct was first processed and shipped. I was very encouraged \nby the testimony of the Produce Marketing Association that they \nhave such a scheme in process. It is essential that this be \nmandated for everyone and not just be voluntary because it is \nthe gaps that will cause the problem and slow down a traceback \nprocess. This can be implemented on the very same stickers that \nwill show a product's country of origin, which is going to be \nmandatory for imported produce in October of this year.\n    Even more effective is what we call the FedEx model in \nwhich each product gets a code on it that can be read as the \nproduct moves through the process and will enable it to be \ntracked through the distribution system. Then if you come up \nwith a contaminated pepper, you could look back and see all the \nplaces it has been and all the places it might have been \ncontaminated or contaminated something else. We know that there \nare important issues to resolve here including ensuring that \nall handlers log in and log out shipments and also whose \ncomputer will process all this tracking data. But, we do \nbelieve that Congress should mandate full traceability on the \nFedEx model, and unless it is mandated, you will not get \ncompliance with foreign producers and small producers. I would \nsay for very small producers, this is not really an issue \nbecause if something goes direct from the producer to a \nfarmer's market, you don't need traceability. There is nothing \nto trace. You are buying from the producer.\n    The Chairman. Both the consumer and the producer know who \ndid it, right?\n    Ms. Halloran. Yes. The alternative to these options is the \npresent situation with the consequences we have just been \ndiscussing. I would like to emphasize that FDA has no choice \nbut to inform the public when it has strong suspicions about \ncontamination. Consumers need to be able to take precautionary \nactions to protect themselves in such situations and FDA cannot \nwithhold information from them that would better allow them to \ntake precautions for themselves and their loved ones. \nTherefore, we must learn to prevent these situations and to not \nhave the investigations drag on.\n    In addition to traceability, we feel that other preventive \nmeasures are really important, as others have stated. One is a \nsubstantial increase in resources for FDA. Another is FDA \nshould be required to develop standards for processing \nfacilities. A third is that FDA should be required to enforce \nclear performance standards for contaminants in produce. USDA \ndata, a recent study shows that there are higher levels of \npesticides in imported salad vegetables than in domestic, so we \nneed enforcement of standards. FDA is not enforcing \nsufficiently at the border. They said only one percent was \nbeing looked at. They visit facilities only once every 5 to 10 \nyears, foreign facilities even less frequently, although we \nbelieve they need it more. Finally, they should have mandatory \nrecall authority and disclose the stores that carry recalled \nproducts.\n    This Congress has much to do and little time to do it in \nbut we think these issues are urgent and we urge you to tackle \nthese issues now. Thank you."

"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","Prepared Statement of Jean Halloran, Director, Food Policy Initiatives, \n                      Consumers Union, Yonkers, NY\n    Thank you for the opportunity to testify today on traceability and \nits potential use in fresh produce. My name is Jean Halloran and I am \nDirector of Food Policy Initiatives for Consumers Union, nonprofit \npublisher of Consumer Reports.\n    This is a timely and important hearing because we are still in the \nmidst of a serious foodborne illness outbreak involving Salmonella \nSaintpaul in produce, which has now been linked to peppers grown in \nMexico.\\1\\ This outbreak shows quite clearly that traceability offers a \nway to protect consumers better, use our regulatory resources more \nefficiently and effectively, and limit losses of produce growers when \nfood safety problems emerge.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\1\\ FDA Statement, ``U.S. Grown Jalapeno and Serrano Peppers Not \nConnected to Salmonella Saintpaul Outbreak,'' July 25, 2008.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    We are now in an era of a globalized food supply. Food products \nmove around the United States and are imported from other countries as \nnever before. Unfortunately our systems for insuring the safety of food \nhave not kept up with the changes in production and distribution \nsystems. Congress can and should address the need to modernize FDA to \ndeal with these new challenges. We urge you to require full \ntraceability as part of this much needed overhaul. Consumers \noverwhelmingly like this concept: an Associated Press-Ipsos poll shows \nthat 86 percent of consumers support traceability.\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\2\\ http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/wire/ats-ap-ap-\npoll-food-safetyjul20,0,428028.story.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFood Safety Incidents\n    We are now facing significant problems as to the safety of our \nfood. The current tomato/jalapeno Salmonella Saintpaul outbreak is just \nlatest example. This foodborne illness outbreak has sickened more than \n1,200 people, sent more than 200 to the hospital, and contributed to \ntwo deaths. As is usually true in such disease outbreaks, the deaths \ntend to affect the very young, the very old and those with compromised \nimmune systems, and in this case the Salmonella contributed to the \ndeaths of two elderly gentlemen.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\3\\ http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/saintpaul/.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    This outbreak follows several others in the last 2 years that have \ninvolved significant numbers of illnesses, including Salmonella in \npeanut butter,\\4\\ where the problem originated in a Georgia processing \nplant, and E. coli in spinach, where the contamination apparently \noccurred on a California farm.\\5\\ There have also been problems with \nprohibited chemicals in seafood, stemming from use of the chemicals at \naquaculture facilities in China.\\6\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \\4\\ FDA News, ``FDA Warns Consumers Not to Eat Certain Jars of \nPeter Pan Peanut Butter and Great Value Peanut Butter Product May be \nContaminated With Salmonella,'' February 14, 2007.\n    \\5\\ FDA News, ``FDA Finalizes Report on 2006 Spinach Outbreak,'' \nMarch 23, 2007.\n    \\6\\ FDA News, ``FDA Detains Imports of Farm-Raised Chinese Seafood; \nProducts Have Repeatedly Contained Potentially Harmful Residues,'' June \n28, 2007.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    The tomato/jalapeno case is still not resolved, in that the Food \nand Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control have so far \nnot traced the problem back definitively to its source or sources. \nUntil they are able to do that, we cannot be sure that the outbreak is \nover, or that it will not start up again. Although some 1,200 cases \nhave been officially reported to CDC, it is likely that many more \npeople have been and could still be affected. Experts estimate that for \nevery reported case in an outbreak of this type, three to ten times as \nmany people may be affected, but are not counted because they don't see \na doctor, or their doctor doesn't seek to identify the bacterium \ncausing their problem.\n    This case in particular has highlighted the need to establish \ntraceability systems in produce. FDA's original hypothesis, based on \ncase control analyses by CDC of what victims ate, was that tomatoes \nwere the problem food. FDA then began the extremely labor intensive \nprocess of trying to traceback the tomatoes that the people had eaten, \nhoping to find the source of their Salmonella infection. Unfortunately \nthey found that tomatoes go through many hands and are mixed and \nrepackaged often. Thus trying to traceback one person's tomato became \nan enormous task, with trails branching again and again. The mystery \ndragged on for weeks, resulting in confusion for consumers and hundreds \nof millions of dollars in losses for our nation's tomato growers.\n    We believe that had a good traceability system been in place for \ntomatoes 4 months ago, FDA would have gotten to the bottom of this \nproblem much more quickly. With traceability, FDA investigators could \nmuch more quickly have followed what people ate back through the \ndistribution chain, could much more quickly have sampled along that \nchain, and could much more quickly understood that tomatoes were most \nlikely not the source of the problem. This would have helped it turn \nits attention earlier to foods eaten in association with tomatoes, and \nthus to jalapenos where last week the Salmonella strain was identified.\nOptions for Traceability\n    We currently have very limited traceability for food, which are not \nsufficient. The current system, wherein those in the produce industry \nkeep paper records that indicate one step forward and one step back in \nthe supply chain, creates an enormous amount of work for any regulatory \nagency trying to follow a trail.\n    We see two options for upgrading traceability at this time. One \nwould be relatively easy to implement. We believe that at a minimum, we \nshould have labels or marks on produce packages and boxes, and where \npossible on the product itself (such as with fruit), that show country, \nfacility, date and time where the item was first processed or shipped. \nThe label or mark should allow the product to be traced all the way \nback to the farm. This can be implemented in the form of a numerical or \nbar code on the very same sticker that will already show the product's \ncountry of origin--which is mandatory for imported products in October \nof this year. Such facility/date/time of processing information was \npresent on the packages of bagged spinach that were found to contain \ndangerous E. coli in 2006, and it allowed FDA to quickly--within a \ncouple of weeks, instead of months--identify and isolate the source of \nthe contaminated spinach.\n    An even more effective option, though somewhat more difficult to \nimplement, is what we think of as the ``FedEx model.'' In this model, \neach lot being shipped would get a label like that on a FedEx package \nthat would enable its progress to be tracked throughout the food \ndistribution system. Then if you had a contaminated pepper, you could \nlook back and see all the places it had been, and therefore all the \nplaces it could have been contaminated. We do understand that there \nwould be many issues to resolve to implement such a system, including \nhow to ensure that all handlers log in and log out their shipments, and \nwhose computer would process all the tracking data on shipments in \nprocess. Still, if FedEx can do it, why not the tomato industry?\n    The alternative to implementing one of these options is the present \nsituation where it is enormously difficult for FDA in certain cases to \npinpoint the source of an outbreak. This has unfortunate consequences \nfor consumers, the regulators and the industry. First, FDA wastes \nenormous financial resources getting to the bottom of the problem. \nSecond, FDA has no choice but to inform the public when it has strong \nsuspicions about contamination--as it did in the case of tomatoes--even \nthough we know that an initial hypothesis, no matter how sensible and \njustified, may turn out to be incorrect. FDA must do this because not \nto do so would be irresponsible. Salmonella, E. coli and Campylobacter \ninfections can all result in deaths, particularly of the most \nvulnerable such as young children, the very old, and the sick. \nConsumers need to be able to take precautionary actions to protect \nthemselves in such situations, and FDA cannot withhold information from \nthem that would better allow them to protect themselves and their loved \nones. But consumers may needlessly discard good produce and avoid \nhealthful foods as a result, and growers may experience enormous \nfinancial losses.\n    To prevent such precaution-taking from having a devastating impact \non an industry, FDA must be able to get to the bottom of a problem \nquickly and efficiently. To do this we need product traceability.\nAdditional Reforms Needed\n    As much as traceability will help, however, the ability to \ntraceback in response to a disease outbreak is not the whole solution. \nFDA should be acting proactively to prevent these outbreaks from \noccurring in the first place. FDA also needs other enhancements to its \nresources and authority to be able to prevent as well as respond to \nfood safety problems effectively. We urge Congress provide the \nfollowing so that FDA can function as a 21st century food safety \nagency:"

"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    The Chairman. Thank you, Ms. Halloran. Thank you very much \nto both of you. I have a couple of questions that I want to \nask.\n    First of all for Dr. Gorny, do you believe adoption of the \nGlobal Trade Item Number, GTIN, electronic traceability format, \nshould be accelerated? You also have acknowledged that one of \nthe most difficult aspects of creating that traceability \nprogram is dealing with the issue of commingling of produce at \ndifferent stages along the way. Does this format provide \nappropriate level of granularity to address the current risks \nand concerns?\n    Dr. Gorny. First and foremost, I believe that the GTIN \nstandard that is being put forward by the trade groups in \nproduce will be a huge step forward, a great leap forward with \nregard to the ability to trace product. The reason being that \nit puts it on a common format and an electronic format, exactly \nwhat FDA has said has been a huge problem with regard to these \ntraceback investigations. The second part of your question is, \nI think if we provide--you are never going to get away from \ncommingling of produce. You are never going to get away from \ncommingling of all food products. You just have to deal with \nthat at a most appropriate level, and it is at a per-box level \nso you know that potentially two potential suppliers may have \nput product into that potential box, and I think it is possible \nto closely segregate, so I think it is a huge step forward.\n    The Chairman. Thank you.\n    Ms. Halloran, your recommendations for traceback systems, \ndo you envision establishing a single traceback system for all \nfood products or do you see different systems for different \nproducts?\n    Ms. Halloran. I am not certain of the most appropriate \nmethod. I think it may well be for different industries you \nneed different systems and they may need to be maintained by \nindustry associations or other entities, but you need a uniform \nframework. There needs to be uniform criteria for how this is \ndone so that there are certain minimum criteria and that FDA \ncan use them simply and don't have to learn a new system every \ntime.\n    The Chairman. During the farm bill discussion, I had \nserious conversations with the Chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, Mr. Harkin. We tried to figure out how \nwe were going to do this and there is a genuine commitment on \nhis part to wanting to move along these lines. We had a method \nin the House bill that he didn't feel comfortable with. One of \nthe arguments that I made to him was, there are 350-some \ncommodities in the food world but within those there are so \nmany subsets, different types of varietals, and to develop \ndifferent protocols for each one of those on food safety \nmeasures is very difficult. The industries that do that though \ncan individually can come up with it. So we were having a very \ndifficult time. My question for Ms. Halloran is, should FDA \nstart by establishing a traceback system for high-risk products \nor handle all products simultaneously, knowing that it is very \ncomplex and the record of agencies developing regulations and \nprotocols is not that great in this country? It takes a long \ntime. I think the quickest one we have ever seen is 18 months \nto 2 years, and you multiply that times 350 and you are looking \nat the next century before we will finally get to food safety \nby that criteria. I think we can do it another way but I would \nlike to hear your testimony.\n    Ms. Halloran. Yes, I think that to have FDA try to \nmicromanage this would be probably a mistake, and that some of \nthe basic--the three things that the produce manufacturers were \ntalking about--we were thinking, basically four facts, the \ncountry of origin, the facility of origin, the date and the \ntime of the shipment for the original product. If that ended up \non that sticker that annoyingly we are always pulling off as \nthe consumer, that would be a huge leg up on the traceback \nprocess, would be very simple to do and all you need is a \nnumerical system that is common to everyone which obviously the \nproduce industry is already well in the process of developing.\n    The Chairman. Thank you. I appreciate your acknowledgement \nof that. Frankly, I think that our farmers and our distributors \nin this country have done a miraculous job producing the \nvolumes they do at the costs. Even at the higher costs that we \nare now seeing in the supermarket, we are certainly lower than \nmost parts of the world and pay less for our food than most \nparts of the world do, and it is, in my opinion, safer than \nmany parts of the world. It is not always safe but it is safer \nthan what is typically, in my opinion, available in many parts \nof the world. But that is my editorial comment.\n    Ms. Halloran. I really have to say, I think we can say we \nhave one of the safest food supplies in the world. I really do \nthink that, for example, many countries of the European Union \nare now ahead of us, if you look at the statistics, so we \nreally don't want to lose our edge on that area and we have \nsome work to do to keep up.\n    The Chairman. Thank you. At this point, I want to thank you \nboth for your testimony. I want to thank all our panelists. I \nwant to thank the audience. I want to give a special thanks to \nthe staff, both the Minority and the Majority staff, who have \ndone a fabulous job preparing this hearing and getting all our \nwitnesses here today.\n    Under the rules of the Committee, the record for today's \nhearing will remain open for 10 days to receive additional \nmaterial and supplementary written responses from the witnesses \nto any question posed by a Member of the panel.

"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Dear Chairman Cardoza,"
break,break,break,break
"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    On behalf of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, a trade \nassociation representing more than 125 member importers of produce \nlocated in Nogales, Arizona, we would like to submit this written \ntestimony for the record. FPAA was founded in 1944 to represent the \nU.S. importers of produce from Mexico, an industry that is a vital part \nof the U.S. border and regional economy, the port of Nogales imports \n$1.5-$2.5 billion annually. Our industry provides jobs and contributes \nsignificantly to the U.S. economy, particularly in the southern border \nregion of the United States, but also down the supply chain including \ndistributors, retailers and restaurants. In the context of this \nhearing, it should be noted that FPAA also represents the majority of \nthe distributors and importers of tomatoes from Mexico. With all due \nrespect, we would like to suggest that for future hearings on food \nsafety for produce that FPAA be included as a witness. Based on our \nlong history in the business, we have many facts and practices to share \nabout food safety from the unique importer position in the market.\n    At the outset, we would like to thank Chairman Cardoza for holding \nthis balanced, fair and positive hearing seeking solutions and \nimprovement in the area of food safety for produce. In this important \narea, where confidence of the U.S. food supply is at issue, we cannot \nindulge in finger pointing but must move forward together to ensure \nconsumer confidence in our products. Produce is a healthy product, \nessential for a healthy diet. At a time when obesity and related \nillnesses are costing consumers and the U.S. taxpayers as much as \nbillions of dollars annually in healthcare costs, we must not \ndiscourage consumption of fresh produce. In the recently passed farm \nbill, the Congress wisely funded the U.S. school snack program at a \nlevel of about $1 billion annually to provide fresh produce to under-\nprivileged children with the goal that child nutrition and long-term \neating habits would be established for the U.S. population in years to \ncome. We cannot let unwarranted fears undermine this progress toward \nimproved nutrition. For these reasons, it is important that we improve \nthe FDA-CDC response to outbreaks and ensure balance in communication \nabout risk.\n    With regard to produce, we view the industry as the North American \nindustry. The produce industry, whether in the United States, Canada or \nMexico operates in an integrated manner. Our products share supply \nchains and distribution points and there is substantial cross ownership \nof production by multiple entities across national lines. As you are \naware, for example, California-based produce companies in many \ninstances have growing operations in California and in Mexico as well. \nWith the increasing difficulty obtaining agriculture laborers in the \nUnited States, the trend on the part of U.S. companies to expand across \nthe border to Mexico will only continue. Another driver in this \nintegration is the globalization of supply as mandated by the larger \nretailer purchasers. These large purchasers demand high quality, \nreliable and safe product all year round. During the winter months, \nMexican fresh produce accounts for as much as 25 percent of U.S. \nproduce consumption. More than 4 billion pounds of produce enters the \nU.S. at Nogales, Arizona to meet the U.S. consumer demand for year-\nround, high-quality fresh produce. Evidence of this approach and \nintegration of the industry was clear in the course of the recent \ninvestigation of Salmonella Saintpaul in tomatoes where it was found \nthat many distributors sourced from U.S., Canada and Mexico at the same \ntime.\n    For food safety, this globalization of the market and the advent of \nlarge purchasers means that more and more all producers are being held \nto one food safety standard--the standard set by the purchaser. As any \nlarge retail outlet can validate, products are all held to the same \nfood safety standard regardless of the source of the product. For a \nretailer, their brand and reputation is at issue. The purchaser will \nremember where they purchased the product and not where the product was \nproduced. As a result, when there is a food safety incident, consumers \nwill stop purchasing the product regardless of the source. We have \nlearned this in the two biggest recent outbreaks: spinach from \nCalifornia and now peppers from Mexico. We have learned that consumers \nstop eating the product broadly--regardless of source. When there is a \nfood safety issue, the entire product category suffers a reduction in \nsales and severe economic loss.\n    Another lesson that we have learned from recent outbreaks is that \nwhile we ``are only as strong as our weakest link'' when it comes to \nfood safety that at the same time it is not always the small producer \nthat is the weakest link. In the case of spinach the failure did not \noccur within a small operation; whereas for peppers this appears to be \nthe case. What we know is that is regardless of geographic region or \nsize of an entity that food safety failures can occur. It is common \nsense backed up by science that risk cannot be reduced to zero. This \npoints to a fundamental principal that should be adopted in regulating \nfood safety: the cause of an outbreak is the failure in the system of \none specific entity--and not a failure of a geographic region or \nparticular type of entity. There should not be pre-conceived biases \nagainst particular products, particular size of entity or particular \ngeographic region. The only focus should be to quickly track, based on \nthe facts at hand, to a specific entity in order to pinpoint and close \nout that source.\n    In food safety, speed of an investigation is absolutely critical. \nOnce there has been an outbreak, the priority must be finding the \nsource of the contamination immediately. Undoubtedly, traceback is one \n(but not the only) critical element of the investigation. From the \nimporter perspective, we would like to note that in the recent tomato \nand chili pepper investigations, traceback did work across the border \ninto Mexico. There was no blackout of information or end of the trail \nat the border with Mexico. Tomatoes and peppers were traced from \nconsumer to farm in both instances. This is a very important point \nbecause some have suggested that whenever there is an outbreak that the \nborders should be shut down, as if there is something different about \ntraceback at the border. But this is not the case, as shown in the \ntomato and chili peppers investigations the traceback across the border \noccurred successfully and with no slow up. Under the Bioterrorism Act, \nforeign entities are required to register with the Department of Health \nand Human Services, Food and Drug Administration and are required to \nkeep records one step up and one step back just as domestic entities.\n    Further, with all due respect, in response to the misguided \nsuggestion, by several at the hearing, that a response to an outbreak \nshould be closing of U.S. borders to imports, we would like to point \nout that with regard to produce, imported products have not accounted \ndisproportionately for outbreaks. While including imports in the \nsolution is essential, it would not be sensible to target or single out \nimports as the problem for a different approach. The approach should be \nto continue to harmonize and standardize requirements so that all \nproducers are subject to the same standards and requirements.\n    A further point on standardization of requirements in the produce \nsector is that U.S. produce is not more highly regulated than Mexican \nor Canadian produce at the Federal level at this time. Good \nAgricultural Practices for produce in the U.S. are not mandatory. \nTherefore, making such requirements mandatory on imports would be \nholding imports to a higher standard than domestic products and there \nis no scientific justification for a difference in treatment. Any such \neffort to hold imports to a higher standard than domestic products \nwould be a violation of U.S. international obligations under the WTO. \nIn the past, mandatory GAPs for imports only has been made and been \nvetoed when reviewed by the United States Trade Representatives legal \ncounsel. It is a very important principle of international trade \nagreements that domestic and imported products be regulated in an \nequivalent manner so as to prevent an illegal trade barrier. The U.S. \nsubscribes to these international agreements so that U.S. products \n(including U.S. produce exported to Mexico, for example) will not be \nsubject to trade barriers going into Mexico.\n    Another clarification to make clear is that FDA does have extensive \nauthority to regulate imports of produce and to stop imports on a \ncompany-specific basis. Under its system of Detention Without Physical \nExamination and Import Alerts, the FDA has the authority (which it \nregularly and frequently uses) to prevent imports of a specific \nshipment, product, region or exporter. DWPE is based on past history or \nother information indicating the product may be a hazard. A product may \nthen be subject to a detention until the shipper or importer proves \nthat the product meets FDA standards. See http://www.foodsafety.gov/\n8lrd/imp-info.html In other words, the system for stopping even \nsuspicious products at the border is well-established. FDA, in effect, \ndoes have ``mandatory recall'' with regard to imports. Based on some of \nthe testimony and Member questions at the hearing, we are concerned \nthat the Members of Congress were not properly informed on how food \nsafety is enforced with regard to imports. We would be pleased to meet \nwith, answer questions and brief any Member or staff interested in \nunderstanding this issue and how it operates at the border from an \noperational perspective.\n    Whenever the issue of food safety is addressed, it is stated that \n``we cannot sample/inspect our way out of this problem'' and we would \nlike to agree with and explain this view. First, this reality applies \nequally to domestic production and to imports. It is not a theoretical \nstatement but rather a statement of fact. The volume of produce \nconsumed in the U.S. compared to the level of contamination is so small \nthat it is just not possible to always identify a 100 percent of the \ncontaminations through inspections. When there is an outbreak, FDA does \nnot begin testing every piece of produce in the U.S. because this would \nbe impossible. Instead, FDA initiates a traceback, a process of \npinpointing where to test in order to increase the odds of finding the \ncontamination. Unfortunately, in hearings on food safety, we do not \nseem to be able to move beyond this red herring quickly, and important \ntime is often wasted reviewing again this point.\n    It is because 100% testing and inspection (not based on any \ntargeting or risk response) is not the answer, that the industry \nrecommends preventative measures such as preventative controls (food \nsafety workplans) that are verifiable. As you have heard in every \nrecent hearing on food safety, the majority of the produce industry \nalready has verifiable food safety plans in place. Many of these are \nbased on established and scaleable practices that are verified by third \nparties. Some of these standards established by industry groups with \nwide input and are published by FDA on its website. These are adhered \nto by almost all producers of the covered products. With regard to \nimports, we would suggest the idea of ``pushing the border back'' which \nmeans that the focus should not be increased inspection at the border \nbut rather preventative and verifiable controls on the farms.\n    Following are some specific suggestions to FDA for improvement with \nregard to imports:"
break,break,break,break
"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    (1) Sampling time must be shortened"
break,break,break,break
"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    The lengthy delays in sampling by FDA are another unintended source \nof potential food safety problems for imports. In those situations \nwhere FDA decides to sample and analyze fresh produce, it currently \ntakes as long as 72 to 96 hours to obtain the analytical results and a \nrelease from FDA. Nearly 24 hours of that delay is consumed by the \nsampling and shipping process alone--delivering the sample to the FDA \nlaboratory. However, another 18 hours of delay occurs when FDA \nlaboratory analysts, with flexi-time schedules, arrive for work in the \nlab at 6:00 a.m., and leave by 2:00 p.m. When a sample of fresh product \narrives at the laboratory for analysis at 11:00 a.m. or noon (or \nlater), the analyst will wait until the next day to set up and run the \nsample. This additional delay compounds the damage to produce caused by \nincreased time and less-than-optimum storage conditions. In too many \ncases, by the time clean laboratory results are received and reported, \nthe fresh produce has already passed a quality point requiring it to be \ndiscarded. In this regard, FDA's testing processes, which are intended \nto ensure that an imported shipment is safe, ironically contributes \nsubstantially to the tested food being of such a lower level of quality \nthat it is no longer marketable--and yet FDA releases the shipment \nbecause of the clean analytical results."

"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    (2) Regulations and requirements must be updated through a \n        transparent process"
break,break,break,break
"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    FPAA deals at the border with a range of U.S. regulating agencies, \nincluding CBP and FDA. It is our experience that FDA appears to be \nunder-funded and not in control of its border function resulting in \narbitrary, unpredictable and non-uniform practices. This encourages \nexporters and importers to engage in ``forum shopping'' among ports and \nweak links in the food safety activities at the border. In our \nexperience FDA is somewhat a ``black box.'' The FDA has historically \noperated its import operations on the back of antiquated agency \npolicies and procedures, which were created in the 1970s. Chapter 9 of \nFDA's Regulatory Procedures Manual, a few regulations promulgated in \nthe last century, and the more recent Bioterrorism Act regulations \n(relating to prior notice of imported foods and registration of food \nfacilities) together represent the total sum of FDA policies and \nprocedures for managing as much as half of all of FDA's regulated \ncommodities in interstate commerce. FDA operates according to many \nunpublished internal procedures, and some districts have promulgated \nlocal policies and procedures to address certain isolated problems in \nthe importation process. However, the vast majority if FDA policies and \nrequirements are not published. Therefore Many of FDA's published \nprocedures (the RPM, the Investigation Operations Manual, Compliance \nPolicy Guides and Compliance Program Manual Guides) have no legal \neffect whatsoever; however, they are implemented as if they are \nregulations promulgated under the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act.\n    These and other incongruities could be resolved if FDA would \noperate with a level of transparency similar to Customs and Border \nProtection. Customs' local port offices also issue local procedures, \nbut they do so after entering into open and public dialogue with the \naffected industry. FPAA recommends FDA enter into a public dialogue \nwith the fresh produce industry to revise its procedures and policies \nrelevant to the agency's import operations."
break,break,break,break
"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    (3) Recognition of point of origin testing"
break,break,break,break
"","","mahoney","Mr. Mahoney","    Many Mexican fresh produce growers and packers already conduct \nroutine tests of product prior to shipment. FPAA urges that FDA begin \nrecognizing and incorporating into its own import risk screening \nprocess the routine, scientifically sound, and reliable laboratory \ntesting being conducted at the point of origin. FPAA believes this will \nassist the Agency in focusing its limited import inspection resources \non those shipments that have not been tested or that pose some \nadditional and identifiable risk factor. Many Mexican growers also \nimplement routine and rigorous water analyses and Good Agricultural \nPractices to ensure their products are safe for consumption. Although \neach of these components should eventually be considered in developing \na dynamic risk-based imported food safety program, point of origin \nsampling and analysis--whether the analysis is conducted in Mexico or \nin the U.S.--can quickly be incorporated into FDA's current decision \nmaking process when product arrives at the port of entry."
